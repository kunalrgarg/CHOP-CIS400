"We investigated the role of DGCR2, a corticogenesis-related gene, on schizophrenia (SZ) and its subphenotypes, including brain morphology. A total of 221 SZ patients, 263 controls and 70 antipsychotic-naive first episode of psychosis (FEP) were genotyped for 17 DGCR2 polymorphisms. While no association between DGCR2 polymorphisms and SZ was found, the missense variant rs2072123 was associated to left rostral anterior cingulate thickness, showing that DGCR2 seems not to be associated directly with the SZ but might be influencing the brain morphology. We also showed a DGCR2 downregulation in SZ patients when compared to controls and FEP.",DGCR2 influences cortical thickness through a mechanism independent of schizophrenia pathogenesis.
"The majority of studies of genetic association with disease have been performed in Europeans. This European bias has important implications for risk prediction of diseases across global populations. In this commentary, we justify the need to study more diverse populations using both empirical examples and theoretical reasoning.",The Missing Diversity in Human Genetic Studies.
"Coronary artery disease represents the leading cause of death worldwide, sparing no nation, ethnicity, or economic stratum. Coronary artery disease is partly heritable. While enormous effort has been devoted to understanding the genetic basis of coronary artery disease and other common, complex cardiovascular diseases, key challenges have emerged in gene discovery, in understanding how DNA variants connect to function, and in translation of genetics to the clinic. We discuss these challenges as well as promising opportunities to bring the work closer to fruition.","Genetics of Common, Complex Coronary Artery Disease."
"Importance: Mailing fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits to patients' homes has been shown to boost colorectal cancer screening rates, but response rates remain limited, and organized programs typically require repeated outreach attempts. Behavioral economics has shown that offering salient financial incentives to patients may increase participation in preventive health. Objective: To compare the impact of different financial incentives for mailed FIT outreach. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 4-parallel-arm randomized clinical trial included patients aged 50 to 75 years who had an established primary care clinician, at least 2 visits in the prior 2 years, and were eligible for colorectal cancer screening and not up-to-date. This study was conducted at urban primary care practices at an academic health system from December 2015 to February 2018. Data analysis was conducted from March 2018 to September 2018. Interventions: Eligible patients received a letter from their primary care clinician that included a mailed FIT kit and instructions for use. They were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive (1) no financial incentive; (2) an unconditional $10 incentive included with the mailing; (3) a $10 incentive conditional on FIT completion; or (4) a conditional lottery with a 1-in-10 chance of winning $100 after FIT completion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Fecal immunochemical test completion within 2 and 6 months of initial outreach. Results: A total of 897 participants were randomized, with a median age of 57 years (interquartile range, 52-62 years); 56% were women, and 69% were black. The overall completion rate across all arms was 23.5% at 2 months. The completion rate at 2 months was 26.0% (95% CI, 20.4%-32.3%) in the no incentive arm, 27.2% (95% CI, 21.5%-33.6%) in the unconditional incentive arm, 23.2% (95% CI, 17.9%-29.3%) in the conditional incentive arm, and 17.7% (95% CI, 13.0%-23.3%) in the lottery incentive arm. None of the arms with an incentive were statistically superior to the arm without incentive. The overall FIT completion rate across all arms was 28.9% at 6 months, and there was also no difference by arm. The completion rate at 6 months was 32.7% (95% CI, 26.6%-39.3%) in the no incentive arm, 31.7% (95% CI, 25.7%-38.2%) in the unconditional incentive arm, 26.8% (95% CI, 21.1%-33.1%) in the conditional incentive arm, and 24.3% (95% CI, 18.9%-30.5%) in the lottery incentive arm. Conclusions and Relevance: Mailed FIT resulted in high colorectal cancer screening response rates in this population, but different forms of financial incentives of the same expected value ($10) did not incrementally increase FIT completion rates. The incentive value may have been too small or financial incentives may not be effective in this context.

"Importance: The language of medical research appears to be intrinsically tied to the culture of medical research and provides a unique window into broader trends in the culture of medicine. Objective: To analyze medical language from 5 premier medical journals and investigate broader changes in the culture of clinical investigation during the last 40 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study using a data-driven analysis, 302 293 PubMed records were extracted from JAMA, The Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine, the BMJ, and New England Journal of Medicine from January 1, 1976, through December 31, 2015, to identify key trends in medical language. A frequency analysis was applied across the 40-year time frame in JAMA to assess the major trends in all publication types. Patient-centered language was analyzed in clinical trials in the flanking time periods (1976-1980 and 2011-2015) across the 5 journals. Data were analyzed from November 16, 2016, through November 9, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Increasing or decreasing frequency of words (monograms) and word pairs (bigrams) and the proportion of patient-centric words in journal article titles. Results: In JAMA, 50277 articles of all publication types were included. In the frequency analysis, the most increased terms were reflective of the language of epidemiological research. The bigram analysis revealed a decline in causal language (-2.42/100 000 words to -2.03/100000 words; false discovery rate [FDR], <0.01) and an increased description of patients in the plural form (6.92/100 000 words to 11.4/100000 words; FDR, <0.01). A trend to separate patient from disease was observed; for example, there was a decrease in describing a patient as a diabetic (-2.21/100000 words; FDR, <0.01) compared with a patient with diabetes. In the analysis of clinical trials in all 5 journals, 3125 titles were identified (range, 193-932 per journal). In 4 of the 5 journals, use of patient-centric keywords increased significantly (absolute increase, 18.9%-34.3%; P < .001 for 3 journals; P = .01 for 1 journal), with the New England Journal of Medicine as the exception. This finding reflects a change from shorter disease-centric titles to longer titles that describe patients with a disease. Conclusions and Relevance: Trends in medical language reflect the rise of evidence-based medicine, a shift in focus from individuals to populations, and a separation of patient and disease. Data-driven analysis of medical language provides a unique window into the changing landscape of medical culture.","Trends in the Use of Common Words and Patient-Centric Language in the Titles of Medical Journals, 1976-2015."
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of computer-assisted forms of cognitive-behavior therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) and examine the role of clinician support and other factors that might affect outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus from their beginnings to July 18, 2016. Keywords were ""randomized, controlled trials of computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy for depression"" and ""randomized, controlled trials of mobile apps for cognitive-behavior therapy of depression."" STUDY SELECTION: Of 223 studies identified in the search, 183 were excluded yielding a sample of 40 randomized, controlled investigations of computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy (CCBT) for depression. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted independently by two authors, and consensus was reached by discussion with a third author. RESULTS: The overall mean effect size for CCBT compared to control conditions was g = 0.502, a moderately large effect. Studies that provided support from a clinician or other person yielded significantly larger effects (g = 0.673) than studies in which no support was provided (g = 0.239). Completion rate and study setting also influenced outcomes. Lower mean effect sizes were observed in studies with lower completion rates and in studies conducted in primary care practices. CONCLUSIONS: CCBT with a modest amount of support from a clinician or other helping person was found to be efficacious with relatively large mean effect sizes on measures of depressive symptoms. Self-guided CCBT for depression was considerably less effective. Future research should focus on enhancing the implementation of CCBT, including evaluating the amount and type of support needed for effective delivery, methods to improve engagement with computer-assisted therapies, and ways to improve treatment outcome in primary care settings.",Computer-Assisted Cognitive-Behavior Therapy for Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
"Studies suggest that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit altered electrophysiological alpha to gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Preliminary reports with small samples report conflicting findings regarding the directionality of the alpha to gamma PAC alterations in ASD. The present study examined resting-state activity throughout the brain in a relatively large sample of 119 children with ASD and 47 typically developing (TD) children. Children with ASD demonstrated regionally specific abnormalities in alpha to low-gamma PAC, with increased alpha to low-gamma PAC for a central midline source and decreased PAC at lateral sources. Group differences in local gamma-band power did not account for the regional group differences in alpha to low-gamma PAC. Moreover, local alpha power did not significantly modulate alpha to low-gamma PAC estimates. Finally, PAC estimates were correlated with SRS indicating clinical relevance of the PAC metric. In conclusion, alpha to low-gamma PAC alterations in ASD demonstrate a heterogeneous spatial profile consistent with previous studies and were related to symptom severity.",Children with ASD demonstrate regionally specific altered resting-state phase-amplitude coupling.
"PNH is the most common clonal hematopoietic disorder arising in patients with aAA. PNH is caused by mutations in PIGA, a gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of GPI anchors, transmembrane glycolipids required for cell surface expression of many proteins. PNH clones likely arise as immune escape mechanisms in aAA by preventing CD1D-restricted T-cell recognition of GPI anchors and GPI-linked autoantigens. Though many patients with aAA treated with IST will develop subclinical PNH clones, only a subset will develop PNH disease, characterized by increased thrombosis, intravascular hemolysis, and potential for severe organ dysfunction. In contrast to IST, allogeneic HSCT for patients with aAA is thought to cure bone marrow aplasia and prevent hematopoietic clonal evolution to PNH. Herein, we present a phenomenon of host-derived PNH disease arising in a patient with aAA many years following MSD-BMT, highlighting the importance of monitoring for this clonal disease in aAA patients with stable mixed donor/recipient chimerism after HSCT. We also provide a literature review for similar occurrences of PNH arising after HSCT.",Development of hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria without graft loss following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acquired aplastic anemia.
"BACKGROUND: Identifying brain activity patterns that are associated with suicidal ideation (SI) may help to elucidate its pathogenesis and etiology. Suicide poses a significant public health problem, and SI is a risk factor for suicidal behavior. METHODS: Forty-one unmedicated adult participants in a major depressive episode (MDE), 26 with SI on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation and 15 without SI, underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Twenty-one healthy volunteers (HVs) were scanned for secondary analyses. Whole brain analysis of both amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and fractional ALFF was performed in MDE subjects to identify regions where activity was associated with SI. RESULTS: Subjects with SI had greater ALFF than those without SI in two clusters: one in the right hippocampus and one in the thalamus and caudate, bilaterally. Multi-voxel pattern analysis distinguished between those with and without SI. Post hoc analysis of the mean ALFF in the hippocampus cluster found it to be associated with a delayed recall on the Buschke memory task. Mean ALFF from the significant clusters was not associated with depression severity and did not differ between MDE and HV groups. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that SI is associated with altered resting-state brain activity. The pattern of elevated activity in the hippocampus may be related to how memories are processed.",Resting-state amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation is associated with suicidal ideation.
"Previous studies assumed a uniform relationship between heat and kidney stone presentations. Determining whether sex and other characteristics modify the temperature dependence of kidney stone presentations has implications for explaining differences in nephrolithiasis prevalence and improving projections of the effect of climate change on nephrolithiasis. We performed an aggregated case-crossover study among 132,597 children and adults who presented with nephrolithiasis to 68 emergency departments throughout South Carolina from 1997 to 2015. We used quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear models to estimate sex differences in the cumulative exposure and lagged response between maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures and emergent kidney stone presentations, aggregated at the ZIP-code level. We also explored interactions by age, race, payer, and climate. Compared to 10 degrees C, daily wet-bulb temperatures at the 99th percentile were associated with a greater increased relative risk (RR) of kidney stone presentations over 10 days for males (RR 1.73; 95% CI 1.56, 1.91) than for females (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.01, 1.32; interaction P < 0.001). The shape of the lagged response was similar for males and females, with the greatest risk estimated for the 2 days following high temperatures. There were weak differences by age, race, and climatic zone, and no differences by payer status. The estimated risk of presenting emergently with kidney stones within 10 days of high daily wet-bulb temperatures was substantially greater among men than women, and similar between patients with public and private insurance. These findings suggest that the higher risk among males may be due to sexually dimorphic physiologic responses rather than greater exposure to ambient temperatures.",Sex differences in the temperature dependence of kidney stone presentations: a population-based aggregated case-crossover study.
"Introduction: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children; however, the role of inflammation in its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Methods: To elucidate the role of interleukin (IL)-6 in renal anemia, we induced CKD by adenine diet in juvenile wild-type (WT) and IL-6 deficient (Il6KO) mice, and examined serum IL-6 and relevant parameters in children with CKD. Results: WT-CKD mice developed anemia despite increases in serum erythropoietin and displayed low serum iron and elevated serum IL-6. IL-6 deficiency resulted in a significant improvement of red blood cell count and hemoglobin in CKD mice. This effect was associated with improvement of hypoferremia by Il6 deletion, likely mediated by hepcidin. However, correction of hypoferremia by oral iron supplementation in WT-CKD mice did not fully replicate the protective effects of Il6 deletion, suggesting an additional iron-independent role for IL-6 in CKD-anemia. Indeed, Il6 deletion mitigated the severity of renal fibrosis and alleviated relative erythropoietin insufficiency in CKD mice. Cytokine profiling in a pediatric CKD cohort demonstrated that of 10 cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon-gamma), only IL-6 was significantly (inversely) associated with hemoglobin when adjusted for glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The association between IL-6 and hemoglobin in children with CKD remained significant after adjustment for CKD stage, iron therapy, and hepcidin. Discussion: IL-6 contributes to development of anemia in juvenile CKD, through mechanisms that include induction of hypoferremia, aggravation of renal fibrosis, and alteration of the erythropoietin axis. IL-6 appears to be a promising therapeutic target in the management of CKD-anemia.",Interleukin-6 Contributes to the Development of Anemia in Juvenile CKD.
"Low signal-to-noise ratios and limited imaging depths restrict the ability of optical-imaging modalities to detect and accurately quantify molecular emissions from tissue. Here, by using a scanning external X-ray beam from a clinical linear accelerator to induce Cherenkov excitation of luminescence in tissue, we demonstrate in vivo mapping of the oxygenation of tumours at depths of several millimetres, with submillimetre resolution and nanomolar sensitivity. This was achieved by scanning thin sheets of the X-ray beam orthogonally to the emission-detection plane, and by detecting the signal via a time-gated CCD camera synchronized to the radiation pulse. We also show with experiments using phantoms and with simulations that the performance of Cherenkov-excited luminescence scanned imaging (CELSI) is limited by beam size, scan geometry, probe concentration, radiation dose and tissue depth. CELSI might provide the highest sensitivity and resolution in the optical imaging of molecular tracers in vivo.",Maps of in vivo oxygen pressure with submillimetre resolution and nanomolar sensitivity enabled by Cherenkov-excited luminescence scanned imaging.
"The major hurdles currently preventing advance and innovation in thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS) assessment and treatment are the lack of standardizable objective diagnostic measurement techniques that describe the 3D thoraco-abdominal structures and the dynamics of respiration. Our goal is to develop, test, and evaluate a quantitative dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (QdMRI) methodology and a biomechanical understanding for deriving key quantitative parameters from free-tidal-breathing dMRI image data for describing the 3D structure and dynamics of the thoraco-abdominal organs of TIS patients. In this paper, we propose an idea of a shape sketch to codify and then quantify the overall thoracic architecture, which involves the selection of 3D landmark points and computation of 3D dynamic distances over a respiratory cycle. We perform two statistical analyses of distance sketches on 25 different TIS patients to try to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms in relation to spine deformity and to quantitatively evaluate improvements from pre-operative to post-operative states. This QdMRI methodology involves developing: (1) a 4D image construction method; (2) an algorithm for the 4D segmentation of thoraco-abdominal structures; and (3) a set of key quantitative parameters. We illustrate that the TIS dynamic distance analysis method produces results previously unknown and precisely describes the morphologic and dynamic alterations of the thorax in TIS. A set of 3D thoraco-abdominal distances and/or distance differences enables the precise estimation of key measures such as left & right differences, differences over tidal breathing, and differences from pre- to post-operative condition.",Architectural Analysis on Dynamic MRI to Study Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome.
"Failure to predict and understand the causes of preterm birth, the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, have limited effective interventions and therapeutics. From a cohort of 2000 pregnant women, we performed a nested case control study on 107 well-phenotyped cases of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) and 432 women delivering at term. Using innovative Bayesian modeling of cervicovaginal microbiota, seven bacterial taxa were significantly associated with increased risk of sPTB, with a stronger effect in African American women. However, higher vaginal levels of beta-defensin-2 lowered the risk of sPTB associated with cervicovaginal microbiota in an ethnicity-dependent manner. Surprisingly, even in Lactobacillus spp. dominated cervicovaginal microbiota, low beta-defensin-2 was associated with increased risk of sPTB. These findings hold promise for diagnostics to accurately identify women at risk for sPTB early in pregnancy. Therapeutic strategies could include immune modulators and microbiome-based therapeutics to reduce this significant health burden.",Cervicovaginal microbiota and local immune response modulate the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery.
"RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is an essential enzyme responsible for the synthesis of several small non-coding RNAs, a number of which are involved in mRNA translation. Recessive mutations in POLR3A, encoding the largest subunit of Pol III, cause POLR3-related hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (POLR3-HLD), characterized by deficient central nervous system myelination. Identification of the downstream effectors of pathogenic POLR3A mutations has been so far elusive. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce the POLR3A mutation c.2554A>G (p.M852V) into human cell lines and assessed its impact on Pol III biogenesis, nuclear import, DNA occupancy, transcription, and protein levels. Transcriptomic profiling uncovered a subset of transcripts vulnerable to Pol III hypofunction, including a global reduction in tRNA levels. The brain cytoplasmic BC200 RNA (BCYRN1), involved in translation regulation, was consistently affected in all our cellular models, including patient-derived fibroblasts. Genomic BC200 deletion in an oligodendroglial cell line led to major transcriptomic and proteomic changes, having a larger impact than those of POLR3A mutations. Upon differentiation, mRNA levels of the MBP gene, encoding myelin basic protein, were significantly decreased in POLR3A-mutant cells. Our findings provide the first evidence for impaired Pol III transcription in cellular models of POLR3-HLD and identify several candidate effectors, including BC200 RNA, having a potential role in oligodendrocyte biology and involvement in the disease.",Leukodystrophy-associated POLR3A mutations down-regulate the RNA polymerase III transcript and important regulatory RNA BC200.
"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is an aggressive sarcoma with recurrent loss of function alterations in polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a histone-modifying complex involved in transcriptional silencing.To understand the role of PRC2 loss in pathogenesis and identify therapeutic targets, we conducted parallel global epigenomic and proteomic analysis of archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human MPNST with and without PRC2 loss (MPNSTLOSS vs. MPNSTRET). Loss of PRC2 resulted in increased histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) associated with active transcription, most notably H3K27Ac and H3K36me2, whereas repressive H3K27 di- and trimethylation (H3K27me2/3) marks were globally lost without a compensatory gain in other repressive PTMs. Instead, DNA methylation globally increased in MPNSTLOSS. Epigenomic changes were associated with upregulation of proteins in growth pathways and reduction in interferon signaling and antigen presentation, suggesting a role for epigenomic changes in tumor progression and immune evasion, respectively. These changes also resulted in therapeutic vulnerabilities. Knockdown of NSD2, the methyltransferase responsible for H3K36me2, restored MHC expression and induced interferon pathway expression in a manner similar to PRC2 restoration. MPNSTLOSS were also highly sensitive to DNA methyltransferase and HDAC inhibitors. Overall, these data suggest that global loss of PRC2-mediated repression renders MPNST differentially dependent on DNA methylation to maintain transcriptional integrity and makes them susceptible to therapeutics that promote aberrant transcription initiation.",Epigenomic reordering induced by Polycomb loss drives oncogenesis but leads to therapeutic vulnerabilities in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
"BACKGROUND: Heart transplant volume varies significantly among centers. We hypothesize that centers where the transplant team routinely accepts organs previously declined by other centers and where operating room availability is unrestricted will have higher transplant volumes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We utilized the potential transplant recipient sequence number in the United Network for Organ Sharing database as a surrogate for graft acceptance threshold and the number of transplants occurring on weekends and 8 major holidays as a marker of center resource availability. Centers were classified as low-, medium-, or high-volume if the average number of annual transplants were <10, between 10 and 30, or >30 over a 10-year period, respectively. Between 7/12/2006 and 12/31/2015, 19,054 transplants were performed by 142 centers. There were 59 low-volume centers, 69 medium-volume centers, and 14 high-volume centers with median potential transplant recipient sequence number for transplanted candidates of 7 (IQR 3-11), 7 (5-10), and 15 (7-40), respectively (p=.002). The median proportion of off-hours transplants performed by medium volume centers was 28% (25-31%) compared to 32% (29-33%) by high volume centers (p=.009). Five-year survival was equivalent among all centers (p=.053).",Transplant Volume is Associated with Graft Acceptance Threshold and Center Resource Availability.
"There is scant literature describing the effect of glomerular disease on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The Cure Glomerulonephropathy study (CureGN) is an international longitudinal cohort study of children and adults with four primary glomerular diseases (minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and IgA nephropathy). HRQOL is systematically assessed using items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Informative System (PROMIS). We assessed the relationship between HRQOL and demographic and clinical variables in 478 children and 1115 adults at the time of enrollment into CureGN. Domains measured by PROMIS items included global assessments of health, mobility, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep impairment, as well as a derived composite measure incorporating all measured domains. Multivariable models were created that explained 7 to 32% of variance in HRQOL. Patient-reported edema consistently had the strongest and most robust association with each measured domain of HRQOL in multivariable analysis (adjusted beta [95% CI] for composite PROMIS score in children, -5.2 [-7.1 to -3.4]; for composite PROMIS score in adults, -6.1 [-7.4 to -4.9]). Female sex, weight (particularly obesity), and estimated glomerular filtration rate were also associated with some, but not all, domains of HRQOL. Primary diagnosis, disease duration, and exposure to immunosuppression were not associated with HRQOL after adjustment. Sensitivity analyses and interaction testing demonstrated no significant association between disease duration or immunosuppression and any measured domain of HRQOL. Thus, patient-reported edema has a consistent negative association with HRQOL in patients with primary glomerular diseases, with substantially greater impact than other demographic and clinical variables.",Health-related quality of life in glomerular disease.
"OBJECTIVES: This study hypothesized that paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) reflects the presence of a more severe cardiac hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) phenotype. BACKGROUND: HCM is characterized by myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and a high prevalence of PAF. It is currently unresolved whether atrial fibrillation (AF) is a marker or a mediator of adverse outcomes in HCM. METHODS: This study retrospectively examined 45 HCM patients who underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in sinus rhythm. The function of all 4 cardiac chambers was assessed, as well as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV), as indicators of fibrosis. A fat-saturated, 3-dimensional inversion recovery-prepared, fast-spoiled, gradient-recalled echo sequence, and the image intensity ratio method were used to measure LA-LGE; LGE in the LV was quantified using a semi-automated threshold technique. RESULTS: HCM patients (n = 45) were divided into 2 groups (PAF, no AF) based on history of PAF. All HCM patients had LGE in the LA posterior wall. The PAF group (n = 18) had higher LA volume, a lower LA ejection fraction, a lower global peak longitudinal LA strain (PLAS), and a higher amount of LA-LGE compared with the no AF group (n = 27). A modest inverse association was noted between the LA ejection fraction, PLAS, and LA-LGE; a positive association was present between LV-LGE and LA-LGE. The PAF group had lower ejection fractions in the LV, right atrium, and right ventricle compared with those in the no AF group. CONCLUSIONS: PAF is associated with a greater degree of structural LA remodeling and global myopathy, which suggests a more severe cardiac HCM phenotype.",Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Patients With Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Have a High Burden of Left Atrial Fibrosis by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the natural history of chronic pancreatitis (CP); patients in the North American Pancreatitis Study2 (NAPS2, adults) and INternational Study group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a cuRE (INSPPIRE, pediatric) were compared. METHODS: Demographics, risk factors, disease duration, management and outcomes of 224 children and 1063 adults were compared using appropriate statistical tests for categorical and continuous variables. RESULTS: Alcohol was a risk in 53% of adults and 1% of children (P < 0.0001); tobacco in 50% of adults and 7% of children (P < 0.0001). Obstructive factors were more common in children (29% vs 19% in adults, P = 0.001). Genetic risk factors were found more often in children. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was similar (children 26% vs adult 33%, P = 0.107). Diabetes was more common in adults than children (36% vs 4% respectively, P < 0.0001). Median emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and missed days of work/school were similar across the cohorts. As a secondary analysis, NAPS2 subjects with childhood onset (NAPS2-CO) were compared with INSPPIRE subjects. These 2 cohorts were more similar than the total INSPPIRE and NAPS2 cohorts, including for genetic risk factors. The only risk factor significantly more common in the NAPS2-CO cohort compared with the INSPPIRE cohort was alcohol (9% NAPS2-CO vs 1% INSPPIRE cohorts, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Despite disparity in age of onset, children and adults with CP exhibit similarity in demographics, CP treatment, and pain. Differences between groups in radiographic findings and diabetes prevalence may be related to differences in risk factors associated with disease and length of time of CP.",Chronic Pancreatitis: Pediatric and Adult Cohorts Show Similarities in Disease Progress Despite Different Risk Factors.
"We examined whether hospitals participating in Medicare's Shared Saving Program increased the use of highly rated skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) or decreased the use of low-rated SNFs hospital-wide after initiation of their accountable care organization (ACO) contracts compared with non-ACO hospitals. Using a difference-in-differences design, we estimated the change in the probability of discharge to 5-star and 1-star SNFs among all beneficiaries discharged from ACO-participating hospitals after the hospital initiated ACO participation. After joining an ACO, the percentage of hospital discharges going to a high-quality SNF increased by 3.4 percentage points on a base of 15.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-5.5, P = .002) compared with non-ACO-participating hospitals. The probability of discharge from an ACO-participating hospital to low-quality SNFs did not change significantly compared with non-ACO-participating hospitals. Our findings indicate that ACO-participating hospitals were more likely to discharge patients to highly rated SNFs after they began their ACO contract but did not change the likelihood of discharge to lower rated SNFs in comparison with non-ACO hospitals.",Do Hospitals Participating in Accountable Care Organizations Discharge Patients to Higher Quality Nursing Homes?
"OBJECTIVES: To illustrate the effects that minor social or environmental disruptions could have on the food access of low-income households in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and provide suggestions for how cities can better incorporate food into emergency planning. METHODS: Using publicly available data and stakeholder interviews (n = 8) in 2017, we projected the number of meals that would be missed during environmental and social disruptions in Philadelphia, a major US city with a high poverty rate. RESULTS: As our projections in Philadelphia indicate, even just 3 days of school closures could result in as many as 405 600 missed meals for school-aged children. CONCLUSIONS: These scenarios provide valuable lessons for other cities to proactively plan for food access continuity in times of uncertainty. Public Health Implications. City planners and other city agencies need to include food as a routine part of emergency planning and redefine the threshold at which emergency response protocols are triggered to better ensure protection of low-income and underserved populations.

"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of metopic craniosynostosis often involves bitemporal expansion of the anterior cranium. This report compares perioperative variables of a surgical technique in which the fronto-orbital bandeau is bent in situ to traditional fronto-orbital advancement and remodeling (FOAR). METHOD/DESCRIPTION: Six patients undergoing the hinge technique were compared to the senior author's 6 most recent conventional FOARs. Study and control cohorts were reasonably well matched for age and sex; only those with nonsyndromic, single-suture metopic synostosis were included. Perioperative variables such as OR time, blood loss, hardware costs, length of stay, and perioperative complications were compared between groups using unpaired t tests. RESULTS: Operative time was significantly decreased when the hinge technique was utilized, with a mean operative time of 159 +/- 14.0 minutes for hinge patients and 193 +/- 33.8 minutes for nonhinge patients (P = 0.049). Hardware was also significantly decreased from an average of 2.2 +/- 1.0 plates and 35 +/- 13.8 screws in nonhinge patients to 1 plate and 20 screws in each hinge patient (P < 0.02), for an average hardware saving of $2990 per hinge surgery (P = 0.019). Estimated blood loss, length of stay, and perioperative complications were not significantly different between groups. All patients in both groups had Whitaker 1 outcomes in short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The hinge technique for the treatment of metopic synostosis is associated with a statistically significant decrease in operative time, hardware utilization, and hardware cost. Perioperative outcomes were similar between the hinge technique and traditional FOAR in the short term, and additional follow-up is needed to determine whether the 2 have similar long-term outcomes.",In Situ Hinge Technique for the Frontal Bandeau for the Correction of Metopic Craniosynostosis Reduces Operative Time.
"Genetic predictions of height differ among human populations and these differences have been interpreted as evidence of polygenic adaptation. These differences were first detected using SNPs genome-wide significantly associated with height, and shown to grow stronger when large numbers of sub-significant SNPs were included, leading to excitement about the prospect of analyzing large fractions of the genome to detect polygenic adaptation for multiple traits. Previous studies of height have been based on SNP effect size measurements in the GIANT Consortium meta-analysis. Here we repeat the analyses in the UK Biobank, a much more homogeneously designed study. We show that polygenic adaptation signals based on large numbers of SNPs below genome-wide significance are extremely sensitive to biases due to uncorrected population stratification. More generally, our results imply that typical constructions of polygenic scores are sensitive to population stratification and that population-level differences should be interpreted with caution. Editorial note: This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter).",Polygenic adaptation on height is overestimated due to uncorrected stratification in genome-wide association studies.
"AIM: To provide multilayered combination therapies encompassing nanoparticles and organic peptides and to assess their efficacy in the treatment of arthritis. MATERIALS & METHODS: Fish oil protein (FP) was isolated from fish oil glands and tagged with spherical gold nanoparticles (GNPs). Tagged GNPs were encapsulated in DPPC liposomes (FP-GNP-DPPC) and characterized. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: FP increased the hydrophilicity of GNP, while encapsulation of FP-GNP within liposomes increased the hydrophobicity. In vitro release studies of FP-GNP-DPPC exhibited sustained release of FP in simulated synovial fluid. FP-GNP-DPPC injected into intra-articular joints of rats displayed anti-osteoarthritic effects in osteoarthritic rat model. This is the first study to report the anti-osteoarthritic activity of FP and DPPC encapsulated FP-GNP liposomes.",Liposome-encapsulated fish oil protein-tagged gold nanoparticles for intra-articular therapy in osteoarthritis.

"OBJECTIVE: Hydrocephalus is a common presenting symptom of pediatric posterior fossa tumors and often requires permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion even after resection. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is a well-established treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus in children. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that ETV prior to posterior fossa tumor resection decreases the rate of postoperative ventriculoperitonal shunt (VPS) placement. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who presented with hydrocephalus and underwent posterior fossa tumor resection between 2005 and 2016 excluding pineal and tectal tumors. The rate of postoperative VPS placement was compared in patients who underwent resection and had a VPS placed perioperatively (historical controls) with patients who underwent ETV prior to resection. The two groups were matched for demographics, tumor histology, and tumor location. We also performed a literature review of prior studies that examined the role of ETV in pediatric posterior fossa tumors. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients in the control group were compared to 38 patients in our study. The patients were matched across all variables (age, gender, tumor histology, and tumor locations). The rate of postoperative VPS placement was 31% in the control group compared to 16% in the ETV group. No complications were encountered during ETV. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy prior to posterior fossa tumor resection in children appears to decrease the rate of postoperative VPS placement. Given its efficacy and safety, ETV should be considered prior to tumor resection in these patients.",Endoscopic third ventriculostomy prior to resection of posterior fossa tumors in children.
"PURPOSE: A number of institutions have clinically implemented CYP2D6 genotyping to guide drug prescribing. We compared implementation strategies of early adopters of CYP2D6 testing, barriers faced by both early adopters and institutions in the process of implementing CYP2D6 testing, and approaches taken to overcome these barriers. METHODS: We surveyed eight early adopters of CYP2D6 genotyping and eight institutions in the process of adoption. Data were collected on testing approaches, return of results procedures, applications of genotype results, challenges faced, and lessons learned. RESULTS: Among early adopters, CYP2D6 testing was most commonly ordered to assist with opioid and antidepressant prescribing. Key differences among programs included test ordering and genotyping approaches, result reporting, and clinical decision support. However, all sites tested for copy-number variation and nine common variants, and reported results in the medical record. Most sites provided automatic consultation and had designated personnel to assist with genotype-informed therapy recommendations. Primary challenges were related to stakeholder support, CYP2D6 gene complexity, phenotype assignment, and sustainability. CONCLUSION: There are specific challenges unique to CYP2D6 testing given the complexity of the gene and its relevance to multiple medications. Consensus lessons learned may guide those interested in pursuing similar clinical pharmacogenetic programs.",Multi-site investigation of strategies for the clinical implementation of CYP2D6 genotyping to guide drug prescribing.
"BACKGROUND: Identifying genetic variants with pleiotropic associations across multiple cancers can reveal shared biologic pathways. Prior pleiotropic studies have primarily focused on European descent individuals. Yet population-specific genetic variation can occur and potential pleiotropic associations among diverse racial/ethnic populations could be missed. We examined cross-cancer pleiotropic associations with lung cancer risk in African Americans. METHODS: We conducted a pleiotropic analysis among 1,410 African American lung cancer cases and 2,843 controls. We examined 36,958 variants previously associated (or in linkage disequilibrium) with cancer in prior genome-wide association studies. Logistic regression analyses were conducted, adjusting for age, sex, global ancestry, study site, and smoking status. RESULTS: We identified three novel genomic regions significantly associated (FDR-corrected p-value < 0.10) with lung cancer risk (rs336958 on 5q14.3, rs7186207 on 16q22.2, and rs11658063 on 17q12). On chromosome16q22.2, rs7186207 was significantly associated with reduced risk (OR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.73-0.89) and functional annotation using GTEx showed rs7186207 modifies DHODH gene expression. The minor allele at rs336958 on 5q14.3 was associated with increased lung cancer risk (OR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.22-1.78), while the minor allele at rs11658063 on 17q12 was associated with reduced risk (OR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.72-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel associations on chromosomes 5q14.3, 16q22.2, and 17q12, which contain HNF1B, DHODH, and HAPLN1 genes, respectively. SNPs within these regions have been previously associated with multiple cancers. This is the first study to examine cross-cancer pleiotropic associations for lung cancer in African Americans. IMPACT: Our findings demonstrate novel cross-cancer pleiotropic associations with lung cancer risk in African Americans.",Cross-cancer pleiotropic associations with lung cancer risk in African Americans.
"BACKGROUND: Persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity in infants affected by congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Since the structural changes that lead to PPH take place already in utero, a treatment starting in the prenatal phase may prevent the occurrence of this complication. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the development process of antenatal sildenafil for CDH. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics and efficacy of sildenafil have been assessed in the rat and the rabbit model. The transfer of the drug through the human placenta has been measured with the ex-vivo placenta perfusion model. Results from this experiment are being incorporated in a pregnancy-physiologically based pharmacokinetic (p-PBPK) model. A phase I-IIb placental transfer and safety study is ongoing. RESULTS: Sildenafil administration to pregnant rats and rabbits led to therapeutic foetal drug levels without maternal and foetal toxicity, although it was associated with impaired vascular development in foetuses with non-hypoplastic lungs. Peak concentrations and 24-hour exposure were higher in pregnant rabbits compared to non-pregnant ones. In rat and rabbit foetuses with CDH, sildenafil rescued the lung vascular anomalies and partially improved parenchymal development. Sildenafil crossed the human placenta at a high rate ex-vivo, independently from the initial maternal concentration. CONCLUSION: There is preclinical evidence that maternally administered sildenafil prevents the vascular changes that lead to PPH in CDH newborns. The phase I/IIb clinical study together with the p-PBPK model will define the maternal dose needed for a therapeutic effect in the foetus. Foetal safety will be investigated both in the clinical study and in the sheep. The final step will be a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.",Sildenafil for Antenatal Treatment of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia: from Bench to Bedside.
"Appropriate energy intake is important for the health and performance of athletes. When an athlete's energy intake is not concordant with energy expenditure, short- and long-term performance can be compromised and negative health effects may arise. The energy intake patterns of athletes are subject to numerous effectors, including exercise response, time, and availability of food. To assess different determinants of energy intake in athletes, we reviewed recent literature regarding the response of appetite-regulating hormones to exercise, appetite perceptions following exercise, chronic exercise-induced adaptations regarding appetite, and social factors regarding energy intake. Additionally, we discussed consequences of aberrant energy intake. The purpose of this review is to clarify understanding about energy intake in athletes and provide insights into methods toward maintaining proper energy intake.","Measurement, Determinants, and Implications of Energy Intake in Athletes."
"Commissural axons initially respond to attractive signals at the midline, but once they cross, they become sensitive to repulsive cues. This switch prevents axons from re-entering the midline. In insects and mammals, negative regulation of Roundabout (Robo) receptors prevents premature response to the midline repellant Slit. In Drosophila, the endosomal protein Commissureless (Comm) prevents Robo1 surface expression before midline crossing by diverting Robo1 into late endosomes. Notably, Comm is not conserved in vertebrates. We identified two Nedd-4-interacting proteins, Ndfip1 and Ndfip2, that act analogously to Comm to localize Robo1 to endosomes. Ndfip proteins recruit Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases to promote Robo1 ubiquitylation and degradation. Ndfip proteins are expressed in commissural axons in the developing spinal cord and removal of Ndfip proteins results in increased Robo1 expression and reduced midline crossing. Our results define a conserved Robo1 intracellular sorting mechanism between flies and mammals to avoid premature responsiveness to Slit.",Ndfip Proteins Target Robo Receptors for Degradation and Allow Commissural Axons to Cross the Midline in the Developing Spinal Cord.
"This study aimed to identify the differentiating parameters of the spinal curves' 2D projections through a hierarchical classification of the 3D spinal curve in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). A total number of 103 right thoracic left lumbar pre-operative AIS patients were included retrospectively and consecutively. A total number of 20 non-scoliotic adolescents were included as the control group. All patients had biplanar X-rays and 3D reconstructions of the spine. The 3D spinal curve was calculated by interpolating the center of vertebrae and was isotropically normalized. A hierarchical classification of the normalized spinal curves was developed to group the patients based on the similarity of their 3D spinal curve. The spinal curves' 2D projections and clinical spinal measurements in the three anatomical planes were then statistically compared between these groups and between the scoliotic subtypes and the non-scoliotic controls. A total of 5 patient groups of right thoracic left lumbar AIS patients were identified. The characteristics of the posterior-anterior and sagittal views of the spines were: Type 1: Normal sagittal profile and S shape axial view. T1 is leveled or tilted to the right in the posterior view. Type 2: Hypokyphotic and a V shape axial view. T1 is tilted to the left in the posterior view. Type 3: Hypokyphotic (only T5-T10) and frontal imbalance, S shape axial view. T1 is leveled or tilted to the right, and 3 frontal curves. Type 4: Flat sagittal profile (T1-L2), slight frontal imbalance with a V shape axial view, T1 tilted to the left. Type 5: flat sagittal profile and forward trunk shift with a proximal kyphosis and S shape axial view. T1 is leveled or tilted to the right. In conclusion, a hierarchical classification of the 3D scoliotic spine allowed identifying various distinguishing features of the spinal curves in patients with a right thoracic curve in an orderly fashion. The subtypes' characteristics resulting from this 3D classification can be identified from the pairs of the frontal and sagittal spinal curves i.e. X-rays in right thoracic AIS patients.",A hierarchical classification of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: Identifying the distinguishing features in 3D spinal deformities.
"BACKGROUND: At academic medical centers, residents and fellows play an integral role as surgical first assistants in spinal deformity surgery. However, limited data exist on whether the experience level of the surgical assistant affects outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, multisurgeon study comparing perioperative and postoperative outcomes after adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) surgery for the same 11 surgeons who performed cases that were assisted by residents compared with cases that were assisted by fellows. Blood loss, operative time, duration of hospitalization, complication rates, Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 questionnaire scores, and radiographic outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: We evaluated outcomes for 347 surgical procedures; 118 cases were assisted by residents and 229 were assisted by fellows. Preoperative radiographic and demographic parameters were not different between the groups. The resident group had significantly more estimated blood loss than the fellow group (939 compared with 762 mL, p = 0.02). Otherwise, the perioperative characteristics were similar between the groups, including the volume of the autologous blood recovery system product that was transfused, the operative time, and the occurrence of intraoperative neuromonitoring changes. Postoperatively, the percentage correction of the Cobb angle, the number of levels that had been fused, the number of days until the discharge criteria had been met, and the rate of major complications were similar between the groups. At the 2-year follow-up, the overall and subdomain SRS-22 questionnaire scores were not different between the groups, except that patients in the resident-assisted group had slightly worse pain scores than those in the fellow-assisted group (4.3 compared with 4.5, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The first assistant's level of training did not affect clinical or radiographic outcomes following AIS surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to understand the prevalence of alcohol and other substance use among teenagers in generalized samples. METHODS: This study compared the alcohol and other substance use of adolescents enrolled in a screening study across 16 Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network emergency departments (EDs) (ASSESS) with those sampled in 2 nationally representative surveys, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) and the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The analysis includes 3362 ASSESS participants and 11,142 YRBSS and 12,086 NSDUH respondents. RESULTS: The ASSESS patients had a similar profile to the NSDUH sample, with small differences in marijuana and cocaine use and age at first tobacco smoking and smoking within the last 30 days and higher use of snuff or chewing tobacco. The YRBSS participants had higher rates of using marijuana, snuff/chewing tobacco, methamphetamine, and hallucinogens and higher smoking rates compared with ASSESS and NSDUH. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents visiting Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network EDs have substantial rates of substance use, similar to other nationally representative studies on this topic, although not as high as a school-based survey. Future ED studies should continue to investigate adolescent substance use, including exploring optimal methods of survey administration.",Adolescent Substance Abuse Risk: A Comparison of Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Emergency Department Patients and 2 Nationally Representative Samples.
"BACKGROUND: A unified vision of team mission, psychologically safe practice environment, effective communication, and respect among team members are key characteristics of an effective interdisciplinary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) team. PURPOSE: A quality improvement team in a quaternary NICU surveyed parents, physicians, and nurses on perceptions of teamwork to identify opportunities for improvement. DESIGN/METHODS: Parents and healthcare staff (n = 113) completed an anonymous survey from May to July of 2014 to assess team roles and membership, team qualities, shared mission, psychological safety, hierarchy, communications, and conflict awareness. An expert panel assigned questions into one or more characteristics of team intelligence. RESULTS: Physicians, nurses, and parents perceive their roles and the composition of the healthcare team differently. Most providers reported a shared mission and having a cooperative spirit as their teams' best attributes. While most nurses chose safety as most important, the majority of doctors chose treatment plan. Parents consider tenderness toward their infant, providing medical care and answers to their questions important. All expressed varying concerns about psychological safety, conflict resolution, and miscommunications. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This survey identifies strengths and gaps of teamwork in our NICU and provides insight on necessary changes that need to be made to improve collaboration among the interdisciplinary care team including parents. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: This quality improvement report identifies aspects of team care delivery in NICUs that require further study. The concept of team intelligence and its impact on team effectiveness invites in-depth exploration.",Evaluating Teamwork in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: A Survey of Providers and Parents.
"Filopodia are actin-filled membrane protrusions that play essential roles in cell motility, cell-cell communication, and act as precursors of dendritic spines. IRSp53 is an essential regulator of filopodia formation, which couples Rho-GTPase signaling to actin cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling. IRSp53 has three major domains: an N-terminal inverse-BAR (I-BAR) domain, a Cdc42- and SH3-binding CRIB-PR domain, and an SH3 domain that binds downstream cytoskeletal effectors. Phosphorylation sites in the region between the CRIB-PR and SH3 domains mediate the binding of 14-3-3. Yet, the mechanism by which 14-3-3 regulates filopodia formation and dynamics and its role in cell migration are poorly understood. Here, we show that phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of IRSp53 by 14-3-3 counters activation by Cdc42 and cytoskeletal effectors, resulting in downregulation of filopodia dynamics and cancer cell migration. In serum-starved cells, increased IRSp53 phosphorylation triggers 14-3-3 binding, which inhibits filopodia formation and dynamics, irrespective of whether IRSp53 is activated by Cdc42 or downstream effectors (Eps8, Ena/VASP). Pharmacological activation or inhibition of AMPK respectively increases or decreases the phosphorylation of two out of three sites in IRSp53 implicated in 14-3-3 binding. Mutating these phosphorylation sites reverses 14-3-3-dependent inhibition of filopodia dynamics and cancer cell chemotaxis.

"Mobile laboratories provide diagnostic capabilities for routine surveillance and patient identification during an outbreak. In either situation they face many challenges including identification of the appropriate assay(s) to employ, logistical arrangements, and providing for the health and safety of the laboratory staff. Great strides have been made over the last decade in the development of mobile laboratories with assays that require minimal infrastructure and technical experience. This knowledge and expertise has been developed in partnership with many researchers and public health officials who live in regions prone to infectious disease outbreaks. Mobile laboratories should now also be used in the evaluation of novel vaccines and therapeutics in remote locations. Clinical mobile laboratories will include similar diagnostic capabilities as outbreak response mobile labs, but will also include additional point-of-care instruments operated under Good Clinical Practice guidelines. They will also operate rigorous data management plans so that the data collected will satisfy regulatory agencies during the licensure process. Failure to deploy an adequate clinical mobile laboratory when administering a novel biological product in a remote location is a significant limitation to any collected scientific data that could ultimately undermine clinical development and availability of life-saving interventions.",Challenges and perspectives on the use of mobile laboratories during outbreaks and their use for vaccine evaluation.
"BACKGROUND: Solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) are rare epithelial cells enriched in nasal polyps and are the primary source of interleukin-25 (IL-25), an innate cytokine eliciting T-helper 2 (Th2) immune response. Although it is proposed that SCCs are stimulated by antigens released by upper airway pathogens, the exogenous triggers of human SCCs remain elusive. We studied patients with noninvasive fungal rhinosinusitis to determine whether extracts of Aspergillus fumigatus and Alternaria alternata stimulate SCC proliferation as an early event in type 2 inflammation. METHODS: Multicolor flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunoassay were used to interrogate mucosa from patients with mycetomas and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) for SCCs and IL-25. Primary sinonasal epithelial cells from AFRS patients and noninflamed inferior turbinates were stimulated with fungal extracts for 72 hours, and SCC population frequency as well as mitotic activity were quantified using flow cytometry. RESULTS: SCCs producing IL-25 are enriched in inflamed mucosa compared with intrapatient noninflamed control tissue (38.6% vs 6.5%, p = 0.029). In cultured sinonasal epithelial cells from AFRS nasal polyps, Aspergillus fumigatus and Alternaria alternata stimulated higher SCC frequency compared with controls (27.4% vs 10.6%, p = 0.002; 18.1% vs 10.6%, p = 0.046), which led to increased IL-25 secretion in culture media (75.5 vs 3.3 pg/mL, p < 0.001; 32.3 vs 3.3 pg/mL, p = 0.007). Ki-67 expression was higher in SCCs grown in fungal stimulation conditions compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Although fungal antigens are known to potentiate immune response through innate cytokines, including IL-25, the early expansion of SCCs in the presence of fungus has not been described. This early event in the pathogenesis of noninvasive fungal rhinosinusitis may represent a target for intervention.",Fungal extracts stimulate solitary chemosensory cell expansion in noninvasive fungal rhinosinusitis.
"CREBBP loss-of function variants cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS). There have been two separate reports of patients with missense variants in exon 30 or 31 of CREBBP in individuals lacking the characteristic facial and limb dysmorphism associated with RTS. Frequent features in this condition include variable intellectual disability, short stature, autistic behavior, microcephaly, feeding problems, epilepsy, recurrent upper airway infections, and mild hearing impairment. We report three further patients with de novo exon 31 CREBBP missense variants. The first individual has a c.5357G>A p. (Arg1786His) variant affecting the same codon as one of the previously described patients. Both these patients could be recognized by clinicians as mild RTS. Our second patient has a c.5602C>T p.(Arg1868Trp) variant that has been described in five other individuals who all share a strikingly similar phenotype. The third individual has a novel c.5354G>A p.(Cys1785Try) variant. Our reports expand the clinical spectrum to include ventriculomegaly, absent corpus callosum, staphyloma, cochlear malformations, and exomphalos. These additional cases also help to establish genotype-phenotype correlations in this disorder. After the first and last authors of the previous two reports, we propose to call this disorder ""Menke-Hennekam syndrome"" to establish it as a clinical entity distinct from RTS and to provide a satisfactory name for adoption by parents and professionals, thus facilitating appropriate clinical management and research.",Genotype-phenotype specificity in Menke-Hennekam syndrome caused by missense variants in exon 30 or 31 of CREBBP.
"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Better disease activity and quality of life have been observed among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who drink alcohol. This association might be explained by reverse causality. We identified predictors of changes in alcohol use and evaluated independent associations between alcohol use and RA activity and mortality. METHODS: Participants in Forward, The National Databank for Rheumatic Diseases, were asked about alcohol use (any v. none), and disease activity was collected through the Patient Activity Scale-II (PAS-II) on semi-annual surveys. We identified factors associated with changes in alcohol use and determined associations between alcohol use and disease activity and mortality using linear and logistic regression models, Cox proportional hazards models, and marginal structural models. RESULTS: A total of 121,280 observations were studied among 16,762 unique participants. Discontinuation and initiation of alcohol were common among drinkers and abstainers (8.2% and 8.4% of observations, respectively). Greater discontinuation and less initiation were observed with greater disease activity, older age, female sex, non-white race, obesity, greater comorbidity, low quality of life, low educational level, low income, and work disability. While alcohol users had lower PAS-II [beta: -0.15 (-0.18,-0.11) p<0.001], and a lower mortality [OR 0.87 (0.76,0.98) p=0.03] in traditional models, associations were not seen in marginal structural models. CONCLUSIONS: Higher disease activity, disability, comorbidity, and poor quality of life contribute to reductions in alcohol use. Active use and changes in use were not associated with disease activity or mortality when adjusting for confounding, suggesting no clear benefit of alcohol consumption in RA.

"Osteoporosis is a devastating disease with an essential genetic component. GWAS have discovered genetic signals robustly associated with bone mineral density (BMD), but not the precise localization of effector genes. Here, we carry out physical and direct variant to gene mapping in human mesenchymal progenitor cell-derived osteoblasts employing a massively parallel, high resolution Capture C based method in order to simultaneously characterize the genome-wide interactions of all human promoters. By intersecting our Capture C and ATAC-seq data, we observe consistent contacts between candidate causal variants and putative target gene promoters in open chromatin for ~ 17% of the 273 BMD loci investigated. Knockdown of two novel implicated genes, ING3 at 'CPED1-WNT16' and EPDR1 at 'STARD3NL', inhibits osteoblastogenesis, while promoting adipogenesis. This approach therefore aids target discovery in osteoporosis, here on the example of two relevant genes involved in the fate determination of mesenchymal progenitors, and can be applied to other common genetic diseases.",Genome-scale Capture C promoter interactions implicate effector genes at GWAS loci for bone mineral density.
"To divide, Gram-negative bacterial cells must remodel cell wall at the division site. It remains debated, however, whether this cell wall remodeling alone can drive membrane constriction, or if a constrictive force from the tubulin homolog FtsZ is required. Previously, we constructed software (REMODELER 1) to simulate cell wall remodeling during growth. Here, we expanded this software to explore cell wall division (REMODELER 2). We found that simply organizing cell wall synthesis complexes at the midcell is not sufficient to cause invagination, even with the implementation of a make-before-break mechanism, in which new hoops of cell wall are made inside the existing hoops before bonds are cleaved. Division can occur, however, when a constrictive force brings the midcell into a compressed state before new hoops of relaxed cell wall are incorporated between existing hoops. Adding a make-before-break mechanism drives division with a smaller constrictive force sufficient to bring the midcell into a relaxed, but not necessarily compressed, state.",Simulations suggest a constrictive force is required for Gram-negative bacterial cell division.
"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates various fundamental cellular processes, and its constitutive activation is a common driver for cancer. Anti-EGFR therapies have shown benefit in cancer patients, yet drug resistance almost inevitably develops, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern EGFR activation. Here we report that CD317, a surface molecule with a unique topology, activated EGFR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by regulating its localization on the plasma membrane. CD317 was upregulated in HCC cells, promoting cell cycle progression and enhancing tumorigenic potential in a manner dependent on EGFR. Mechanistically, CD317 associated with lipid rafts and released EGFR from these ordered membrane domains, facilitating the activation of EGFR and the initiation of downstream signaling pathways including the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and JAK-STAT pathways. Moreover, in HCC mouse models and patient samples, upregulation of CD317 correlated with EGFR activation. These results reveal a previously unrecognized mode of regulation for EGFR and suggest CD317 as an alternative target for treating EGFR-driven malignancies.",CD317 activates EGFR by regulating its association with lipid rafts.

"Through our work in youth advocacy as, respectively, legal and public health professionals, we are all too aware of the high levels of health care fragmentation experienced during pregnancy and postpartum by poor, young mothers of color. Meredith Matone's research highlights the heightened risk of fragmentation for girls with histories of child welfare involvement. For example, she found that 66.7% of young mothers who had resided in out-of-home placements and who had taken antipsychotic medication prior to becoming pregnant failed to fill prescriptions for antipsychotics in their first postpartum year. Put another way, two-thirds of these vulnerable young mothers--a far higher proportion than young mothers without histories of child welfare involvement--were not getting the treatment that they needed to care for themselves and their children. The very real consequences of this phenomenon can be seen in the experiences of Jesse Krohn's clients, several of whom have their stories told here. Treatment discontinuity, particularly during the transition to parenthood, places mothers at risk for poor health outcomes and maladaptive parenting approaches; threatens the health and safety of infants; and triggers child welfare involvement. This article explores the negative consequences and root causes of treatment discontinuity, as well as particularized population vulnerabilities for treatment discontinuity including, as noted, involvement with child welfare. It will also provide public health and child welfare policy solutions for reducing treatment discontinuity and improving mental and physical health outcomes for new mothers and infants. The population of mothers at highest risk for postpartum treatment gaps is not small: more than 40% of Medicaid-financed births to young women aged 15 to 24 occurred in mothers who had a childhood relationship to the child welfare system. It is unacceptable to be aware of the pervasiveness of this problem, particularly among intersectionally vulnerable women, and not deploy a targeted and evidence-based preventative and remedial response.",Supporting Mothers with Mental Illness: Postpartum Mental Health Service Linkage as a Matter of Public Health and Child Welfare Policy.
"BACKGROUND: Tracheal intubation (TI) is one of the most important interventions for the stabilization of critically ill neonates. Competency in airway management is essential for neonatal fellows. No studies have assessed which educational models, techniques, or instructions are perceived by neonatal fellows as the most beneficial for achieving competency in TI. OBJECTIVES: This study identifies which factors are considered most helpful in achieving intubation competency. METHOD: This was a mixed-method study. Semi-structured phone interviews addressed training experience for neonatal intubation. Through qualitative analysis, common themes were identified. RedCap electronic surveys and procedure logs were used to assess procedural experience. RESULTS: Forty-two fellows from 5 programs completed phone interviews. Fellows recalled 6-10 intubation attempts before fellowship. Independent statements related to achieving intubation competency were analyzed and coded into 5 main themes (Procedure, Practice, Perceptual Environment, Personnel, and Preparation). A large proportion of the statements focused on the use of video laryngoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The themes identified by neonatal-perinatal medicine (NPM) fellows as being the most beneficial in achieving proficiency in neonatal TI are categorized as ""The 5 Ps."" Careful review of these themes may be utilized to develop validated curriculums that enhance the teaching of TI and optimize the achievement of TI competency among NPM fellows.",What Do NICU Fellows Identify as Important for Achieving Competency in Neonatal Intubation?
"OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal MRI protocol and sequences for liver and cardiac iron estimation in children. METHODS: We evaluated patients </=18years with cardiac and liver MRIs for iron content estimation. Liver T2 was determined by a third-party company. Cardiac and Liver T2* values were measured by an observer. Liver T2* values were calculated using the available liver parenchyma in the cardiac MRI. Linear correlations and Bland-Altman plots were run between liver T2 and T2*, cardiac T2* values; and liver T2* on dedicated cardiac and liver MRIs. RESULTS: 139 patients were included. Mean liver T2 and T2* values were 8.6+/-5.4ms and 4.5+/-4.1ms, respectively. A strong correlation between liver T2 and T2* values was observed (r=0.96, p<0.001) with a bias (+4.1ms). Mean cardiac bright- and dark-blood T2* values were 26.5+/-12.9ms and 27.2+/-11.9ms, respectively. Cardiac T2* values showed a strong correlation (r=0.81, p<0.001) with a low bias (-1.0ms). The mean liver T2* on liver and cardiac MRIs were 4.9+/-4.7ms and 4.6+/-3.9ms, respectively. A strong correlation between T2* values was observed (r=0.96, p<0.001) with a small bias (-0.2ms). CONCLUSION: MRI protocols for iron concentration in the liver and the heart can be simplified to avoid redundant information and reduce scan time. In most patients, a single breath-hold GRE sequence can be used to evaluate the iron concentration in both the liver and heart.",Protocol optimization for cardiac and liver iron content assessment using MRI: What sequence should I use?
"OBJECTIVES: Use of intensive care is increasing in the United States and may be associated with high financial burden on patients and their families near the end of life. Our objective was to estimate out-of-pocket costs in the last year of life for individuals who required intensive care in the months prior to death and examine how these costs vary by insurance coverage. DESIGN: Observational cohort study using seven waves of post-death interview data (2002-2014). PARTICIPANTS: Decedents (n = 2,909) who spent time in the ICU at some point between their last interview and death. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two-part models were used to estimate out-of-pocket costs for direct medical care and health-related services by type of care and insurance coverage. Decedents with only traditional Medicare fee-for-service coverage have the highest out-of-pocket spending in the last year of life, estimated at $12,668 (95% CI, $9,744-15,592), second to only the uninsured. Medicare Advantage and private insurance provide slightly more comprehensive coverage. Individuals who spend-down to Medicaid coverage have 4x the out-of-pocket spending as those continuously on Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS: Across all categories of insurance coverage, out-of-pocket spending in the last 12 months of life is high and represents a significant portion of assets for many patients requiring intensive care and their families. Medicare fee-for-service alone does not insulate individuals from the financial burden of high-intensity care, due to lack of an out-of-pocket maximum and a relatively high co-payment for hospitalizations. Medicaid plays an important role in the social safety net, providing the most complete hospital coverage of all the insurance groups, as well as significantly financing long-term care.",Health Insurance and Out-of-Pocket Costs in the Last Year of Life Among Decedents Utilizing the ICU.
"BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of displaced middle-third clavicular fractures in pediatric and adolescent patients remains controversial. Furthermore, risk factors for the failure of nonoperative treatment have not been clearly defined. Therefore, we designed a systematic review and critical analysis to assess appropriate Grades of Recommendation for evidence-based treatment of middle-third clavicular fractures in the pediatric and adolescent populations. METHODS: We performed a systematic review following a search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases that was conducted in May 2017. The search terms were clavicle, clavic*, and fracture. Our specific PubMed search was (""clavicle""[MeSH] OR clavic*) AND (""fracture""[MeSH] OR fracture*). The results were filtered for English language and subjects </=18 years of age. There was no chronological limit on the results. The results were then assessed for relevance via a stepwise approach by first screening titles, then abstracts, and, finally, full text. The levels of evidence were determined for studies that met the inclusion criteria. The findings were summarized, and Grades of Recommendation were assigned by consensus. RESULTS: Our search returned 3,615 studies. Of these, 215 were potentially relevant. Studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria were removed by consensus. One hundred and nineteen full-text articles were then assessed. Of these, 19 met the inclusion criteria. Overall, patients with both operative and nonoperative treatment of displaced middle-third clavicular fractures have good functional outcomes, with Grade-B supporting evidence. There is Grade-B evidence that operative treatment results in a high complication rate. Both plating and nailing have a high likelihood of requiring implant removal, with Grade-B evidence. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of both nonoperative and operative treatment on patient cosmesis following displaced fractures. There is Grade-B evidence that nonunions of pediatric clavicular fractures are exceptionally rare, regardless of treatment strategy. Nonoperatively treated displaced fractures have conflicting evidence regarding any adverse effect displacement may have on functional status. CONCLUSIONS: Existing literature does not clearly delineate appropriate indications for nonoperative care or relative indications for operative intervention. Further studies are needed to guide treatment and promote better informed consent. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",Operative Versus Nonoperative Treatment of Pediatric and Adolescent Clavicular Fractures: A Systematic Review and Critical Analysis.
"BACKGROUND: Choosing to breastfeed is a decision with far-reaching benefits; strengthened immune systems, all-encompassing nutrition, and fostering healthy attachment. For these and other reasons, some mothers are reluctant to wean their child due to a subsequent pregnancy. Mothers may breastfeed throughout their second pregnancy, give birth to their second child, and simultaneously breastfeed two children. This practice is known as tandem breastfeeding. PURPOSE: We explore the biological and emotional considerations of tandem breastfeeding and offer practical suggestions for nurses. METHODS: Three mothers who engaged in tandem breastfeeding were identified and interviewed. Interviews were face-to-face or over the phone. One researcher conducted all interviews using the same questions that served as the foundation and guidance for the discussion-based interview. The interviews lasted 40 to 60 minutes and were audio recorded to minimize recall issues during data analysis. RESULTS: Three mothers shared their tandem breastfeeding journeys, challenges faced, and overall perspectives. This was an opportunity for mothers to share feedback on how nurses provided education and care as well as suggestions for nursing care of future mothers who choose to tandem breastfeeding. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Through research and case-series interviews, we developed implications for nursing practice. Nurses must be informed and supportive of mothers' decisions to tandem breastfeed.",Women's Experiences with Tandem Breastfeeding.
"Background Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density categories assigned by interpreting radiologists often influence decisions surrounding supplemental breast cancer screening and risk assessment. The landscape of mammographic screening continuously evolves, and different mammographic screening modalities may result in different perception of density, reflected in different assignment of BI-RADS density categories. Purpose To investigate the effect of screening mammography modality on BI-RADS breast density assessments. Materials and Methods Data were retrospectively analyzed from 24 736 individual women (42.3% [10 455 of 24 736] white women, 57.7% [14 281 of 24 736] black women; mean age, 56.3 years; age range, 40.0-74.9 years) who underwent from one to seven mammographic screening examinations from September 2010 through February 2017 (60 766 examinations). Three screening modalities were used: digital mammography alone (8935 examinations); digital mammography with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT; 30 779 examinations); and synthetic mammography with DBT (21 052 examinations). Random-effects logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the likelihood of assignment to high versus low BI-RADS density category according to each modality, adjusted for ethnicity, age, body mass index (BMI), and radiologist. The interactions of modality with ethnicity and BMI on density categorization were also tested with the model. Results Women screened with DBT versus digital mammography alone had lower likelihood regarding categorization of high density breasts (digital mammography and DBT vs digital mammography: odds ratio, 0.69 [95% confidence interval: 0.61, 0.80], P < .001; synthetic mammography and DBT vs digital mammography: odds ratio, 0.43 [95% confidence interval: 0.37, 0.50], P < .001). Lower likelihood of high density was also observed at synthetic mammography and DBT compared with digital mammography and DBT (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval: 0.56, 0.69; P < .001). There were interactions of modality with ethnicity (P = .007) and BMI (P = .003) on breast density assessment, with greater differences in density categorization according to modality observed for black women than for white women and groups with higher BMI. Conclusion Breast density categorization may vary by screening mammographic modality, and this effect appears to vary by ethnicity and body mass index.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes the results of randomized controlled trials that have evaluated the efficacy of behavioral interventions for obesity in primary care settings. RECENT FINDINGS: Most studies have found that high-intensity behavioral counseling (providing 12 or more sessions per year, as defined by the US Preventative Services Task Force), when delivered in-person, by phone, or electronically, produced clinically meaningful weight loss (4 to 7 kg). Low- to moderate-intensity behavioral counseling and counseling that did not include behavioral strategies (e.g., motivational interviewing) produced modest losses of 1 to 2 kg. The addition of weight loss medication increased mean losses relative to behavioral treatment alone. Consistent with national guidelines, the largest weight losses were achieved with high-intensity counseling, either alone or in combination with obesity pharmacotherapy. Primary care providers can support their patients by inviting them to discuss their weight concerns and referring interested individuals to appropriate interventions.",Primary Care Interventions for Obesity: Review of the Evidence.
"BACKGROUND: A recent randomized controlled trial of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound (FUS) for essential tremor (ET) demonstrated safety and efficacy. Patients with ventricular shunts may be good candidates for FUS to minimize hardware-associated infections. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate feasibility of FUS in this subset of patients. METHODS: A 74-yr-old male with medically refractory ET, and a right-sided ventricular shunt for normal pressure hydrocephalus, underwent FUS to the right ventro-intermedius (VIM) nucleus. The VIM nucleus was directly targeted using deterministic tractography. Clinical outcomes were measured using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. RESULTS: Shunt components required 6% of the total ultrasound transducer elements to be shut off. Eight therapeutic sonications were delivered (maximum temperature, 64 degrees ), leading to a 90% improvement in hand tremor and a 100% improvement in functional disability at the 3-mo follow-up. No complications were noted. CONCLUSION: This is the first case of FUS thalamotomy in a patient with a shunt. Direct VIM targeting and achievement of therapeutic temperatures with acoustic energy is feasible in this subset of patients.",Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for Essential Tremor in the Setting of a Ventricular Shunt: Technical Report.
"BACKGROUND: Leukopenia is a frequent complication following kidney transplantation. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been used to accelerate white blood cell (WBC) count recovery; however, published experience in kidney transplantation is limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our kidney transplant recipients from January 2012 to September 2016 with a G-CSF order to evaluate leukopenia management (defined as WBC < 3000 cells/muL). RESULTS: Thirty-six recipients were included. On average, G-CSF treatment began at 98 +/- 38 days. At G-CSF initiation, mean WBC count was 1240 +/- 420 cells/muL and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 653 +/- 368 cells/muL. Mean G-CSF dose was 4.6 +/- 1.2 mcg/kg/dose (total 11.8 +/- 9.0 mcg/kg), 77.8% of recipients were prescribed G-CSF as outpatients, and overall, median time to WBC count recovery was 9 (IQR 4-14) days. Changes in immunosuppression and prophylaxis regimens for leukopenia were also common. Within 1 month following leukopenia onset, no patients experienced acute rejection and 5 (14%) developed infection requiring hospitalization or opportunistic infection. CONCLUSION: In kidney recipients with leukopenia, G-CSF may be helpful to achieve WBC count recovery in addition to changes in immunosuppression and prophylaxis medications. Prospective, randomized data is still needed to determine optimal G-CSF dosing in this population. This article is protected by copyright.

"Multidisciplinary tumor boards have evolved to address the increasing complexity of cancer care management. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often arises in the setting of underlying cirrhosis, expert input from hepatologists alongside hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, radiation oncologists, interventional and body radiologists, and medical oncologists has become increasingly important in order to offer patients appropriate cancer treatments. The MDLTB structure has evolved since the early 2000s to bring these specialists together at regularly scheduled meetings to develop a therapeutic treatment plan for HCC management. MDLTBs have reduced the time to treatment and improved patient satisfaction. Standardized documentation with common data elements has been recommended to ensure adequate communication from MDLTB to referring healthcare providers. Retrospective studies consistently highlight the frequency of changes in treatment plans after MDLTB review to better adhere to guideline recommended care. Despite several decades of MDLTBs implementation, few studies describe clinical outcomes associated with MDLTBs such as patient survival and cost benefits. More research is needed in this area to further justify the heavy use of resources that are needed to maintain MDLTBs. Development and use of a centralized database to store such information may assist with future studies of clinical outcomes and inform quality improvement projects.",Multidisciplinary Approach to HCC Management: How Can This Be Done?
"Hydrogels serve as valuable tools for studying cell-extracellular matrix interactions in three-dimensional environments that recapitulate aspects of native extracellular matrix. However, the impact of early protein deposition on cell behaviour within hydrogels has largely been overlooked. Using a bio-orthogonal labelling technique, we visualized nascent proteins within a day of culture across a range of hydrogels. In two engineered hydrogels of interest in three-dimensional mechanobiology studies-proteolytically degradable covalently crosslinked hyaluronic acid and dynamic viscoelastic hyaluronic acid hydrogels-mesenchymal stromal cell spreading, YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation and osteogenic differentiation were observed with culture. However, inhibition of cellular adhesion to nascent proteins or reduction in nascent protein remodelling reduced mesenchymal stromal cell spreading and nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ, resulting in a shift towards adipogenic differentiation. Our findings emphasize the role of nascent proteins in the cellular perception of engineered materials and have implications for in vitro cell signalling studies and application to tissue repair.",Local nascent protein deposition and remodelling guide mesenchymal stromal cell mechanosensing and fate in three-dimensional hydrogels.
"High temperature increases all-cause mortality. Thermoregulatory ability is impaired in persons with elevated serum cholesterol, but can be improved by the administration of statins, even in the short-term. We investigated whether the impact of high temperature (>/=24 degrees C) on all-cause mortality among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults with a current or past indication for a statin is attenuated by current use of a statin with temperature dependence, by using claims data from five US Medicaid programs supplemented with Medicare claims for dual-enrollees and meteorological data from 1999-2010. We identified 3,508,948 persons (3,181,752 person-years) in a 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort. The incidence rate of all-cause mortality (deaths per 1,000 person-years) was 21.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.6 to 22.3) in current statin users and 30.1 (95% CI: 30.2 to 30.6) in former users. The adjusted odds ratios of mortality for current vs. former statin use were statistically significantly lower than 1.0, suggesting a protective effect of current statin use, on days with high temperature, with either daily average temperature or daily maximum temperature, and declined as daily average temperature increased from 29 degrees C and daily maximum temperature increased from 34 degrees C. These results were robust to the adjustment for daily relative humidity.",Effect of statins on the association between high temperature and all-cause mortality in a socioeconomically disadvantaged population: a cohort study.

"BACKGROUND: Stereotactic needle biopsy provides a minimally invasive option for the diagnosis of intracranial lesions but is limited by inconclusive diagnoses on frozen pathology. 5-Aminovelunic acid (5-ALA) and sodium fluorescein have previously demonstrated potential as diagnostic adjuvants for rapid pathology. Stereotactic biopsy with near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores has not been reported. OBJECTIVE: We identified five representative cases utilizing NIR-fluorescent dye Indocyanine Green (ICG), administered in a high dose, delayed manner. METHODS: Five patients underwent Second Window ICG (SWIG)-guided stereotactic biopsy for diagnosis of suspected glioma or tumor recurrence. Up to 5 mg/kg ICG was administered approximately 24 hours prior to surgery. Biopsies were conducted in the standard fashion, targeting regions of suspected tumor using intraoperative frameless navigation. Samples were examined intraoperatively under standard visible light and for fluorescence using conventional NIR imaging platforms. Findings were correlated with frozen and final tumor pathology for all cases. RESULTS: Ten biopsy specimens were obtained. Three did not fluoresce and did not demonstrate tumor on preliminary or final pathology, including a non-gadolinium-enhancing sample taken proximal to the final target. The remaining 7 fluoresced, of which 6 contained tumor and 1 contained necrosis. Fluorescence was also noted in a patient with radiation treatment effect. Overall fluorescence characteristics were highly concordant with preliminary and final diagnoses. CONCLUSION: SWIG provides rapid intraoperative confirmation of pathologic brain tissue by permeating neoplastic or inflammatory brain tissue via a mechanism similar to that of gadolinium enhancement. SWIG-guided stereotactic biopsy can improve surgical efficiency by enhancing confidence in acquisition of target tissue.",Intraoperative Molecular Imaging with Second Window ICG Facilitates Confirmation of Contrast-Enhancing Tissue During Intracranial Stereotactic Needle Biopsy: A Case Series.
"BACKGROUND: Open maternal-fetal surgery (OMFS) for fetal myelomeningocele (fMMC) results in reduction in neonatal morbidity related to spina bifida but may be associated with fetal, neonatal, and maternal complications in subsequent pregnancies. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to ascertain obstetric risk in subsequent pregnancies after OMFS for fMMC closure. STUDY DESIGN: An international multicenter prospective observational registry created to track and report maternal, obstetric, fetal/neonatal and subsequent pregnancy outcomes following OMFS for fMMC, was evaluated for subsequent pregnancy outcome variables. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for the registry. RESULTS: From 693 cases of OMFS for fMMC closure entered into the registry, 77 subsequent pregnancies in 60 women were identified. The overall live birth rate was 96.2% with 52 pregnancies delivering beyond 20 weeks gestational age and median gestational age at delivery of 37 (36.3-37.1) weeks. The uterine rupture rate was 9.6% (n=5), resulting in 2 fetal deaths. Maternal transfusion was required in 4 patients (7.7%). CONCLUSION: The risk of uterine rupture or dehiscence in subsequent pregnancies with associated fetal morbidity after OMFS is significant, but similar to that reported for subsequent pregnancies after classical cesarean deliveries. Future pregnancy considerations should be included in initial counseling for women contemplating OMFS.",Subsequent Pregnancy Outcomes After Open Maternal-Fetal Surgery for Myelomeningocele.
"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has wide-ranging and long-term consequences for young people and their families. The omission of outcomes that are important to young people with CKD and their caregivers limits knowledge to guide shared decision making. We aimed to identify the outcomes that are important to young people with CKD and their caregivers. STUDY DESIGN: We used the nominal group technique whereby participants identified and ranked outcomes and explained their priorities. SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: Young people with CKD (stages 1-5, dialysis, or transplantation) and their caregivers were purposively sampled from 6 centers across Australia, the United States, and Canada. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Importance scores were calculated (scale of 0-1), and qualitative data were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: 34 patients (aged 8-21 years) and 62 caregivers participated in 16 groups and identified 48 outcomes. The 5 highest ranked outcomes for patients were survival (importance score, 0.25), physical activity (0.24), fatigue (0.20), lifestyle restrictions (0.20), and growth (0.20); and for caregivers, kidney function (0.53), survival (0.28), infection (0.22), anemia (0.20), and growth (0.17). 12 themes were identified reflecting their immediate and current priorities (wanting to feel normal, strengthening resilience, minimizing intrusion into daily life, imminent threats to life, devastating family burdens, and seeking control over health) and considerations regarding future impacts (protecting health/development, remaining hopeful, concern for limited opportunities, prognostic uncertainty, dreading painful and invasive procedures, and managing expectations). LIMITATIONS: Only English-speaking participants were recruited. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney function, infection, survival, and growth were the highest priorities for patients with CKD and their caregivers. Young people with CKD also prioritized highly the outcomes that directly affected their lifestyle and sense of normality, while caregiver's highest priorities concerned the long-term health of their child, current health problems, and the financial and family burdens of caring for a child with CKD.",Identifying Important Outcomes for Young People With CKD and Their Caregivers: A Nominal Group Technique Study.
"Analytical antiretroviral treatment interruption (ATI) is an important feature of HIV research, seeking to achieve sustained viral suppression in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) when the goal is to measure effects of novel therapeutic interventions on time to viral load rebound or altered viral setpoint. Trials with ATIs also intend to determine host, virological, and immunological markers that are predictive of sustained viral control off ART. Although ATI is increasingly incorporated into proof-of-concept trials, no consensus has been reached on strategies to maximise its utility and minimise its risks. In addition, differences in ATI trial designs hinder the ability to compare efficacy and safety of interventions across trials. Therefore, we held a meeting of stakeholders from many interest groups, including scientists, clinicians, ethicists, social scientists, regulators, people living with HIV, and advocacy groups, to discuss the main challenges concerning ATI studies and to formulate recommendations with an emphasis on strategies for risk mitigation and monitoring, ART resumption criteria, and ethical considerations. In this Review, we present the major points of discussion and consensus views achieved with the goal of informing the conduct of ATIs to maximise the knowledge gained and minimise the risk to participants in clinical HIV research.",Recommendations for analytical antiretroviral treatment interruptions in HIV research trials-report of a consensus meeting.
"BACKGROUND: A preventive vaccine for HIV is a crucial public health need; adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated antibody gene delivery could be an alternative to immunisation to induce sustained expression of neutralising antibodies to prevent HIV. We assessed safety and tolerability of rAAV1-PG9DP, a recombinant AAV1 vector encoding the gene for PG9, a broadly neutralising antibody against HIV. METHODS: This first-in-human, proof-of-concept, double-blind, phase 1, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial was done at one clinical research centre in the UK. Healthy men aged 18-45 years without HIV infection were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular injection with rAAV1-PG9DP or placebo in the deltoid or quadriceps in one of four dose-escalating cohorts (group A, 4 x 10(12) vector genomes; group B, 4 x 10(13) vector genomes; group C, 8 x 10(13) vector genomes; and group D, 1.2 x 10(14) vector genomes). Volunteers were followed up for 48 weeks. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability. A secondary objective was to assess PG9 expression in serum and related HIV neutralisation activity. All volunteers were included in primary and safety analyses. The trial is complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01937455. FINDINGS: Between Jan 30, 2014, and Feb 28, 2017, 111 volunteers were screened for eligibility. 21 volunteers were eligible and provided consent, and all 21 completed 48 weeks of follow-up. Reactogenicity was generally mild or moderate and resolved without intervention. No probably or definitely related adverse events or serious adverse events were recorded. We detected PG9 by HIV neutralisation in the serum of four volunteers, and by RT-PCR in muscle biopsy samples from four volunteers. We did not detect PG9 by ELISA in serum. PG9 anti-drug antibody was present in ten volunteers in the higher dose groups. Both anti-AAV1 antibodies and AAV1-specific T-cell responses were detected. INTERPRETATION: Future studies should explore higher doses of AAV, alternative AAV serotypes and gene expression cassettes, or other broadly neutralising HIV antibodies.

"The ""CpG Island Methylator Phenotype"" (CIMP) has been found to be a useful concept in stratifying several types of human cancer into molecularly and clinically distinguishable subgroups. We have identified an additional epigenetic stratification category, the ""Outlier Methylation Phenotype"" (OMP). Whereas CIMP is defined on the basis of hyper-methylation in tumor genomes, OMP is defined on the basis of highly variant (either or both hyper- and hypo-methylation) methylation at many sites in normal tissues. OMP was identified and defined, originally, as being more common among low birth weight individuals conceived in vitro but we have also identified OMP individuals among colon cancer patients profiled by us, as well as multiple types of cancer patients in the TCGA database. The cause(s) of OMP are unknown, as is whether these individuals identify a clinically useful subgroup of patients, but both the causes of, and potential consequences to, this epigenetically distinct group are of great interest.",Highly variant DNA methylation in normal tissues identifies a distinct subclass of cancer patients.
"The management of lymphatic malformations (LMs) is challenging, particularly for large and complex lesions involving anatomical structures in the adjacent tissue. While lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) has been reported as an effective treatment for lymphedema, it has hardly been described as a treatment for LM. Virtual reality has the ability to visualize human structures in three dimensions and can be used for the preoperative planning of complex cases. Here, we describe the first case of the management of an LM by LVA preoperatively planned with virtual reality. A young woman presented with an LM previously treated by gross excision. Following persistent complaints of swelling, a minimally invasive microsurgical intervention was planned. The results of the single photon emission tomography with computed tomography (SPECT-CT) and lymphoscintigraphy were analyzed using a virtual reality program, and a 3D patient-specific model was constructed. Based on the combined findings of this 3D model and lymphography with a fluorescent marker, a precise skin incision could be determined and one lymph vessel was anastomosed to a nearby vein. The swelling of the thigh reduced and the discomfort disappeared. Although more reports are needed to confirm its efficacy, LVA planned with virtual reality constructed images appears to be a valuable treatment option for complex lesions, including LMs.",The Application of Virtual Reality for Preoperative Planning of Lymphovenous Anastomosis in a Patient with a Complex Lymphatic Malformation.

"Autophagy is a highly conserved lysosome-mediated protective cellular process in which cytosolic components, including damaged organelles and long-lived proteins, are cleared. Many studies have shown that autophagy was upregulated in hypoxic regions. However, the precise molecular mechanism of hypoxia-induced autophagy in colorectal cancer (CRC) is still elusive. In this study, we found that miR-20a was significantly downregulated under hypoxia in colon cancer cells, and overexpression of miR-20a alleviated hypoxia-induced autophagy. Moreover, miR-20a inhibits the hypoxia-induced autophagic flux by targeting multiple key regulators of autophagy, including ATG5 and FIP200. Furthermore, by dual-luciferase assay we demonstrated that miR-20a directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of ATG5 and FIP200, regulating their messenger RNA and protein levels. In addition, reintroduction of exogenous ATG5 or FIP200 partially reversed miR-20a-mediated autophagy inhibition under hypoxia. A negative correlation between miR-20a and its target genes is observed in the hypoxic region of colon cancer tissues. Taken together, our findings suggest that hypoxia-mediated autophagy was regulated by miR-20a/ATG5/FI200 signaling pathway in CRC. miR-20a-mediated autophagy defect that might play an important role in hypoxia-induced autophagy during colorectal tumorigenesis.",miR-20a inhibits hypoxia-induced autophagy by targeting ATG5/FIP200 in colorectal cancer.
"Alcohol-associated liver disease can be coded in UNOS as either alcoholic cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis (AH), without specific criteria to assign either diagnosis. In this multi-center ACCELERATE-AH study, we sought to assess the concordance of clinician-diagnosis of AH at LT listing versus UNOS data-entry of AH as listing diagnosis. In a prior study, consecutive early LT recipients for AH between 2012-2017 were identified by chart review at 10 ACCELERATE-AH sites. In this current study, these same LT recipients were identified in the UNOS database; the primary UNOS diagnostic code was evaluated for concordance with the chart-review assignment of AH. In cases where the primary listing diagnosis in UNOS was not AH, we determined the reason for alternate classification. Among 124 ACCELERATE-AH LT recipients with a chart-review diagnosis of AH, only 43/124 (35%) had AH as listing diagnosis in UNOS; 80 (64%) were listed as alcoholic cirrhosis, and 1 (1%) as fulminant hepatic necrosis. Of the 81 patients missing AH as a UNOS listing diagnosis code, reasons for alternate classification identified were: 44 (54%) lack of awareness of a separate diagnosis code for AH; 13 (16%) concomitant clinical diagnosis of AH and alcoholic cirrhosis in the chart; 12 (15%) clinical uncertainty regarding the diagnosis of AH versus acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis; and 12 (15%) data entry error. Conclusion: In a large cohort of LT recipients with AH, only 35% were documented as such in UNOS. Increased education and awareness for those performing UNOS data entry, establishment of specific criteria to define AH in the UNOS database and ability to document dates of alcohol use would allow future research on alcohol-associated liver disease to be more informative.

Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, we used time-trend analysis to evaluate 3 periods: 2000 through 2004, 2005 through 2009, and 2010 through 2014. The study was conducted in a multicenter setting through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, which is made up of a voluntary working group of more than 450 transplant centers worldwide. Two groups of infants aged 1 year or younger in 2 cohorts were included: those with malignant conditions, such as leukemia, and those with nonmalignant disorders, including immunodeficiencies. Data analysis was conducted from July 2017 to December 2018. Exposures: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Main Outcomes and Measures: Survival trends, disease relapse, and toxicity. Results: A total of 2498 infants with a median age of 7 months (range, <1-12 months) were included. In the nonmalignant cohort (n = 472), survival rates improved from the first to the second period (hazard ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.63-0.93]; P = .007) but did not change after 2004. Compared with infants with nonmalignant diseases (n = 2026; 3-year overall survival: 2000-2004, 375/577 [65.0%]; 2005-2009, 503/699 [72.0%]; and 2010-2014, 555/750 [74.0%]), those with malignant conditions had poorer survival rates, without improvement over time (3-year overall survival: 2000-2004, 109/199 [54.8%]; 2005-2009, 104/161 [64.6%]; and 2010-2014, 66/112 [58.9%]). From 2000 through 2014, relapse rates increased in infants with malignant conditions (3-year relapse rate: 2000-2004, 19% [95% CI, 14%-25%]; 2005-2009, 23% [95% CI, 17%-30%]; 2010-2014, 36% [95% CI, 27%-46%]; P = .01). Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was frequent, occurring with a cumulative incidence of 13% (95% CI, 11%-16%) of infants with nonmalignant diseases and 32% (95% CI, 22%-42%) of those with malignant diseases. Generally, recipients of human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling bone marrow grafts had the best outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: Survival rates have not improved for infants with malignant diseases over the 15-year study period. Infants with nonmalignant diseases had improved survival rates in the earlier but not the later study period. Higher relapses for the malignant cohort and toxicities for all infants remain significant challenges. Strategies to reduce relapse and toxicity and optimize donor and graft selection may improve outcomes in the future.",Survival Trends in Infants Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant.

"Importance: Guidelines for declaration of brain death in children were revised in 2011 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Child Neurology Society. Despite widespread medical, legal, and ethical acceptance, ongoing controversies exist with regard to the concept of brain death and the procedures for its determination. Objectives: To determine the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of pediatric patients declared brain dead in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study involved the abstraction of all patient deaths from the Virtual Pediatric Systems national multicenter database between January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2017. All patients who died in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient demographics, preillness developmental status, severity of illness, cause of death, PICU medical and physical length of stay, and organ donation status, as well as comparison between patients who were declared brain dead vs those who sustained cardiovascular or cardiopulmonary death. Results: Of the 15344 patients who died, 3170 (20.7%) were declared brain dead; 1861 of these patients (58.7%) were male, and 1401 (44.2%) were between 2 and 12 years of age. There was a linear association between PICU size and number of patients declared brain dead per year, with an increase of 4.27 patients (95% CI, 3.46-5.08) per 1000-patient increase in discharges (P < .001). The median (interquartile range) of patients declared brain dead per year ranged from 1 (0-3) in smaller PICUs (defined as those with <500 discharges per year) to 10 (7-15) for larger PICUs (those with 2000-4000 discharges per year). The most common causative mechanisms of brain death were hypoxic-ischemic injury owing to cardiac arrest (1672 of 3170 [52.7%]), shock and/or respiratory arrest without cardiac arrest (399 of 3170 [12.6%]), and traumatic brain injury (634 of 3170 [20.0%]). Most patients declared brain dead (681 of 807 [84.4%]) did not have preexisting neurological dysfunction. Patients who were organ donors (1568 of 3144 [49.9%]) remained in the PICU longer after declaration of brain death compared with those who were not donors (median [interquartile range], 29 [6-41] hours vs 4 [1-8] hours; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Brain death occurred in one-fifth of PICU deaths. Most children declared brain dead had no preexisting neurological dysfunction and had an acute hypoxic-ischemic or traumatic brain injury. Brain death determinations are infrequent, even in large PICUs, emphasizing the importance of ongoing education for medical professionals and standardization of protocols to ensure diagnostic accuracy and consistency.",Epidemiology of Brain Death in Pediatric Intensive Care Units in the United States.
"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore maternal child nurses' knowledge and beliefs about using pasteurized donor human milk (PDHM) to treat newborns with hypoglycemia. Pasteurized donor human milk has been used for decades in neonatal intensive care units, but its use is relatively new in the well-baby population. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Focus groups of maternal child nurses were conducted to explore this topic. RESULTS: Six focus groups that included a total 20 nurses were held. Four themes were identified: 1) nurses presumed safety of PDHM but lacked knowledge, 2) nurses' role as patient-family advocate, 3) nurses' logistical concerns about implementation of PDHM, and 4) nurses lacked clarity on formal milk sharing versus PDHM. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: As the use of PDHM increases for well babies, nurses will need more education about PDHM, its safety profile, its use in breastfeeding support and protection of the infant microbiome, and how PDHM differs from informal milk sharing. Nurses play an important role in helping parents weigh risks and benefits of using PDHM or formula when supplementation is needed during the hospital stay. It is important that nurses feel confident in their own knowledge and ability to address parental concerns so they can advocate for their patients and support parental decisionmaking.",Nurses' Views on Using Pasteurized Donor Human Milk for Hypoglycemic Term Infants.

"CASE: A 50-year-old man with a history of chronic refractory periprosthetic joint infection following total hip arthroplasty, which had been treated with multiple antibiotic spacers, developed an enteroarticular fistula. He was able to avoid hip disarticulation after undergoing a laparoscopic colectomy with a diverting colostomy and a functional hip resection arthroplasty. At the 1-year follow-up, he was walking independently with crutches and had minimal pain. CONCLUSION: An enteroarticular fistula following total hip arthroplasty is a rare and serious complication. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case that occurred in the setting of an antibiotic spacer.

"The purpose of the present article was to evaluate the previously unreported vascular alterations in Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) 3460 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation. Among the three primary mtDNA mutations, namely 11778, 14484, and 3460, LHON 3460 is the most rare and historically recognized as having the poorest visual prognosis. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel imaging modaility providing high-resolution microcirculation maps and enhancing visualization of the optic disc and peripapillary capillary beds. We herein exploit the advantages of OCTA, for the first time, to assess the optic nerve head and peripapillary microvasculature changes in an affected patient and compare these vascular changes with an asymptomatic carrier for LHON 3460, serving as a control. Vascular changes in LHON 11778 and 14484 have classically shown microvasculature attenuation localized specifically to the temporal peripapillary quadrant. In the present case, however, OCTA in LHON 3460, the most severe of the three mutational subtypes, illustrated significant vascular attenuation involving the nasal peripapillary region in addition to the temporal peripapillary microvascular changes classically seen in LHON. Our findings suggest that vascular measures may serve useful for objectively assessing mitochondrial disease. Further OCTA studies involving the nasal peripapillary region may be warranted to further understand vascular pathogenesis in LHON.",Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy: Severe vascular pathology in a severe primary mutation.
"Background: We report the incidence of Chiari malformation I (CMI) in a cohort of 377 patients with isolated sagittal synostosis (ISS), which is to the best of our knowledge the largest such series reported to date. Methods: A retrospective review of patients seen at a single institution from 2007 to 2017 was completed. ISS, Chiari malformations (CMI and CMII) and hydrocephalus were diagnosed by a senior neuroradiologist (G.Z.). Patients who met the inclusion criteria were divided into early (group A) and late (group B) presenting groups, as well as operated (group I) and unoperated (group II) groups. The patients were further subdivided into group AI (early operated), group AII (early unoperated), group BI (late operated), and group BII (late unoperated). Once identified, patient notes were examined for the following data sets: date of birth, age of presentation, age at last follow-up, other systemic conditions as well as molecular testing results. Surgical interventions, ophthalmological, and other relevant data were recorded. Statistical analysis was run in the form of a chi-square test to identify a significant difference between each subgroup. A literature review of the incidence of Chiari malformations in patients with ISS was conducted. Results: Three hundred seventy-seven patients constitute the study's total cohort (272 were males and 105 females). This cohort was divided into patients who underwent surgical repair of ISS (group 1: n = 200), and patients who did not (group 2: n = 177). The entire cohort was also divided into early (group A: n = 161) and late (group B: n = 216) presenting craniosynostosis. In the total cohort, 22/377 (5.8%) patients with CMI were identified. CMI was found in 14/200 (7.0%) patients in group I, and 8/177 (4.5%) patients in group II. CMI was found in 2/161 (1%) patients in group A, and 20/216 (9.2%) patients in group B. The incidence of CMI in group AI (early operated) was 2/151 (1.3%), in group AII (early unoperated) was 0/10, in group BI (late operated) was 11/49 (21%), and in group BII (late unoperated) was 9/167 (5.4%). Chi-square analysis revealed a significant difference between the incidence of CMI in the early-presenting (group A) and late-presenting (group B) groups (P = 0.001) and between the late-presenting operated (BI) and late-presenting unoperated (BII) groups (P = 0.001). The incidence of hydrocephalus was 1.6% (6/377) in the total cohort. However, all patients diagnosed with hydrocephalus came from group II (no surgical ISS correction). The incidence of hydrocephalus in group II was 3.3% (6/177). The incidence of hydrocephalus in group BII (late unoperated ISS) was 3.0% (5/167). The incidence of hydrocephalus in group AII (early unoperated ISS) was 9.0% (1/11). Conclusions: We noted the highest incidence of CMI-21%-in group BI (late-presenting operated). We noted hydrocephalus in group II (nonoperated), with the highest incidence of hydrocephalus found in the group BII (late-presenting unoperated) subgroup. We therefore recommend patients with ISS receive funduscopic examination to screen for raised intracranial pressure (ICP) associated with CMI and hydrocephalus, especially patients with late-presenting ISS.",The Incidence of Chiari Malformations in Patients with Isolated Sagittal Synostosis.
"As the consequences of liberal opioid prescribing have become apparent, efforts to address the role of the health care system in supporting more balanced opioid use and the prevention and treatment of opioid use disorder have increased. Developing a unified and multidisciplinary approach can lead to an integrated care model that emphasizes primary prevention, harm reduction, and transition to life-sustaining treatment while also maintaining attentiveness to effective pain management. A model for this, which follows the nomenclature in proscribing antimicrobial use, is the development of an opioid stewardship program. Such programs allow for the integration of diverse perspectives and new mandates and uses a patient-centered approach with an iterative evaluation process. We describe a group of adoptable efforts that have been utilized successfully at our institutions and may be adapted and optimized to the needs and resources of other hospitals and health care systems.",Stewarding Recovery from the Opioid Crisis Through Health System Initiatives.
"BACKGROUND: This article presents an overview of pediatric relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in pediatric patients. OBJECTIVES: Acute and chronic post-CAR T-cell effects and considerations are discussed, along with survivorship considerations. METHODS: A case study illustrates the identification and management of physiologic and psychosocial sequelae. FINDINGS: B-cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and cumulative effects of CAR T-cell therapy and other treatments are a concern in the pediatric population. Unique to pediatric and young adult survivors of childbearing potential are implications for post-treatment fertility. Financial toxicities and psychosocial needs require a family-centered approach to interventions that address the impact of CAR T-cell therapy not only on the patient, but also on caregivers and siblings.",Pediatric Survivorship: Considerations Following CAR T-Cell Therapy.

"The (13)C-ketoisocaproate ((13)C-KICA) breath test (BT) has been recently proposed as a non-invasive test for assessing hepatic mitochondrial function. Results of the (13)C-KICA BT can be expressed as different parameters. However, the best parameter for expressing the (13)C-KICA BT result is uncertain which hinders use of the BT in routine clinical practice. We have investigated the repeatability of different parameters of (13)C-KICA BT. Thirteen healthy adult subjects (5 men and 8 women) underwent a (13)C-KICA BT on two occasions separated by a gap of approximately 30 days. There were no significant differences between the repeated measurements for all the test parameters over 30 days. Furthermore, the Bland Altman statistics showed no fixed or proportional bias for any of the test parameters. The cumulative (13)C-dose enrichment over 60 min had the lowest within-subject variability of 12% compared to all other test parameters. The cumulative (13)C-dose enrichment over 60 min could be a very useful parameter for the (13)C-KICA BT to detect impaired hepatic mitochondrial function in patients with chronic liver diseases.",The evaluation of the repeatability of the (13)C-ketoisocaproate breath test for assessing hepatic mitochondrial function.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article was written in order to bring the reader up to date with developments that have occurred in the treatment of Tourette disorder (TD) over the last 5 years. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the fact that TD has been recognized for over a century, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains poor. There has been limited development in the last 5 years for new therapeutic options. Aripipazole is the only newly approved pharmaceutical therapy for TD in the last 5 years, although several medications are under active study. For the most severely affected individuals, there is increasing experience with surgical interventions. One of the most promising areas of research is the work of genetic consortiums currently looking into identifying the underlying pathogenetic basis which in turn will hopefully lead to the development of safer and more effective therapies.",Advances in the Treatment of Tourette's Disorder.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with relapsed T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have limited therapeutic options and a poor prognosis. Although a variety of salvage chemotherapy regimens may be used, response rates are unsatisfactory. This article summarizes current approaches and promising emerging strategies for the treatment of relapsed T-ALL. RECENT FINDINGS: Although nelarabine is the only agent approved specifically for T-ALL, recent studies have identified a variety of genetic alterations and signaling pathways that are critical in its pathogenesis. Based on these findings, a number of small-molecule inhibitors and other targeted therapies are being studied for relapsed T-ALL, including gamma-secretase inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and mTOR inhibitors. In addition, pre-clinical studies of chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD5 and CD7 as well as the monoclonal antibody daratumumab have shown promising results for T-ALL. Relapsed T-ALL currently remains challenging to treat, but recent pre-clinical studies of targeted and immunotherapeutic agents have shown encouraging results. A number of clinical trials investigating these approaches for T-ALL are currently underway.",Relapsed T Cell ALL: Current Approaches and New Directions.
"BACKGROUND: Untreated opioid addiction in people with HIV is associated with poor HIV treatment outcomes. Slow-release, long-acting, implantable naltrexone might improve these outcomes. Here, we present results of a study aimed to test this hypothesis. METHODS: We did a 48 week double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, phase 3, randomised trial with men and women addicted to opioids who were starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV and whose viral loads were higher than 1000 copies per mL. Participants were seeking treatment at two HIV and two narcology programme centres in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and the surrounding Leningrad region. The Pavlov statistical department created a table with stratification on gender distribution, viral load, and CD4 cell count. We stratified participants according to gender, viral load, and CD4 cells per muL, and randomly assigned (1:1) them to addiction treatment with a naltrexone implant and oral naltrexone placebo (implant group) or oral naltrexone and placebo implant (oral group). The primary outcome was plasma viral load of less than 400 copies per mL at 24 weeks and 48 weeks. We included all randomly assigned participants in outcome analyses (intention to treat). Treatment staff and patients were masked to group assignment. The study is complete and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01101815. FINDINGS: Between July 14, 2011, and April 14, 2014, 238 potential participants were recruited and screened, 35 were excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria, three declined to participate, and 200 were randomly assigned to treatment (100 to each group). At week 24, 38 (38) participants in the implant group and 35 (35%) in the oral group had viral loads less than 400 copies per mL (risk ratio 1.1, 95% CI 0.76-1.56; p=0.77). At week 48, 66 participants in the implant group and 50 in the oral group had viral loads less than 400 copies per mL (risk ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.68; p=0.045). There were seven serious adverse events: three deaths in the implant group (one due to heart disease, one trauma, and one AIDS), and four in the oral group (two overdoses, one pancreatic cancer, and one AIDS). The overdose deaths occurred 9-10 months after the last naltrexone dose. INTERPRETATION: The longer the blockade of opioid effects, the more protection an individual gets from missed ART doses and impulsive behaviours that lead to relapse and poor, even fatal, outcomes. Commercial development of implants could result in a meaningful addition to addiction treatment options.

"BACKGROUND: The authors introduce an algorithm for preoperative planning of optimal lateral circumflex femoral artery system perforator flap (LCFAPF) supplied by the best quality and the easiest dissection of the perforators and the source vessels for simplified and customized strategies in head and neck reconstruction with perforator navigation using color Doppler ultrasound and three-dimensional reconstruction (3D-CDUS PN). METHODS: Between June 2011 and September 2015, a prospective cohort study was performed with an algorithm based on defect site, perforator type, and pedicle length using 3D-CDUS PN to select optimal perforators arising from the different branches of LCFA in 108 patients. The optimal perforator and flap were determined by perforator caliber and quality, difficulty in flap dissection, and length of the source vessels. Cause and classification of the defect, flap choice, recipient vessels, postoperative course, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: The source vessels of the perforators were lateral descending branch in 73 cases and oblique branch in 17 cases with ALTPFs, medial descending branch in 12 cases with AMTPFs, and ascending branch in 6 cases with TFLPFs. Straightforward dissection of flaps with septocutaneous (n=40) and semi-septocutaneous (n=17) perforators was performed in 52.8% cases. Successful exploration rate and overall flap survival rate were both 100%. Satisfactory functional and esthetic results in both recipient and donor sites with no serious complications were observed in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm using 3D-CDUS PN facilitates selection of optimal flap with better caliber and quality of the perforators and sufficient pedicle length for easy dissection.",Perforator navigation using color Doppler ultrasound and three-dimensional reconstruction for preoperative planning of optimal lateral circumflex femoral artery system perforator flaps in head and neck reconstruction.
"OBJECTIVE: To identify personal qualities and teaching methods of highly effective surgical educators using a novel research design. DESIGN: In this qualitative study, surgical residents were sent an electronic survey soliciting nominations for faculty perceived as highly effective surgical educators. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with surgeons receiving the most nominations. Grounded theory methodology identified themes for analysis. SETTING: General, vascular, and plastic surgery residents and faculty at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 77 surgical residents were surveyed. Data saturation occurred after 12 semistructured interviews with attending surgeons, corresponding to the top 15% of faculty. RESULTS: Interviewees described both personal characteristics and specific teaching approaches that facilitated successful learning. These included providing exceptional surgical education as a mission, a strong influence from past mentors and role models, a love for the profession, and a low rate of self-professed burnout. Desirable teaching methods included promoting a culture of psychological safety (the perceived ability to take interpersonal risks within one's environment), progressive autonomy, accountability of trainees, and individualized teaching for the learner. Interviewees saw education as inseparable from clinical duties, and all surgeons believed providing exceptional patient care was the foundation of effective surgical teaching. The derived themes suggested that educators prefer ""cognitive-based"" approaches, focusing on learning processes rather than specific outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified characteristics and educational styles of highly effective educators in a cohort of academic surgeons. This framework may inform the development of educational programs for residents and faculty in effective teaching methods.",Qualities and Methods of Highly Effective Surgical Educators: A Grounded Theory Model.

"Mutations in several genes encoding components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex cause neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we report on five individuals with mutations in SMARCD1; the individuals present with developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and small hands and feet. Trio exome sequencing proved the mutations to be de novo in four of the five individuals. Mutations in other SWI/SNF components cause Coffin-Siris syndrome, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, or other syndromic and non-syndromic NDDs. Although the individuals presented here have dysmorphisms and some clinical overlap with these syndromes, they lack their typical facial dysmorphisms. To gain insight into the function of SMARCD1 in neurons, we investigated the Drosophila ortholog Bap60 in postmitotic memory-forming neurons of the adult Drosophila mushroom body (MB). Targeted knockdown of Bap60 in the MB of adult flies causes defects in long-term memory. Mushroom-body-specific transcriptome analysis revealed that Bap60 is required for context-dependent expression of genes involved in neuron function and development in juvenile flies when synaptic connections are actively being formed in response to experience. Taken together, we identify an NDD caused by SMARCD1 mutations and establish a role for the SMARCD1 ortholog Bap60 in the regulation of neurodevelopmental genes during a critical time window of juvenile adult brain development when neuronal circuits that are required for learning and memory are formed.","A Syndromic Neurodevelopmental Disorder Caused by Mutations in SMARCD1, a Core SWI/SNF Subunit Needed for Context-Dependent Neuronal Gene Regulation in Flies."
"OBJECTIVE: Family psychosocial risk screening is an important initial step in delivering evidence-based care in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Establishing an evidence-based screening approach that is acceptable, reliable and valid is an essential step in psychosocial care delivery. METHODS: This is a three-institution multi-method study. In Part 1 caregivers of children about to undergo HCT (n=140) completed the Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT), a brief parent report screener adapted for HCT, and validating questionnaires. Families received feedback on their risks identified on the PAT. In Part 2, 12 caregivers completed a semi-structured interview about their perceptions of the PAT and the feedback process. The reliability and validity of the PAT-HCT total and subscales scores were tested using Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) and Pearson correlations. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative interview data. RESULTS: Internal consistency for the total score (KR-20=0.88) and the Child Problems, Sibling Problems, Family Problems and Stress Reactions subscales were strong (KR-20 > 0.70). Family Structure, Social Support and Family Beliefs subscales were adequate (KR-20=0.55 - 0.63). Moderate to strong correlations with the criteria measures provided validation for the total and subscale scores. Feedback was provided to 97.14% of the families who completed the PAT-HCT and mean ratings of acceptability were above 4.00 (5-point scale). The qualitative data indicate that families appreciate the efforts to provide screening and feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The PAT-HCT is a psychometrically sound screener for use in HCT. Feedback can be given to families. Both the screener and the feedback process are acceptable to caregivers.",Screening for family psychosocial risk in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with The Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT).
"This descriptive study sought to establish an oral health baseline of need for enrollees at a Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) and identify opportunities for nursing interventions. The Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) was applied to a random sample of 120 enrollees, 64 of whom met inclusion criteria, agreed to participate to assess their oral health status, and were included in the analysis. The mean OHAT score was 4.4 (SD = 2.6; range 0-12). Higher scores indicate poorer oral health. The oral conditions found needing the most attention were gums, saliva, natural teeth, dentures, and oral cleanliness. Oral cleanliness scored the worst on the OHAT, highlighting opportunities for nursing interventions and the necessity for oral hygiene routines.

"OBJECTIVE: To investigate patient factors predictive of gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) normalization following ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy in children with primary sclerosing cholangitis. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed patient records at 46 centers. We included patients with a baseline serum GGT level >/=50 IU/L at diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis who initiated UDCA therapy within 1 month and continued therapy for at least 1 year. We defined ""normalization"" as a GGT level <50 IU/L without experiencing portal hypertensive or dominant stricture events, liver transplantation, or death during the first year. RESULTS: We identified 263 patients, median age 12.1 years at diagnosis, treated with UDCA at a median dose of 15 mg/kg/d. Normalization occurred in 46%. Patients with normalization had a lower prevalence of Crohn's disease, lower total bilirubin level, lower aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index, greater platelet count, and greater serum albumin level at diagnosis. The 5-year survival with native liver was 99% in those patients who achieved normalization vs 77% in those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Less than one-half of the patients treated with UDCA have a complete GGT normalization in the first year after diagnosis, but this subset of patients has a favorable 5-year outcome. Normalization is less likely in patients with a Crohn's disease phenotype or a laboratory profile suggestive of more advanced hepatobiliary fibrosis. Patients who do not achieve normalization could reasonably stop UDCA, as they are likely not receiving clinical benefit. Alternative treatments with improved efficacy are needed, particularly for patients with already-advanced disease.",Ursodeoxycholic Acid Therapy in Pediatric Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: Predictors of Gamma Glutamyltransferase Normalization and Favorable Clinical Course.

"p27 shifts from CDK inhibitor to oncogene when phosphorylated by PI3K effector kinases. Here, we show that p27 is a cJun coregulator, whose assembly and chromatin association is governed by p27 phosphorylation. In breast and bladder cancer cells with high p27pT157pT198 or expressing a CDK-binding defective p27pT157pT198 phosphomimetic (p27CK-DD), cJun is activated and interacts with p27, and p27/cJun complexes localize to the nucleus. p27/cJun up-regulates TGFB2 to drive metastasis in vivo. Global analysis of p27 and cJun chromatin binding and gene expression shows that cJun recruitment to many target genes is p27 dependent, increased by p27 phosphorylation, and activates programs of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and metastasis. Finally, human breast cancers with high p27pT157 differentially express p27/cJun-regulated genes of prognostic relevance, supporting the biological significance of the work.",p27 transcriptionally coregulates cJun to drive programs of tumor progression.
"ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is the predominant source of nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA, a fundamental building block of carbon metabolism in eukaryotes. ACLY is aberrantly regulated in many cancers, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms determining ACLY activity and function are unclear. To this end, we investigated the role of the uncharacterized ACLY C-terminal citrate synthase homology domain (CSHD) in the mechanism of acetyl-CoA formation. Using recombinant and purified ACLY and a suite of biochemical and biophysical approaches, including analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, and thermal stability assays, we demonstrate that the C-terminus maintains ACLY tetramerization, a conserved and essential quaternary structure in vitro and likely also in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the C-terminus, only in the context of the full-length enzyme, is necessary for full ACLY binding to CoA, stability and catalysis. Together, we demonstrate that ACLY forms a homotetramer through the C-terminus to facilitate CoA binding and acetyl-CoA production. Our findings highlight a novel and unique role of the C-terminal citrate synthase homology domain in ACLY function and catalysis, adding to the understanding of the molecular basis for acetyl-CoA synthesis by ACLY. This newly discovered means of ACLY regulation has implications for the development of novel ACLY modulators to target acetyl-CoA dependent cellular processes for potential therapeutic use.",ATP-citrate lyase multimerization is required for coenzyme-A substrate binding and catalysis.
"Pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) is a lethal cancer with no effective therapies. To understand the mechanisms of tumor evolution in this cancer, we performed whole genome sequencing with linked reads on longitudinally resected pGBM samples. Our analyses showed that all diagnostic and recurrent samples were collections of genetically diverse subclones. Clonal composition rapidly evolved at recurrence, with less than 8% of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants being shared in diagnostic-recurrent pairs. To track the origins of the mutational events observed in pGBM, we generated whole genome datasets for two patients and their parents. These trios showed that genetic variants could be (i) somatic, (ii) inherited from a healthy parent, or (iii) de novo in the germlines of pGBM patients. Analysis of variant allele frequencies supported a model of tumor growth involving slow-cycling cancer stem cells that give rise to fast-proliferating progenitor-like cells and to non-dividing cells. Interestingly, radiation and anti-mitotic chemotherapeutics did not increase overall tumor burden upon recurrence. These findings support an important role for slow-cycling stem cell populations in contributing to recurrences, since slow-cycling cell populations are expected to be less prone to genotoxic stress induced by these treatments and therefore would accumulate few mutations. Our results highlight the need for new targeted treatments that account for the complex functional hierarchies and genomic heterogeneity of pGBM.",Intratumoral genetic and functional heterogeneity in pediatric glioblastoma.
"BACKGROUND: While autoimmunity and hyperinflammation secondary to recombinase activating gene (RAG) deficiency have been associated with delayed diagnosis and even death, our current understanding is limited primarily to small case series. OBJECTIVE: Understand the frequency, severity, and treatment responsiveness of autoimmunity and hyperinflammation in RAG deficiency. METHODS: In reviewing the literature and our own database, we identified 85 patients with RAG deficiency, reported between 2001 and 2016, and compiled the largest case series to date of 63 patients with prominent autoimmune and/or hyperinflammatory pathology. RESULTS: Diagnosis of RAG deficiency was delayed a median of 5 years from the first clinical signs of immune dysregulation. The majority of patients (55.6%) presented with more than one autoimmune or hyperinflammatory complication, with the most common etiologies being cytopenias (84.1%), granulomas (23.8%), and inflammatory skin disorders (19.0%). Infections, including live viral vaccinations, closely preceded the onset of autoimmunity in 28.6% of cases. Autoimmune cytopenias had early onset (median 1.9, 2.1, and 2.6 years for autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune neutropenia (AN), respectively) and were refractory to intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and rituximab in the majority of cases (64.7%, 73.7%, and 71.4% for AIHA, ITP, and AN, respectively). Evans syndrome specifically was associated with lack of response to first-line therapy. Treatment-refractory autoimmunity/hyperinflammation prompted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 20 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmunity/hyperinflammation can be a presenting sign of RAG deficiency and should prompt further evaluation. Multi-lineage cytopenias are often refractory to immunosuppressive treatment and may require hematopoietic cell transplantation for definitive management.",Outcomes and treatment strategies for autoimmunity and hyperinflammation in patients with RAG deficiency.
"During the last two decades, our knowledge on the genetic bases of Mendelian forms of dystonia has expanded significantly. This has translated into the generation of multiple cell and animal models to explore the neurobiological bases of this hyperkinetic movement disorder. A majority of these studies have focused on DYT1 dystonia, caused by dominant mutations in the gene encoding for the protein torsinA. Since its discovery, work in multiple laboratories helped identify the subcellular localization of torsinA, key structural features, functionally important physical interactions and biological pathways and physiological events influenced by torsinA. Moreover, recent experimental work indicates potential shared pathogenic pathways between different genetic forms of dystonia. This review will summarize our current knowledge on the molecular and basic biological features of torsinA and its dysfunction when carrying disease-causing mutation, identifying future research priorities and proposing a model of dystonia pathogenesis that might extend beyond DYT1.",Advances in molecular and cell biology of dystonia: Focus on torsinA.
"BACKGROUND: Parents of children in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) report inadequate communication and a lack of empathy during conversations with their clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To assess quantitatively and qualitatively the contributions made by team members of different professions in communicating with parents during family meetings. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING/SUBJECTS: The pediatric CICU at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Subjects were members of the interprofessional team attending family meetings for patients admitted to the CICU longer than two weeks. MEASUREMENTS: We used quantitative conversation attribution and coding to compare durations of attendee contributions and contribution type by professional role. The SCOPE codebook and other quantitative codes drawn from best practices in family meetings were used to measure communication behaviors. A qualitative analysis of nurses' and social workers' contributions was used to identify themes not otherwise captured. RESULTS: Across 10 meetings, physicians spoke for an average of 78.1% (SD 10.7%) of each meeting, non-physicians 9.6% (SD 7.8%), and parents 17.4% (SD 12.2%). Parental understanding was assessed an average of 0.2 (SD 0.4) times per meeting. Parents expressed emotion an average of 4.2 times per meeting (SD 7.1) and the clinical team responded empathetically 2.2 times per meeting (SD 4.3). All clinician empathic responses were a minority of their overall contributions. Conversation was almost exclusively between physicians and families until physicians indicated other team members could contribute. CONCLUSIONS: Coordination of team members' roles in the meetings may improve parental engagement necessary for decision-making and empathic responses that are often missed.",Interprofessional Teamwork During Family Meetings in the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.
"The mammalian blood coagulation system was designed to restrict blood loss due to injury as well as keep the blood fluid within the blood vessels of the organism. Blood coagulation activity in inbred mouse strains varies widely among strains, suggesting that many genomic variants affect hemostasis. Some of these molecules have been discovered and characterized; however, many are still unknown. Genetically modified mouse technologies are providing a plethora of new mouse models for investigating the regulation of blood coagulation. Here we provide a protocol for the tail bleeding time as a primary assessment of in vivo blood coagulation, as well as in vitro methods such as the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin generation assay. We also provide protocols for the assessment of the activities of specific known factors involved in blood coagulation.

"OBJECTIVE: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), it is unclear if women are less likely to achieve low disease activity (LDA). We evaluated sex differences in remission and LDA, comparing different clinical and imaging measures. METHODS: We utilized data from the Veterans Affairs RA (VARA) registry and from two clinical trials. Remission and LDA were defined using composite scores, individual items (tender joints, swollen joints, ESR, CRP, evaluator/patient global assessment), and MRI. In VARA, we assessed 1) the likelihood of point remission at any time during follow-up using logistic regression, and 2) time to sustained remission (2 consecutive visits) using Cox proportional hazard models. In the clinical trials, logistic regression models evaluated the likelihood of low clinical and MRI activity at 52 weeks. RESULTS: Among 2463 patients in VARA women (10.2%) were less likely to be in DAS28-ESR remission in follow-up [OR: 0.71 (0.55, 0.91) p<0.01] and had a longer time to sustained DAS28-ESR remission. This difference was not observed for DAS28-CRP, CDAI, or RAPID3. Women were more likely to achieve favorable individual components except for an ESR <30 mm/hr [OR: 0.72 (0.57, 0.90) p<0.01]. Among 353 trial participants, (83.7% women), women had reduced rates of DAS28-ESR remission [OR: 0.39 (0.21, 0.72) p=0.003] but similar rates of low MRI synovitis and osteitis. CONCLUSION: The comparison of remission rates between men and women varies based on the disease activity measure, with sex-specific differences in ESR resulting in reliably lower rates of remission among women. There were no differences in MRI-measures. This article is protected by copyright.

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of computerized working memory training in pediatric brain tumor survivors (PBTS) with cognitive deficits, as well as computerized working memory training that is enhanced with parental problem-solving skills training (PSST). METHODS: Twenty-seven PBTS (ages 7-16) recruited from a large, tertiary academic medical center were randomly assigned to computerized working memory training (Standard; n = 14) or computerized working memory training plus PSST (Combined; n = 13). PBTS completed a baseline assessment and parents completed acceptability surveys. Primary outcomes included number of intervention sessions completed and acceptability ratings. RESULTS: Fourteen of the 27 participants completed at least 20 sessions of the computerized training with average sessions lasting over an hour (M = 68.42 min, SD = 14.63). Completers had significantly better baseline auditory attention abilities than noncompleters. Parents reported both frustration and satisfaction related to the interventions and identified barriers to completing intervention sessions. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot randomized clinical trial raises significant questions related to the feasibility of computerized working memory training in PBTS with cognitive deficits. Findings also offer considerations for integrating family-based treatment approaches into cognitive remediation interventions for PBTS.",Acceptability and Feasibility in a Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial of Computerized Working Memory Training and Parental Problem-Solving Training With Pediatric Brain Tumor Survivors.

"Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), due to mutations in genes of the cohesin protein complex, is described as a disorder of transcriptional regulation. Phenotypes in this expanding field include short stature, microcephaly, intellectual disability, variable facial features and organ involvement, resulting in overlapping presentations, including established syndromes and newly described conditions. Individuals with all forms of CdLS have multifaceted complications, including neurodevelopmental, feeding, craniofacial, and communication. Coping mechanisms and management of challenging behaviors in CdLS, disruption of normal behaviors, and how behavior molds the life of the individual within the family is now better understood. Some psychotropic medications are known to be effective for behavior. Other medications, for example, Indomethacin, are being investigated for effects on gene expression, fetal brain tissue, brain morphology and function in Drosophila, mice, and human fibroblasts containing CdLS-related mutations. Developmental studies have clarified the origin of cardiac defects and role of placenta in CdLS. Chromosome architecture and cohesin complex structure are elucidated, leading to a better understanding of regulatory aspects and controls. As examples, when mutations are present, the formation of loop domains by cohesin, facilitating enhancer-promotor interactions, can be eliminated, and embryologically, the nuclear structure of zygotes is disrupted. Several important genes are now known to interact with cohesin, including Brca2. The following abstracts are from the 8th Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Scientific and Educational Symposium, held in June 2018, Minneapolis, MN, before the CdLS Foundation National Meeting, AMA CME credits provided by GBMC, Baltimore, MD.

"The purpose of this article is to review the role of extrafollicular and T-cell independent antibody responses in humoral immunity. We consider two interrelated questions: (a) do T-cell independent antibody responses dominated by IgM and/or IgA play unique functions in immunity and homeostasis; and (b) is it typical for these responses to result in lifelong protection? In addressing these questions, we consider the established advantages of T-cell driven responses including the unique role played by germinal center reactions in these responses, and contrast the processes and outcomes of germinal center-centric responses with germinal center- and T-cell independent antibodies. We suggest that T-independent and other extrafollicular responses contribute substantially to highly stable antibody repertoires in both the serum and the intestine, providing relatively constitutive humoral barriers with the collective dual function of protecting against invading pathogens and regulating the composition of non-pathogenic microbial communities.",The continuing story of T-cell independent antibodies.
"BACKGROUND: Although musculoskeletal injuries have increased in sub-Saharan Africa, data on the economic burden of non-fatal musculoskeletal injuries in this region are scarce. OBJECTIVE: Socioeconomic costs of orthopedic injuries were estimated by examining both the direct hospital cost of orthopedic care as well as indirect costs of orthopedic trauma using disability days and loss of work as proxies. METHODS: This study surveyed 200 patients seen in the outpatient orthopedic ward of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center, a tertiary hospital in Northeastern Tanzania, during the month of July 2016. FINDINGS: Of the patients surveyed, 88.8% earn a monthly income of less than $250 and the majority of patients (73.7%) reported that the healthcare costs of their musculoskeletal injuries were a catastrophic burden to them and their family with 75.0% of patients reporting their medical costs exceeded their monthly income. The majority (75.3%) of patients lost more than 30 days of activities of daily living due to their injury, with a median (IQR) functional day loss of 90 (30). Post-injury disability led to 40.6% of patients losing their job and 86.7% of disabled patients reported a wage decrease post-injury. There were significant associations between disability and post-injury unemployment (p &lt; .0001) as well as lower post-injury wages (p = .022). CONCLUSION: This exploratory study demonstrates that in this region of the world, access to definitive treatment post-musculoskeletal injury is limited and patients often suffer prolonged disabilities resulting in decreased employment and income.",The Economic Burden of Non-fatal Musculoskeletal Injuries in Northeastern Tanzania.
"STUDY OBJECTIVE: A phase 1/2 clinical trial was performed in individuals with cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficient homocystinuria with aims to: 1) assess pharmacokinetics and safety of taurine therapy 2) evaluate oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular function in CBS deficiency and 3) evaluate the impact of short-term taurine treatment. METHODS: Individuals with pyridoxine-nonresponsive CBS deficiency with homocysteine >50 muM, without inflammatory disorder or on antioxidant therapy were enrolled. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation FMD), and disease-related metabolites obtained at baseline were compared to normal values. While maintaining current treatment, patients were treated with 75 mg/kg taurine twice daily, and treatment response assessed after 4 hours and 4 days. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (8-35 years; 8 males, 6 females) were enrolled with baseline homocysteine levels 161+/-67 muM. The study found high-dose taurine to be safe when excluding preexisting hypertriglyceridemia. Taurine pharmacokinetics showed a rapid peak level returning to near normal levels at 12 hours, but had slow accumulation and elevated predosing levels after 4 days of treatment. Only a single parameter of oxidative stress, 2,3-dinor-iPF2alpha, was elevated at baseline, with no elevated inflammatory parameters, and no change in FMD values overall. Taurine had no effect on any of these parameters. However, the effect of taurine was strongly related to pretreatment FMD values; and taurine significantly improved FMD in the subset of individuals with pretreatment FMD values <10% and in individuals with homocysteine levels >125 muM, pertinent to endothelial function. CONCLUSION: Taurine improves endothelial function in CBS deficient homocystinuria in patients with preexisting reduced function. This article is protected by copyright.

"The global spread of specific clones of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major public health problem, and understanding the dynamics of geographical spread requires worldwide surveillance. Over the past 20 years, the ST239 lineage of MRSA has been recognized as an emerging clone across the globe, with detailed studies focusing on isolates from Europe and Asia. Less is known about this lineage in South America, and, particularly, Brazil where it was the predominant lineage of MRSA in the early 1990s to 2000s. To gain a better understanding about the introduction and spread of ST239 MRSA in Brazil we undertook a comparative phylogenomic analysis of ST239 genomes, adding seven completed, closed Brazilian genomes. Brazilian ST239 isolates grouped in a subtree with those from South American, and Western, romance-language-speaking, European countries, here designated the South American clade. After an initial worldwide radiation in the 1960s and 1970s, we estimate that ST239 began to spread in South America and Brazil in approximately 1988. This clone demonstrates specific genomic changes that are suggestive of local divergence and adaptational change including agrC single-nucleotide polymorphisms variants, and a distinct pattern of virulence-associated genes (mainly the presence of the chp and the absence of sea and sasX). A survey of a geographically and chronologically diverse set of 100 Brazilian ST239 isolates identified this virulence genotype as the predominant pattern in Brazil, and uncovered an unexpectedly high prevalence of agr-dysfunction (30%). ST239 isolates from Brazil also appear to have undergone transposon (IS256) insertions in or near global regulatory genes (agr and mgr) that likely led to rapid reprogramming of bacterial traits. In general, the overall pattern observed in phylogenomic analyses of ST239 is of a rapid initial global radiation, with subsequent local spread and adaptation in multiple different geographic locations. Most ST239 isolates harbor the ardA gene, which we show here to have in vivo anti-restriction activity. We hypothesize that this gene may have improved the ability of this lineage to acquire multiple resistance genes and distinct virulence-associated genes in each local context. The allopatric divergence pattern of ST239 also may suggest strong selective pressures for specific traits in different geographical locations.",Local Diversification of Methicillin- Resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST239 in South America After Its Rapid Worldwide Dissemination.
"Background: The capacity for TMS to elicit neural activity and manipulate cortical excitability has created significant expectation regarding its use in both cognitive and clinical neuroscience. However, the absence of an ability to quantify stimulation effects, particularly outside of the motor cortex, has led clinicians and researchers to pair noninvasive brain stimulation with noninvasive neuroimaging techniques. fNIRS, as an optical and wearable neuroimaging technique, is an ideal candidate for integrated use with TMS. Together, TMS+fNIRS may offer a hybrid alternative to ""blind"" stimulation to assess NIBS in therapy and research. Objective: In this systematic review, the current body of research into the transient and prolonged effects of TMS on fNIRS-based cortical hemodynamic measures while at rest and during tasks are discussed. Additionally, studies investigating the relation of fNIRS to measures of cortical excitability as produced by TMS-evoked Motor-Evoked-Potential (MEP) are evaluated. The aim of this review is to outline the integrated use of TMS+fNIRS and consolidate findings related to use of fNIRS to monitor changes attributed to TMS and the relationship of fNIRS to cortical excitability itself. Methods: Key terms were searched in PubMed and Web-of-Science to identify studies investigating the use of both fNIRS and TMS. Works from Google-Scholar and referenced works in identified papers were also assessed for relevance. All published experimental studies using both fNIRS and TMS techniques in the study methodology were included. Results: A combined literature search of neuroimaging and neurostimulation studies identified 53 papers detailing the joint use of fNIRS and TMS. 22/53 investigated the immediate effects of TMS at rest in the DLPFC and M1 as measured by fNIRS. 21/22 studies reported a significant effect in [HbO] for 40/54 stimulation conditions with 14 resulting an increase and 26 in a decrease. While 15/22 studies also reported [HbR], only 5/37 conditions were significant. Task effects of fNIRS+TMS were detailed in 16 studies, including 10 with clinical populations. Most studies only reported significant changes in [HbO] related measures. Studies comparing fNIRS to changes in MEP-measured cortical excitability suggest that fNIRS measures may be spatially more diffuse but share similar traits. Conclusion: This review summarizes the progress in the development of this emerging hybrid neuroimaging & neurostimulation methodology and its applications. Despite encouraging progress and novel applications, a lack of replicated works, along with highly disparate methodological approaches, highlight the need for further controlled studies. Interpretation of current research directions, technical challenges of TMS+fNIRS, and recommendations regarding future works are discussed.",A Systematic Review of Integrated Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Studies.
"Rho signaling is a conserved mechanism for generating forces through activation of contractile actomyosin. How this pathway can produce different cell morphologies is poorly understood. In the Drosophila embryonic epithelium, we investigate how Rho signaling controls force asymmetry to drive morphogenesis. We study a distinct morphogenetic process termed ""alignment"". This process results in striking columns of rectilinear cells connected by aligned cell-cell contacts. We found that this is driven by contractile actomyosin cables that elevate tension along aligning interfaces. Our data show that polarization of Rho effectors, ROK and Dia, direct formation of these cables. Constitutive activation of these effectors causes aligning cells to instead invaginate. This suggests that moderating Rho signaling is essential to producing the aligned geometry. Therefore, we tested for feedback that could fine-tune Rho signaling. We discovered that F-actin exerts negative feedback on multiple nodes in the pathway. Further, we present evidence that suggests that ROK in part mediates feedback from F-actin to Rho in a Myo-II-independent manner. Collectively, our work suggests that multiple feedback mechanisms regulate Rho signaling, which may account for diverse morphological outcomes.",Multiple feedback mechanisms fine-tune Rho signaling to regulate morphogenetic outcomes.
"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains the top cause of morbidity and mortality of hospitalised patients despite concerted efforts. Clinical decision support for sepsis has shown mixed results reflecting heterogeneous populations, methodologies and interventions. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the addition of a real-time electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical decision support alert improves adherence to treatment guidelines and clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients with suspected severe sepsis. DESIGN: Patient-level randomisation, single blinded. SETTING: Medical and surgical inpatient units of an academic, tertiary care medical centre. PATIENTS: 1123 adults over the age of 18 admitted to inpatient wards (intensive care units (ICU) excluded) at an academic teaching hospital between November 2014 and March 2015. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to either usual care or the addition of an EHR-generated alert in response to a set of modified severe sepsis criteria that included vital signs, laboratory values and physician orders. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in primary outcome of the percentage of patients with new antibiotic orders at 3 hours after the alert (35% vs 37%, p=0.53). There was no difference in secondary outcomes of in-hospital mortality at 30 days, length of stay greater than 72 hours, rate of transfer to ICU within 48 hours of alert, or proportion of patients receiving at least 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids. CONCLUSIONS: An EHR-based severe sepsis alert did not result in a statistically significant improvement in several sepsis treatment performance measures.",Electronic health record-based clinical decision support alert for severe sepsis: a randomised evaluation.

"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Diet may be an important factor in progression of Crohn's disease (CD). We performed a randomized controlled trial to determine whether reduced consumption of red and processed meats decreases the risk of symptomatic relapse of CD, analyzing results from the Food and Crohn's Disease Exacerbation Study (FACES) trial. METHODS: Adults with CD were recruited into the FACES trial from IBD Partners, an internet-based cohort of IBD patients, from November 2013 through June 2015. Individuals who were in remission (CD activity index (sCDAI) scores of 150 or less), had completed a biannual survey, and reported consumption of red meat at least once weekly were randomly assigned to groups that consumed a minimum of 2 servings/week of red or processed meat (high meat, n=118) or not more than 1 serving per month (low meat, n=96) for 49 weeks. The primary outcome was relapse of CD, defined as increase in sCDAI score by >/=70 points and to >150 or a need for CD surgery or new CD medication. A secondary outcome, moderate or severe relapse, was based on an increase in sCDAI to >219 RESULTS: During the trial, the high-meat groups reported consumption of 2 or more servings of red or processed meat during 98.5% of observed weeks compared 18.8% of weeks for the low-meat group. Any and moderate to severe relapse occurred in 62% of participants in the high-meat group and 42% of participants in the low-meat group. There were no significant differences in time to any (P=.61) or moderate/severe (P=.50) relapse. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data from the FACES trial, we found that among patients with CD in remission, level of red and processed meat consumption was not associated with time to symptomatic relapse.

"New advances in intra-arterial (IA) catheters offer clinically proven local interventions in the brain. Here we tested the effect of combining local IA delivery and vascular immunotargeting. Microinjection of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in the brain parenchyma causes cerebral overexpression of Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in mice. Systemic intravenous injection of ICAM-1 antibody (anti-ICAM-1) and anti-ICAM-1/liposomes provided nearly an order of magnitude higher uptake in the inflamed vs normal brain (from ~0.1 to 0.8%ID/g for liposomes). Local injection of anti-ICAM-1 and anti-ICAM-1/liposomes via carotid artery catheter provided an additional respective 2-fold and 5-fold elevation of uptake in the inflamed brain vs levels attained by IV injection. The uptake in the inflamed brain of respective untargeted IgG counterparts was markedly lower (e.g., uptake of anti-ICAM-1/liposomes was 100-fold higher vs IgG/liposomes). These data affirm the specificity of the combined effect of the first pass and immunotargeting. Intravital real-time microscopy via cranial window revealed that anti-ICAM-1/liposomes, but not IgG/liposomes bind to the lumen of blood vessels in the inflamed brain within minutes after injection. This straightforward framework provides the basis for translational efforts towards local vascular drug targeting to the brain.",Combining vascular targeting and the local first pass provides 100-fold higher uptake of ICAM-1-targeted vs untargeted nanocarriers in the inflamed brain.
"SEIPIN deficiency leads to a severe lipodystrophic phenotype with loss of fat tissue. Interestingly, SEIPIN knockout in non-adipocytes is reported to promote intracellular triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear at present. Here, we have shown that SEIPIN knockdown and overexpression exert opposite effects on hepatic lipometabolism. Our experimental data suggest that depletion of SEIPIN induces an increase in intracellular TG via activation of ER stress while its overexpression triggers a decrease in the intracellular TG content via increasing PGC-1alpha, which drives increased mitochondrial activity. Adeno-associated virus-mediated SEIPIN overexpression alleviated high fat diet-induced hepatosteatosis in mice. The collective results indicate that the effects of SEIPIN on TG and PGC-1alpha are dependent on calcium concentrations, signifying regulatory activity on hepatic lipometabolism through alterations in the intracellular calcium level, and support the potential utility of modulating intracellular SEIPIN and calcium levels as novel therapeutic strategies for fatty liver.",SEIPIN overexpression in the liver may alleviate hepatic steatosis by influencing the intracellular calcium level.
"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the intraoperative deployment of a pre-loaded probe for a ""pushed"" monocanalicular nasolacrimal intubation. STUDY DESIGN: Non-randomized study of consecutive cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Description: A classical Monoka silicone stent with the silicone tube attached at right angles to the punctal plug is contained entirely inside an introducer connected to a piston. Insertion: The procedure begins with intubation of the nasolacrimal duct with the metallic introducer. Traction on the piston retracts the metallic introducer inside the handpiece. This relative shortening progressively ejects the stent, starting with its free end at the bottom of the introducer. The operation was observed endoscopically under single-blind conditions. RESULTS: Twenty-eight preloaded Monoka stents were placed consecutively, in 28 congenital nasolacrimal duct intubations in 22 patients (28 sides). Endoscopic examination showed that the free part of the stent was progressively ejected from the introducer during retraction of the piston. Insertion of this pushed stent into the nasal cavity was effective in 23/28 cases (82.1%). A total of 28 preloaded stent insertions were attempted and 23 were correctly deployed. DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED: At the end of nasolacrimal duct intubation, contact between the punctal plug and the lacrimal punctum was problematic in four cases (4/28=14.2%). At the beginning of stent placement, premature ejection of the punctal plug within the end of the introducer occurred in five cases (5/28=17.8%). These five stents failed to insert properly into the nasal cavity. At the end of insertion, retention of the punctal plug in the introducer occurred in two cases (2/28=7.1%). COMPLICATIONS: No cases of intraoperative or postoperative epistaxis were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative nasal endoscopy validated the concept of the preloaded Monoka stent and its deployment. Reproducibility and improved reliability may require a change in stenting technique and a design modification.",Insertion of a preloaded Monoka stent for congenital nasolacrimal obstruction: Intraoperative observations.

"SETTING: Diagnosing pediatric tuberculosis (TB) is difficult; to improve diagnosis, gastric aspiration (GA) was performed in 121 Botswana health facilities. OBJECTIVE: To describe treatment initiation and outcomes in children with a positive GA result and those treated empirically. METHODS: Children with smear or culture-positive GA or those clinically diagnosed were referred for anti-tuberculosis treatment. Treatment initiation and outcomes were assessed from February 2008 to December 2012 using name-based matching algorithms of the GA database; treatment initiation was captured in the electronic TB registry. Analyses included descriptive statistics and regression models. RESULTS: GA was conducted in 1268 children. Among these, 121 (9.5%) were GA-positive; and treatment was initiated in 90 (74.3%). An additional 137 (11.9%) were treated empirically. More than a third (36.4%) had known human immunodeficiency virus status (positive or negative); this was significantly associated with TB treatment initiation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.8, 95%CI 1.3-2.5); P < 0.05). Among the 90 children with a positive GA result, nearly all either completed treatment (78.9%) or were on treatment (20.0%) at the time of data collection. CONCLUSION: We could not find documentation of treatment for more than a quarter of the children with laboratory-confirmed TB, an important gap that calls for further examination. The failure to initiate prompt treatment requires investigation and urgent action.","Initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment in children following gastric aspirate testing, Botswana, 2008-2012."
"Background Despite improvements on individual process of care measures for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), little is known about performance on a composite measure of AMI care that assesses the delivery of many components of high-quality AMI care. We sought to examine trends in patient- and hospital-level performance on a composite defect-free care measure, identify disparities in the performance across sociodemographic groups, and identify opportunities to further improve quality and outcomes. Methods and Results We calculated the proportion of patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry-Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With The Guidelines (now known as the Chest Pain - Myocardial Infarction Registry) between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, receiving defect-free AMI care including guideline-recommended pharmacotherapy, timely provision of medical and reperfusion therapy, assessment of ventricular function, referral to cardiac rehabilitation, and smoking cessation counseling for patients with AMI. A total of 522 800 patients at 222 hospitals were included. Overall, the proportion of patients receiving defect-free care significantly increased from 66.0% in 2010 to 77.1% in 2017 ( P<0.001). Improvements in performance were observed across all sociodemographic subgroups, with the greatest absolute improvement observed for black and Hispanic patients ( P<0.001). However, absolute performance was consistently lower among older patients, women, black and Hispanic patients, and those with government insurance in 2017 ( P<0.001 for all). Improvements in care and reduced variation in performance were observed at the hospital level overall (2010, median [IQR] 67.2% [40.7%-76.3%]; 2017, median [IQR] 80.7% [73.1%-88.1%]; P<0.001) as well as across region, safety net status, teaching status, and proportion of patients who are nonwhite and have Medicaid insurance coverage ( P<0.001 for all). Conclusions Despite improvements in the proportion of patients with AMI receiving defect-free care overall and across sociodemographic groups, nearly 1 in 4 patients in 2017 still did not receive optimal care and absolute performance was consistently lower among older patients, women, black, and Hispanic patients. Composite measures of cardiovascular care, which assess the delivery of several evidence-based processes of care, can illuminate opportunities to improve the quality of care beyond that provided by conventional process measures.",Trends in Performance and Opportunities for Improvement on a Composite Measure of Acute Myocardial Infarction Care.

"Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (PCD) is caused by bi-allelic mutations of the PC gene. The reported clinical spectrum includes a neonatal form with early death (type B), an infantile fatal form (type A), and an late onset form with isolated mild intellectual delay (type C). Apart from homozygous stop-codon mutations leading to type B PCD, a genotype-phenotype correlation has not otherwise been discernible. Indeed, patients harboring bi-allelic heterozygous variants leading to PC activity near zero can present either with a fatal infantile type A or with a benign late onset type C form. In this study, we analyzed six novel patients with type A (three) and type C (three) PCD, and compared them with previously reported cases. Firstly, we observed that type C PCD is not associated to homozygous variants in PC. In-silico modeling was used to map former and novel variants associated to type A and C PCD, and to predict their potential effects on the enzyme structure and function. We found that variants lead to type A or type C phenotype based on the destabilization between the two major enzyme conformers. In general, our study on novel and previously reported patients improves the overall understanding on type A and C PCD. This article is protected by copyright.

"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy is increasingly used in the pediatric population, in particular among children with immune-compromising conditions. Pooled immunoglobulin products are routinely tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and nucleic acid, however screening for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) is not commonly performed. Thus, the administration of IVIg containing anti-HBc to children with immune-compromising conditions may complicate the interpretation of hepatitis B serologic testing in that a positive anti-HBc test may represent passive transfer of antibody from IVIg or may indicate resolved or chronic hepatitis B infection. Due to the risk of hepatitis B reactivation in immunocompromised patients, a positive anti-HBc test must be carefully considered. As part of a quality improvement initiative, we identified and reviewed the records of all pediatric patients at our institution who tested positive for anti-HBc over an 18-month period. Of 44 total patients with positive anti-HBc tests, we found that 22 (50%) had previously received IVIg in the preceding 4 months. All but one of these, 21/22 (95%), went on to receive immunosuppressive therapy (IS). Among the patients who received IS, 19 (86%) had not undergone hepatitis B serologic testing prior to IVIg administration and 16 (73%) did not have subsequent testing to distinguish between passive acquisition of anti-HBc from IVIg and chronic hepatitis B infection. Our single-center experience reveals that a high proportion of positive anti-HBc tests in children are presumed to be due to passive antibody transfer from IVIg. However, a low proportion of patients undergo confirmatory testing, despite the risk of hepatitis B reactivation during IS. We thus propose a risk-based algorithm for interpretation and monitoring of hepatitis B testing in immunocompromised children. This article is protected by copyright.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The diagnosis of gastric neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is being made with increased frequency likely as a result of more upper endoscopies being done for unrelated reasons. It is therefore vital that gastroenterologists become familiar with the basic work-up and management of patients found to have these tumors. This review describes the classification, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment options of the different gastric NETs. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to the three traditional subtypes of gastric NETs, additional cases associated with achlorhydria and appropriate hypergastrinemia may exist. The management of gastric NETs between 1 and 2 cm in size remains controversial and needs to be individualized. Gastric NETs are uncommon but are now diagnosed more frequently. This review highlights the role of hypergastrinemia in their development and the controversies around their management.",Gastric Neuroendocrine Tumors (Carcinoids).
"Enthusiasm for the use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in cancer therapy has risen over the past few years. The success of this therapeutic approach relies on the identification of cell surface antigens that are widely and selectively expressed on tumor cells. Studies have shown that native ALK protein is expressed on the surface of most neuroblastoma cells, providing an opportunity for development of immune-targeting strategies. Clinically relevant antibodies for this target have not yet been developed. Here, we describe the development of an ALK-ADC, CDX-0125-TEI, which selectively targets both wild-type and mutated ALK-expressing neuroblastomas. CDX-0125-TEI exhibited efficient antigen binding and internalization, and cytotoxicity at picomolar concentrations in cells with different expression of ALK on the cell surface. In vivo studies showed that CDX-0125-TEI is effective against ALK wild-type and mutant patient-derived xenograft models. These data demonstrate that ALK is a bona fide immunotherapeutic target and provide a rationale for clinical development of an ALK-ADC approach for neuroblastomas and other ALK-expressing childhood cancers such as rhabdomyosarcomas.",An antibody-drug conjugate directed to the ALK receptor demonstrates efficacy in preclinical models of neuroblastoma.
"BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and cancer death. Recurrent cancers arise from the pool of residual tumor cells, or minimal residual disease (MRD), that survives primary treatment and persists in the host. Whether the association of obesity with recurrence risk is causal is unknown, and the impact of obesity on MRD and breast cancer recurrence has not been reported in humans or in animal models. METHODS: Doxycycline-inducible primary mammary tumors were generated in intact MMTV-rtTA;TetO-HER2/neu (MTB/TAN) mice or orthotopic recipients fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) or a control low-fat diet (LFD; 10% kcal from fat). Following oncogene downregulation and tumor regression, mice were followed for clinical recurrence. Body weight was measured twice weekly and used to segregate HFD mice into obese (i.e., responders) and lean (i.e., nonresponders) study arms, and obesity was correlated with body fat percentage, glucose tolerance (measured using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests), serum biomarkers (measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and tissue transcriptomics (assessed by RNA sequencing). MRD was quantified by droplet digital PCR. RESULTS: HFD-Obese mice weighed significantly more than HFD-Lean and LFD control mice (p < 0.001) and had increased body fat percentage (p < 0.001). Obese mice exhibited fasting hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and impaired glucose tolerance, as well as decreased serum levels of adiponectin and increased levels of leptin, resistin, and insulin-like growth factor 1. Tumor recurrence was accelerated in HFD-Obese mice compared with HFD-Lean and LFD control mice (median relapse-free survival 53.0 days vs. 87.0 days vs. 80.0 days, log-rank p < 0.001; HFD-Obese compared with HFD-Lean HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.52-4.16; HFD-Obese compared with LFD HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.42-3.63). HFD-Obese mice harbored a significantly greater number of residual tumor cells than HFD-Lean and LFD mice (12,550 +/- 991 vs. 7339 +/- 2182 vs. 4793 +/- 1618 cells, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These studies provide a genetically engineered mouse model for study of the association of diet-induced obesity with breast cancer recurrence. They demonstrate that this model recapitulates physiological changes characteristic of obese patients, establish that the association between obesity and recurrence risk is causal in nature, and suggest that obesity is associated with the increased survival and persistence of residual tumor cells.",Impact of obesity on breast cancer recurrence and minimal residual disease.
"As the biological bridge between mother and fetus, the placenta is not only important for the health of the mother and fetus during pregnancy but it also impacts the lifelong health of the fetus. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) involve procedures and exposures that are not characteristic of in vivo reproduction. Moreover, ART procedures occur when the gametes and embryos are undergoing extensive epigenetic reprogramming. Thus, the oxidative, thermal, and mechanical stress that ART procedures introduce can impact the biological processes of placental growth, development, and function with potentially long-lasting health effects for the offspring. Here, we focus on the placenta and summarize the clinical, morphological, and molecular outcomes of ART. This review highlights that ART procedures have additive effects on placental morphology as well as epigenetic disturbances and provides a foundation for reconceptualizing ART outcomes.","Assisted Reproductive Technologies and the Placenta: Clinical, Morphological, and Molecular Outcomes."
"CONTEXT.-: There has been a rapid expansion of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assays for the detection of somatic variants in solid tumors. However, limited data are available regarding the comparative performance of NGS and non-NGS assays using standardized samples across a large number of laboratories. OBJECTIVE.-: To compare the performance of NGS and non-NGS assays using well-characterized proficiency testing samples provided by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Molecular Oncology Committee. A secondary goal was to compare the use of preanalytic and postanalytic practices. DESIGN.-: A total of 17,343 responses were obtained from participants in the BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, and the Multigene Tumor Panel surveys across 84 different proficiency testing samples interrogating 16 variants and 3 wild-type sequences. Performance and preanalytic/postanalytic practices were analyzed by method. RESULTS.-: While both NGS and non-NGS achieved an acceptable response rate of greater than 95%, the overall performance of NGS methods was significantly better than that of non-NGS methods for the identification of variants in BRAF (overall 97.8% versus 95.6% acceptable responses, P = .001) and EGFR (overall 98.5% versus 97.3%, P = .01) and was similar for KRAS (overall 98.8% and 97.6%, P = .10). There were specific variant differences, but in all discrepant cases, NGS methods outperformed non-NGS methods. NGS laboratories also more consistently used preanalytic and postanalytic practices suggested by the CAP checklist requirements than non-NGS laboratories. CONCLUSIONS.-: The overall analytic performance of both methods was excellent. For specific BRAF and EGFR variants, NGS outperformed non-NGS methods and NGS laboratories report superior adherence to suggested laboratory practices.","Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Methods Show Superior or Equivalent Performance to Non-NGS Methods on BRAF, EGFR, and KRAS Proficiency Testing Samples."

"Packed red blood cells are a critical component in the resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock. The availability of donor-derived blood products, however, suffers from issues of supply, immunogenicity, and pathogenic contamination. Deployment in remote or austere environments, such as the battlefield, is further hindered by the inherent perishability of blood products. In order to address the significant limitations of allogenic packed red blood cells and the urgent medical need for better resuscitative therapies for both combat casualties and civilians, there has been significant research invested in developing safe, effective, and field deployable artificial oxygen carriers.

"INTRODUCTION: Experts of pediatric endosurgery recommend early thoracoscopic resection of congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM) even in asymptomatic infants due to the risk of later infections. However, neither the rate of lower airway inflammation nor the underlying microbes and their pathogenic potential have been revealed in CPAMs yet. Using latest gene-sequencing techniques, we present the first study analyzing the pulmonary microbiome in young asymptomatic infants with CPAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven asymptomatic infants (age 2-3 months) underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy for CPAM. Preoperatively, blood test was taken to rule out systemic infections. Surgical specimen was screened and graded for local inflammation by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) histology. The pulmonary microbiome and mycobiome were assessed using next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Preoperatively, all infants had normal white blood cell counts and normal C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Microbial evidence was found in 4/7 patients, 3 being bacteria (Pseudomonas twice, Streptococcus sp. once) and 1 fungal species (Pneumocystis jirovecii, mostly known from immunosuppressed patients, and Preussia funiculata). Histologically, both Pseudomonas and fungi were associated with low and intermediate pulmonary inflammation, whereas Streptococcus was negative for leucocyte infiltration. CONCLUSION: For the first time ever this study revealed genetic evidence of pathogenic microbes in 4/7 CPAMs causing lower airway inflammation in 3/7 asymptomatic young infants. Especially pseudomonas and fungi represent considerable pathogenic potential and call for a broader, age-dependent, multicenter study of CPAMs. Such data could be important for pediatric surgeons counseling parents about the necessity and timing of thoracoscopic resections.",Microbial Evidence in Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformations of Young Asymptomatic Infants.
"The extent to which sports injuries contribute to the burden of injury among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is unknown. The goal of this study was to estimate the incidence of sports injuries among adolescents in Africa. Data from the World Health Organization Global School-Based Student Health surveys were used to estimate the annual number of African adolescents sustaining sports injuries. Gender-stratified injury rates were calculated and applied to every African country's adolescent population to estimate country-specific and continent-wide injury totals. A total of 21,858 males and 24,691 females from 14 countries were included in the analysis. Country-specific annual sports injury rates ranged from 13.5% to 38.1% in males and 5.2% to 20.2% in females. Weighted average sports injury rates for males and females were 23.7% (95% CI 23.1%-24.2%) and 12.5% (95% CI 12.1%-12.9%), respectively. When these rates were extrapolated to the adolescent populations of the African continent, an estimated 15,477,798 (95% CI 15,085,955-15,804,333) males and 7,943,625 (95% CI 7,689,429-8,197,821) females sustained sports injuries. Our findings suggest that over 23 million African adolescents sustained sports injuries annually. Further work will help to more precisely define the burden of sports injuries in LMICs and the role that surgery can play in mitigating this burden.",An Estimation of the Burden of Sports Injuries among African Adolescents.
"Hair follicles (HFs) are a wellcharacterized niche for adult stem cells (SCs), and include epithelial and melanocytic SCs. HF cells are an accessible source of multipotent adult SCs for the generation of the interfollicular epidermis, HF structures and sebaceous glands in addition to the reconstitution of novel HFs in vivo. In the present study, it was demonstrated that HF cells are able to be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytelike cells in vitro under specific conditions. It was determined that HF cells cultured on OP9 feeder cells in KnockOutDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/B27 in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factors differentiated into cardiomyocytelike cells that express markers specific to cardiac lineage, but do not express noncardiac lineage markers including neural stem/progenitor cell, HF bulge cells or undifferentiated spermatogonia markers. These cardiomyocytelike cells exhibited a spindle and filamentshaped morphology similar to that presented by cardiac muscles and exhibited spontaneous beating that persisted for over 3 months. These results demonstrate that SC reprogramming and differentiation may be induced without resulting in any genetic modification, which is important for the clinical applications of SCs including tissue and organ regeneration.",Induction of cardiomyocytelike cells from hair follicle cells in mice.
"Precision medicine, an approach for disease treatment and prevention that considers ""individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle"" 1 was endorsed by the National Institutes of Health, aided by the presidential Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), in 2016. PMI provided funding for cancer research and for building a national cohort of one million or more U.S. participants, now known as the ""All of Us"" Research Program, which aims to expand its impact to all diseases. PMI was the catalyst to a widespread effort around precision medicine, as evidenced by the more than 1000 grants funded by different NIH institutes in just the last two years. The data being generated by these efforts is growing exponentially, and becomes both the greatest treasure and the greatest challenge for researchers.

"The link between cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders has been widely observed in the aging population. Disease prevention and treatment rely on understanding the potential genetic nexus of multiple diseases in these categories. In this study, we were interested in detecting pleiotropy, or the phenomenon in which a genetic variant influences more than one phenotype. Marker-phenotype association approaches can be grouped into univariate, bivariate, and multivariate categories based on the number of phenotypes considered at one time. Here we applied one statistical method per category followed by an eQTL colocalization analysis to identify potential pleiotropic variants that contribute to the link between cardiovascular and neurological diseases. We performed our analyses on ~530,000 common SNPs coupled with 65 electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotypes in 43,870 unrelated European adults from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. There were 31 variants identified by all three methods that showed significant associations across late onset cardiac- and neurologic- diseases. We further investigated functional implications of gene expression on the detected ""lead SNPs"" via colocalization analysis, providing a deeper understanding of the discovered associations. In summary, we present the framework and landscape for detecting potential pleiotropy using univariate, bivariate, multivariate, and colocalization methods. Further exploration of these potentially pleiotropic genetic variants will work toward understanding disease causing mechanisms across cardiovascular and neurological diseases and may assist in considering disease prevention as well as drug repositioning in future research.","Detecting potential pleiotropy across cardiovascular and neurological diseases using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate methods on 43,870 individuals from the eMERGE network."
"Background: This study explored a simple, high-yield method for isolating quiescent human pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) to provide sufficient and reliable raw materials for PSC-related studies. Materials and methods: Single-cell suspensions were prepared from normal human pancreatic tissue specimens using the gentleMACS() tissue processor, which enhanced the yield and viability of the suspensions. Percoll density gradient centrifugation was then performed to isolate quiescent normal PSCs (NPSCs). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining, and the states of the NPSCs were determined by autofluorescence and oil red O staining. The purity of human activated PSCs (APSCs) was determined by immunofluorescence assays. Results: The yield of NPSCs was ~(2.75+/-0.65)x10(6) cells/g. The maximum cell viability was 92%, whereas the maximum cell purity was 95%. Conclusion: The method employed in this study to isolate PSCs is a simple, high-yield and stable method that is worth popularizing.",A modified method for isolating human quiescent pancreatic stellate cells.
"Alcohol use contributes to numerous diseases and injuries. The nervous system is affected by alcohol in diverse ways, though the molecular mechanisms of these effects are not clearly understood. Using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we developed a neural cell culture model to identify the mechanisms of alcohol's effects. iPSCs were generated from fibroblasts and differentiated into forebrain neural cells cultures that were treated with 50 mM alcohol or sham conditions (same media lacking alcohol) for 7 days. We analyzed gene expression using total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for 34 samples derived from 10 subjects and for 10 samples from 5 subjects in an independent experiment that had intermittent exposure to the same dose of alcohol. We also analyzed genetic effects on gene expression and conducted a weighted correlation network analysis. We found that differentiated neural cell cultures have the capacity to recapitulate gene regulatory effects previously observed in specific primary neural tissues and identified 226 genes that were differentially expressed (FDR < 0.1) after alcohol treatment. The effects on expression included decreases in INSIG1 and LDLR, two genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. We also identified a module of 58 co-expressed genes that were uniformly decreased following alcohol exposure. The majority of these effects were supported in independent alcohol exposure experiments. Enrichment analysis linked the alcohol responsive genes to cell cycle, notch signaling, and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways, which are disrupted in several neurological disorders. Our findings suggest that there is convergence between these disorders and the effects of alcohol exposure.",Alcohol-responsive genes identified in human iPSC-derived neural cultures.
"Current methods to evaluate effects of kinase inhibitors in cancer are suboptimal. Analysis of changes in cancer metabolism in response to the inhibitors creates an opportunity for better understanding of the interplay between cell signaling and metabolism and, from the translational perspective, potential early evaluation of response to the inhibitors as well as treatment optimization. We performed genomic, metabolomic and fluxomic analyses to evaluate the mechanism of action of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib (IBR) in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells. Our comprehensive analysis of the data generated by these diverse technologies revealed that IBR profoundly affected key metabolic pathways in IBR-sensitive cells including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle and glutaminolysis while having much less effects on IBR-poorly responsive cells. Changes in 1H MRS-detectable lactate and alanine concentrations emerged as promising biomarkers of response and resistance to IBR as demonstrated from experiments on various MCL cell lines. The metabolic network analysis on the 13C MRS and 13C LC-MS experimental data provided quantitative estimates of various intracellular fluxes and energy contributions. Glutaminolysis contributed over 50% of mitochondrial ATP production. Administration of the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 induced growth suppression of the IBR-poorly responsive cells. Implications: Our study demonstrates application of the advanced metabolomic/fluxomic techniques for comprehensive, precise and prompt evaluations of the effects of kinase inhibition in MCL cells and has strong translational implications by potentially permitting early evaluation of cancer patient response vs resistance to kinase inhibitors and on design of novel therapies for overcoming the resistance.",Metabolic Detection of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition in Mantle Cell Lymphoma Cells.
"OBJECTIVES: Interest in linking patients with unmet social needs to area-level resources, such as food pantries and employment centres in one's ZIP code, is growing. However, whether the presence of these resources is associated with better health outcomes is unclear. We sought to determine if area-level resources, defined as organisations that assist individuals with meeting health-related social needs, are associated with lower levels of cardiometabolic risk factors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Data were collected in a primary care network in eastern Massachusetts in 2015. PARTICIPANTS AND PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: 123 355 participants were included. The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI). The secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). All participants were included in BMI analyses. Participants with hypertension were included in SBP analyses. Participants with an indication for cholesterol lowering were included in LDL analyses and participants with diabetes mellitus were included in HbA1c analyses. We used a random forest-based machine-learning algorithm to identify types of resources associated with study outcomes. We then tested the association of ZIP-level selected resource types (three for BMI, two each for SBP and HbA1c analyses and one for LDL analyses) with these outcomes, using multilevel models to account for individual-level, clinic-level and other area-level factors. RESULTS: Resources associated with lower BMI included more food resources (-0.08 kg/m(2) per additional resource, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.03 kg/m(2)), employment resources (-0.05 kg/m(2), 95% CI -0.11 to -0.002 kg/m(2)) and nutrition resources (-0.07 kg/m(2), 95% CI -0.13 to -0.01 kg/m(2)). No area resources were associated with differences in SBP, LDL or HbA1c. CONCLUSIONS: Access to specific local resources is associated with better BMI. Efforts to link patients to area resources, and to improve the resources landscape within communities, may help reduce BMI and improve population health.",Association between access to social service resources and cardiometabolic risk factors: a machine learning and multilevel modeling analysis.
"INTRODUCTION: The management of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) relies on their early identification, allowing adjustment of antiparkinsonian treatment before these manifestations lead to major social, financial or legal consequences. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) is an English-developed and -validated PD-specific rating scale constructed to support the rating of ICDs and related disorders and the assessment of changes in symptom severity over time, but it has not to date been validated in French. METHODS: We conducted an observational, multicenter, cross-sectional study among a subset of patients (n=280) from the Drug Interacting with Genes in PD (DIG-PD) cohort, aiming to assess psychometric properties of the French version of QUIP-RS: acceptability, internal consistency, factor analysis, reproductibility and hypotheses testing. In addition to this scale, the following measures were applied: MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, Frontal Assessment Behavior, and Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease (ASBPD). RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.72 and ranged from 0.25 to 0.55. Regarding test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability, the Lin concordance coefficient for items was higher than 0.58. The correlations between QUIP-RS and ASBPD were moderate to high except for dopaminergic addiction and hobbyism (r=0.41 and 0.40 respectively, p<0.001). No clinically significant correlation was found between QUIP-RS total score (and items) and other scales. CONCLUSION: The French version of the QUIP-RS appears to be a valid, reliable, and precise instrument for the assessment of ICDs and related disorders in PD.

"Cadherins play a major role in mediating cell-cell adhesion, which shares many parallels with platelet-platelet interactions during aggregate formation and clot stabilization. Platelets express epithelial (E)-cadherin, but its contribution to platelet function and/or platelet production is currently unknown. To assess the role of E-cadherin in platelet production and function in vitro and in vivo, we utilized a megakaryocyte-specific E-cadherin knockout mouse model. Loss of E-cadherin in megakaryocytes does not affect megakaryocyte maturation, platelet number or size. However, platelet dysfunction in the absence of E-cadherin is revealed when conditional knockout mice are challenged with acute antibody-mediated platelet depletion. Unlike wild-type mice that recover fully, knockout mice die within 72 hours post-antibody administration, likely from haemorrhage. Furthermore, conditional knockout mice have prolonged tail bleeding times, unstable clot formation, reduced clot retraction and reduced fibrin deposition in in vivo injury models. Murine platelet aggregation in vitro in response to thrombin and thrombin receptor activating peptide is compromised in E-cadherin null platelets, while aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is not significantly different. Consistent with this, in vitro aggregation of primary human platelets in response to thrombin is decreased by an inhibitory E-cadherin antibody. Integrin activation and granule secretion in response to ADP and thrombin are not affected in E-cadherin null platelets, but Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) activation are attenuated, suggesting a that E-cadherin contributes to aggregation, clot stabilization and retraction that is mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/GSK3beta signalling. In summary, E-cadherin plays a salient role in platelet aggregation and clot stability.",Epithelial (E)-Cadherin is a Novel Mediator of Platelet Aggregation and Clot Stability.
"BACKGROUND: In an effort to mitigate the major morbidities and mortality associated with extreme prematurity, we have developed an EXTrauterine Environment for Neonatal Development (EXTEND) designed to provide physiologic support of extremely premature infants. OBJECTIVES: We have previously shown that long-term, physiologic support of premature fetal lambs is possible with EXTEND, but in this study, we sought to demonstrate bioenergetic equipoise at the tissue level. METHODS: Four premature fetal lambs were delivered by hysterotomy at gestational ages (GA) of 105-107 days (term approximately 145 days), cannulated via the umbilical vessels, and transitioned to support on EXTEND for 3-4 weeks. Five control fetuses were age-matched to the GA of experimental fetuses at the time of study end (128-134 days GA) and immediately sacrificed after hysterotomy. Mitochondria were isolated from the heart, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle of fetuses at the time of sacrifice, and oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) were measured. RESULTS: There were no differences in basal mitochondrial OCR between EXTEND and control fetuses for heart, kidney, or skeletal muscle. For liver, the basal OCR was higher in EXTEND fetuses compared to controls. There were no differences in physiologic maximal OCR or reserve capacity for any tissue analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal lambs supported by EXTEND demonstrate physiologic mitochondrial function as evidenced by adequate basal and physiologic maximal cellular respiration as well as preserved reserve capacity.",Premature Lambs Exhibit Normal Mitochondrial Respiration after Long-Term Extrauterine Support.
"OBJECTIVES: Antidepressants may be less effective in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In this exploratory study, we examined the widely held hypothesis that monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy may be superior to tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) therapy for TRD. We also examined the influence of the number of prior treatment trials on TCA versus MAOI effectiveness in TRD. METHODS: Data were retrospectively extracted from approximately 2,500 treatment charts of patients with TRD who were attending a university mood disorder clinic between 1983 and 2015. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the efficacy of drug class on outcome as well as the interaction between drug class and the number of prior antidepressant trials. RESULTS: 147 treatment outcome observations were made from 94 unipolar, depressed patients who either received TCA (N=47) or MAOI (N=100) monotherapy for TRD. For patients unresponsive to at least one prior trial, drug class significantly predicted end-of-treatment CGI/S scores, with TCAs showing worse (i.e., higher) end-of-treatment CGI/S scores relative to MAOI therapy (b=1.04, t=4.98, p < 0.0001). When examining the interaction between drug class and the number of prior antidepressant trials, the interaction effect was significant (b = -0.50, t = -2.43, p=0.02); however, the advantage for MAOI versus TCA therapy decreases with more prior, failed, antidepressant trials. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that MAOIs may be more effective than TCAs for early stage TRD. This difference in effectiveness between MAOIs and TCAs diminished as the number of prior treatment trials increased. However, the TCA sample size was limited and the analysis was retrospective with non-randomized conditions.",Relative effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressant versus monoamine oxidase inhibitor monotherapy for treatment-resistant depression.
"Studies of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in CLL have demonstrated the potential to produce deep remissions - and possibly cures - in some patients with heavily pre-treated, high risk, relapsed and refractory disease. Unfortunately, most clinical trials of CAR T cells in CLL report complete responses only in the minority of patients, although recent studies have begun to elucidate the factors most predictive of response. These studies have suggested strategies for optimizing CAR T cell fitness as well as the pre-existing host immune response, approaches that will likely lead to improvements in the efficacy of CAR T cells in CLL. Treating patients earlier in the course of their disease, or using combination therapies with CAR T cells may further enhance efficacy. In this review, we summarize the existing literature on CAR T cell therapy in CLL, discuss mechanisms of response and resistance, and describe challenges facing the field.

"A chart review was performed of 38 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by 3 years of age at an inner-city developmental program who subsequently experienced resolution of ASD symptomatology and no longer met diagnostic criteria for ASD at follow-up an average of 4 years later. Demographic, developmental/cognitive data, Childhood Autism Rating Scale, and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule data as available were reviewed from the initial diagnostic evaluation and at the time of follow-up. Services received by the children between the time of diagnosis and follow-up, educational setting at the time of follow-up, and emotional/behavioral and learning diagnoses made by the multidisciplinary team at follow-up were reviewed. The findings indicate that residual emotional/behavioral and learning problems were present at follow-up in the vast majority of children in this group and that the majority continued to require educational support.","When an Early Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder Resolves, What Remains?"
"Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor (PFT) is a rare neoplasm of mesenchymal origin that can be identified by its propensity for children and adolescents combined with a characteristic histologic arrangement of histiocytes and osteoclast-like giant cells whorled within tumor islands. A 5-year-old female presented with a raised, intermittently tender, and slowly enlarging tumor on her chest, which was histologically confirmed to be a PFT. We present this case along with a comprehensive review of PFT cases reported in the literature to describe the demographic, histologic, and rarely metastatic behavior of this entity.

"Decades of research have established that racial ethnic minority, low-income, and/or non-English speaking children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are diagnosed later than white children, and their families experience greater difficulty accessing services in the USA. Delayed access to timely diagnosis and early intervention may impact child outcomes and family quality of life. Despite their cognition of these disparities and their significant impact on the lives of those affected, explanations for the barriers experienced by underserved families are elusive, likely due to the complex interaction between structural and family factors. This study used qualitative methods to gather family and provider perspectives of perceived barriers and facilitators to obtaining an ASD diagnosis and accessing ASD-related services for underserved families. Themes from focus groups and interviews with families from three cultural groups (black, Hispanic/Latino, and Korean) and three primary languages (English, Korean, and Spanish) highlight specific barriers related to family, community, and systemic challenges as well as facilitators to accessing care for these populations. Family experiences are expanded upon with viewpoints from the providers who work with them. Recommendations are made for reducing disparities in the existing ASD service system including increasing professional, family, and community education; increasing culturally responsive care; improving provider-family partnerships; and addressing practical challenges to service access.",Caregiver Voices: Cross-Cultural Input on Improving Access to Autism Services.
"Background: Orofacial clefting (OFC) is the most common developmental craniofacial malformation, and causal etiologies largely remain unknown. The opioid crisis has led to a large proportion of infants recovering from neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to in-utero narcotics exposure. We sought to characterize the prevalence of OFC in infants with NAS. Methods: This cohort study analyzed live births at our institution from 2013 to 2017 to identify any association between OFC and NAS. Results: Prevalence of OFC was 6.79 and 1.63 (per 1,000 live births) in the NAS and general population, respectively. Odds ratios for NAS patients having developed OFC, isolated cleft palate, isolated cleft lip, and combined cleft lip and palate compared with the general population were found to be 4.18 (P = 0.001), 5.92 (P = 0.001), 3.79 (P = 0.05), and 2.94 (P = 0.35), respectively. Analyses performed comparing the NAS and general populations to control for potential confounding variables influencing the NAS population yielded no significant differences with exception of in-utero exposure to physician prescribed opioids. Conclusions: Prevalence of OFC in infants with NAS was higher than the general live birth population. Isolated cleft palate and isolated cleft lip, specifically, were significantly more prevalent in NAS patients compared with the general population and were associated with in-utero opioid exposure.",Associations between Orofacial Clefting and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.
"Pioneering gene therapy trials have shown that the genetic engineering of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells can be an alternative to allogeneic transplantation in the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies. Early trials also highlighted the risk of insertional mutagenesis and oncogene transactivation associated with the first generation of gammaretroviral vectors. These events prompted the development of safer, self-inactivating lentiviral or gammaretroviral vectors. These lentiviral vectors have been successfully used to treat over 200 patients with 10 different haematological disorders (including primary immunodeficiencies, haemoglobinopathies and metabolic disorders) and for the generation of chimeric antigen receptor-T cells for cancer therapy. However, several challenges, such as effective reconstitution during inflammation, remain if gene therapy is to be extended to more complex diseases in which haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells can be altered by the disease environment. We discuss the progress made and future challenges for gene therapy and contrast gene therapy with gene-editing strategies.",Gene therapy targeting haematopoietic stem cells for inherited diseases: progress and challenges.

"Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells comprise a unique lineage of CD1d-restricted lipid-reactive T lymphocytes that potently kill tumor cells and exhibit robust immunostimulatory functions. Optimal tumor-directed iNKT cell responses often require expression of the antigen-presenting molecule CD1d on tumors; however, many tumor cells downregulate CD1d and thus evade iNKT cell recognition. We generated a soluble bispecific fusion protein designed to direct iNKT cells to the site of B-cell cancers in a tumor antigen-specific but CD1d-independent manner. This fusion protein is composed of a human CD1d molecule joined to a single chain antibody FV fragment specific for CD19, an antigen widely expressed on B-cell cancers. The CD1d-CD19 fusion protein binds specifically to CD19-expressing, but not CD19-negative cells. Once loaded with the iNKT cell lipid agonist alpha-galactosyl ceramide (alphaGC), the CD1d-CD19 fusion induces robust in vitro activation of and cytokine production by human iNKT cells. iNKT cells stimulated by the alphaGC-loaded CD1d-CD19 fusion also strongly transactivate T-, B-, and NK-cell responses and promote dendritic cell maturation. Importantly, the alphaGC-loaded fusion induces robust lysis of CD19(+)CD1d(-) Epstein-Barr virus immortalized human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines that are otherwise resistant to iNKT cell killing. Consistent with these findings; administration of the alphaGC-loaded fusion protein controlled the growth of CD19(+)CD1d(-) tumors in vivo, suggesting that it can ""link"" iNKT cells and CD19(+)CD1d(-) targets in a therapeutically beneficial manner. Taken together, these preclinical studies demonstrate that this B cell-directed fusion protein can be used to effectively induce iNKT cell antitumor responses in vitro and in vivo.",Enhancing the antitumor functions of invariant natural killer T cells using a soluble CD1d-CD19 fusion protein.
"BACKGROUND: A purpose of duty-hour regulations is to reduce sleep deprivation in medical trainees, but their effects on sleep, sleepiness, and alertness are largely unknown. METHODS: We randomly assigned 63 internal-medicine residency programs in the United States to follow either standard 2011 duty-hour policies or flexible policies that maintained an 80-hour workweek without limits on shift length or mandatory time off between shifts. Sleep duration and morning sleepiness and alertness were compared between the two groups by means of a noninferiority design, with outcome measures including sleep duration measured with actigraphy, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (with scores ranging from 1 [extremely alert] to 9 [extremely sleepy, fighting sleep]), and a brief computerized Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT-B), with long response times (lapses) indicating reduced alertness. RESULTS: Data were obtained over a period of 14 days for 205 interns at six flexible programs and 193 interns at six standard programs. The average sleep time per 24 hours was 6.85 hours (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.61 to 7.10) among those in flexible programs and 7.03 hours (95% CI, 6.78 to 7.27) among those in standard programs. Sleep duration in flexible programs was noninferior to that in standard programs (between-group difference, -0.17 hours per 24 hours; one-sided lower limit of the 95% confidence interval, -0.45 hours; noninferiority margin, -0.5 hours; P = 0.02 for noninferiority), as was the score on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (between-group difference, 0.12 points; one-sided upper limit of the 95% confidence interval, 0.31 points; noninferiority margin, 1 point; P<0.001). Noninferiority was not established for alertness according to the PVT-B (between-group difference, -0.3 lapses; one-sided upper limit of the 95% confidence interval, 1.6 lapses; noninferiority margin, 1 lapse; P = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: This noninferiority trial showed no more chronic sleep loss or sleepiness across trial days among interns in flexible programs than among those in standard programs. Noninferiority of the flexible group for alertness was not established.

"BACKGROUND: A commonly used treatment for open wounds, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has recently been used to optimize wound healing in the setting of surgically closed wounds; however, the specific mechanisms of action by which NPWT may benefit patients after surgery remain unknown. Using a swine wound healing model, the current study investigates angiogenesis as a candidate mechanism. METHODS: Multiple excisional wounds were created on the dorsa of 10 male Yorkshire pigs and closed by primary suture. The closed wounds underwent treatment with either NPWT dressing or control dressings in the absence of negative pressure. Dressings were maintained for 8 days followed by euthanasia of the animal. Scar evaluation of the wounds by photographic analysis was performed, and wounds were analyzed for angiogenesis markers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Scar evaluation scores were observed to be significantly higher for the NPWT-treated sites compared with the control sites (P < 0.05). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results demonstrated increases for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) staining at the incision site treated with NPWT compared with other treatment groups (P < 0.05). In addition, an approximately 3-fold elevation in VEGF expression was observed at the NPWT-treated sites (2.8% vs. 1%, respectively; P < 0.0001).). However, there was no significant difference in immunohistochemistry staining. CONCLUSIONS: The use of NPWT improves the appearance of wounds and appears to increase VEGF expression after 8 days in the setting of a closed excisional wound model, suggesting that improved angiogenesis is one mechanism by which NPWT optimizes wound healing when applied to closed surgical wound sites.",Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Augments Perfusion and Improves Wound Healing in a Swine Model Pilot Study.
Investigation of the needs of same-sex mothers practicing lactation is limited in the nursing literature. The heteronormative structure of the healthcare system has stigmatized these postpartum women and minimized the level of nursing care provided. Case reports demonstrate that same-sex mothers value inclusivity and understanding of their healthcare needs that is missing in healthcare settings. Perinatal nurses must listen attentively and think critically about their words and actions to avoid inappropriate judgments when providing care to this population. Active engagement and ongoing competence education builds the foundation that will provide perinatal nurses the knowledge they need to best support the unique needs of same-sex mothers in their lactation experience.,Same-Sex Mothers and Lactation.
"At early disease stages, Lewy body disorders are characterized by limbic versus brainstem alpha-synucleinopathy, but most preclinical studies focus solely on the nigrostriatal pathway. Furthermore, gender and age are two major risk factors for this family of conditions, but their influence on the topographical extents of alpha-synucleinopathy and the degree of cell loss are uncertain. To fill these gaps, we infused alpha-synuclein fibrils in the olfactory bulb/anterior olfactory nucleus complex-one of the earliest and most frequently affected brain regions in Lewy body disorders-in 3 month-old female and male mice and in 11 month-old male mice. After 6 months, we observed that alpha-synucleinopathy did not expand much beyond the limbic connectome in the 9 month-old male and female mice or in the 17 month-old male mice. However, 9 month-old male mice had developed greater alpha-synucleinopathy, smell impairment, and cell loss than age-matched females, consistent perhaps with higher Lewy body disease risk in men. By 10.5 months post-infusion, fibril treatment hastened mortality in the 21.5 month-old males, and the inclusions remained centered in the limbic system in the survivors. Although fibril infusions reduced the number of cells expressing tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra of young males at 6 months post-infusion, this was not attributable to true cell death. Furthermore, mesencephalic alpha-synucleinopathy, if present, was centered in mesolimbic circuits (ventral tegmental area/ accumbens) rather than within strict boundaries of the nigral pars compacta, which were defined by tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabel. Nonprimate models cannot be expected to faithfully recapitulate human Lewy body disorders, but our murine model seems reasonably suited to 1) capture some aspects of Beach's Stage IIb of Lewy body disorders, which displays a heavier limbic than brainstem component compared to incipient Parkinson's disease, and 2) leverage sex differences and the acceleration of mortality following induction of olfactory alpha-synucleinopathy.

"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment with thiopurines is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We studied outcomes of patients with IBD who developed SCC while receiving thiopurine therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 54,919 patients with IBD followed in the nationwide Veterans Affairs Healthcare System from January 1, 2000 through May 23, 2018. From this cohort, we created a sub-cohort of patients with an incident diagnosis of SCC, confirmed by review of patients' medical records; we identified those who had received treatment with thiopurines (exposed group) vs those treated with 5-ASA and no prior exposure to thiopurines or tumor necrosis factor antagonists (unexposed group). The primary outcome was death associated with SCC (SCC mortality). We collected data on baseline demographic features, exposure to ultraviolet light, Charlson comorbidity index, smoking status, and environmental exposures. Follow up began at the time of incident SCC diagnosis and ended at death or last recorded date in the health system. Cause-specific hazard models were used to estimate the adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratio (HRs), with 95% CIs, for SCC mortality. RESULTS: We identified 467 patients with incident SCC and included 449 patients (161 exposed and 288 unexposed) in our final analysis. Eleven patients from complications of SCC (8 in the exposed group and 3 in the unexposed group). The estimated 5- and 10-year cumulative mortality values were 2.9% and 2.9% in the exposed group and 0.4% and 0.9% in the unexposed group, respectively. The unadjusted and adjusted cause-specific HRs for SCC mortality associated with exposure were 7.0 (95% CI, 1.8-28.0; P=.006) and 8.0 (95% CI, 2.0-32.8; P=.004), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the cause-specific mortality is relatively low, patients with IBD exposed to thiopurines who develop SCC have an increased risk of SCC-associated death compared to patients exposed to only 5-ASA.",Mortality Associated With Development of Squamous Cell Cancer in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease Receiving Treatment With Thiopurines.
"BACKGROUND: The STS CHSD Mortality Risk Model adjusts not only for procedure and age group pairings, but also for additional patient factors, including the binary presence or absence of a chromosomal abnormality (CA), syndrome (S), and/or noncardiac congenital anatomic abnormality (NCAA). This analysis refines case mix adjustment by adding more granular adjustment for individual conditions (CA, S, and NCAA), consistent with a hypothesis that associated mortality risk differs between individual conditions. METHODS: CA/S corresponding to the same condition were merged to a single condition code. For CA/S associated with at least 10 deaths in neonates and infants and at least 10 deaths in children and adults, odds ratios were estimated for the effect of the CA/S separately in neonates/infants and in children/adults. In addition to these condition/age interactions, condition/age/procedure interactions were explored (e.g. effect of Down syndrome was estimated based on age and procedure subgroups, including AV canal repair and single ventricle palliation). Five maximally homogeneous groups of CA/S were created from 81 candidate CA/S variables using Bayesian modelling. A standard logistic regression model then incorporated indicator variables for the 5 categories of CA/S, 7 unique NCAA, and all other covariates in the previously published STS CHSD Mortality Model. RESULTS: Analysis included 107,062 operations (100 centers, 2010-2015). Operative Mortality=3629 (3.4%). In the development sample, the c-statistics of the original non-augmented model and augmented model were 0.872 and 0.875, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The STS CHSD Mortality Risk Model has been augmented by addition of covariates representing individual CA, S, and NCAA.",Refining the STS CHSD Mortality Risk Model with Enhanced Risk Adjustment.

"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a rare pediatric overgrowth disorder that includes a spectrum of clinical findings including macroglossia, especially in those with loss of methylation at the imprinting control region (IC2 LOM) on chromosome 11. Children with BWS can have very severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but the prevalence of OSA in this population is poorly understood, as is the relationship between OSA and the BWS genotype/phenotype. We hypothesized that there would be a high prevalence of OSA in children with BWS, and that OSA would be more severe in children with IC2 LOM. METHODS: Medical records from children evaluated from March 2015 through January 2018 were reviewed for results from polysomnography, genetic testing, and clinical assessment. RESULTS: A total of 26 children with BWS not previously treated for OSA underwent polysomnography, genetic testing, and clinical assessment. Median (range) age was 5 months (3 days to 33 months). Most children, 20 (76.9%), had an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) > 2 events/h. Median (range) OAHI was 4.4 events/h (0 to 56.1 events/h). OAHI was significantly greater in participants younger than 6 months compared with those older than 6 months (P = .008). Those with IC2 LOM did not have a greater OAHI (P = .61) than those with other genetic causes of BWS, but OAHI had a strong positive correlation with BWS clinical score (Spearman rho = .54, P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of OSA in children with BWS with macroglossia. Younger children with BWS and those with more phenotypic features may be at greatest risk of OSA.",Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Children With Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome.

"BACKGROUND: Molidustat, a novel hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, is being investigated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The efficacy and safety of molidustat were recently evaluated in three 16-week phase 2b studies. Here, we report the results of two long-term extension studies of molidustat. METHODS: Both studies were parallel-group, open-label, multicenter studies of </=36 months' duration, in patients with anemia due to CKD, and included an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent as active control. One study enrolled patients not receiving dialysis (n = 164), and the other enrolled patients receiving hemodialysis (n = 88). The primary efficacy variable for both studies was change in blood hemoglobin (Hb) level from baseline to each post-baseline visit, and safety outcomes included adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: In patients not on dialysis, the mean +/- SD Hb concentrations at baseline were 11.28 +/- 0.55 g/dL for molidustat and 11.08 +/- 0.51 g/dL for darbepoetin. The mean +/- SD blood Hb concentrations throughout the study (defined as mean of each patient's overall study Hb levels) were 11.10 +/- 0.508 and 10.98 +/- 0.571 g/dL in patients treated with molidustat and darbepoetin, respectively. Similar proportions of patients reported at least one AE in the molidustat (85.6%) and darbepoetin (85.7%) groups. In patients on dialysis, mean +/- SD Hb levels at baseline were 10.40 +/- 0.70 and 10.52 +/- 0.53 g/dL in the molidustat and epoetin groups, respectively. The mean +/- SD blood Hb concentrations during the study were 10.37 +/- 0.56 g/dL in the molidustat group and 10.52 +/- 0.47 g/dL in the epoetin group. Proportions of patients who reported at least one AE were 91.2% in the molidustat group and 93.3% in the epoetin group. CONCLUSIONS: Molidustat was well tolerated for up to 36 months and appears to be an effective alternative to darbepoetin and epoetin in the long-term management of anemia associated with CKD.",Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Molidustat for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease: DIALOGUE Extension Studies.
"When transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was first approved for use in the United States in 2012, multiple leading surgical and cardiology societies were tasked with creating recommendations and requirements for operators and institutions starting and maintaining TAVR programs. Creation of this consensus document was challenging due to limited experience with this new technology, and a lack of robust centralized data that could be used to validate outcome measures and create benchmarks for self-assessment and improvement. Despite these limitations, this document provided government agencies a framework for regulation that ultimately determined requirements for Medicare payment for TAVR and therefore greatly determined how and where care was delivered for patients with aortic stenosis. After the proliferation of TAVR institutions throughout the US and with data from more than 100,000 cases in the STS/ACC Transcatheter Valve Therapies TM Registry, leaders of the same societies reconvened in 2018 to update their consensus document. The new recommendations include suggested personnel, facilities, training, and assessment of outcomes and competencies required to run a safe and efficient TAVR program.

"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that elective primary colon resection (ePCR) in patients with asymptomatic colon tumors and unresectable metastases is not required and may expose patients to unnecessary operative risk. METHODS: Stage IV colon cancer patients with liver metastases from 2000 to 2011 were identified with SEER-Medicare data. Liver-based therapy or urgent/emergent colectomies were excluded. Chemotherapy alone was compared to ePCR+/-chemotherapy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of ePCR. Multivariate Cox regression compared survival. RESULTS: 5139 patients were identified. The ePCR rate decreased over time; 84% underwent ePCR in 2000, compared to 52% in 2011 (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, older patients were more likely to undergo ePCR, as were patients from rural areas (OR 1.65, p<0.001). The odds of PCR in high poverty areas (>10%) were almost 25% higher than those in low poverty areas (OR 1.23, p=0.03). African-Americana were less likely to undergo PCR than Caucasians (OR 0.76, p=0.01). In multivariate survival analysis, PCR was associated with a significant survival benefit (HR 0.59, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although ePCR is not recommended with unresectable metastases and the rate has decreased significantly, over 50% of patients with untreated hepatic metastases underwent ePCR in 2011. Disparities exist in use of ePCR that are likely multifactorial and deserve further study.",Elective colon resection without curative intent in stage IV colon cancer.

"OBJECTIVE: To measure postmortem burden of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-Tau) proteinopathy across hemispheres in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) using digital histopathology, and identify clinicopathological correlates of these distinct proteinopathies. METHODS: In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD-TDP=13, FTLD-Tau=14), we analyzed laterality and regional distribution of postmortem pathology, quantified using a validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up to eight cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to antemortem structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features. RESULTS: Postmortem cortical pathology was left-lateralized in both FTLD-TDP (beta=-0.15,SE=0.05,p=0.007) and FTLD-Tau (beta=-0.09,SE=0.04,p=0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta=-8.18,SE=3.22,p=0.015). Among five core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD-TDP, which was greater than in FTLD-Tau (F=47.07,df=1,17,p<0.001), and in left mid-frontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD-Tau, which was greater than in FTLD-TDP (F=19.34,df=1,16,p<0.001). Postmortem pathology was inversely associated with antemortem MRI cortical thickness (beta=-0.04,SE=0.01,p=0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single-word comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (t=-3.72,df=10.72,p=0.004), while nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (t=-3.62,df=12.00,p=0.004) among the five core pathology regions. INTERPRETATION: In PPA, FTLD-TDP and FTLD-Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of left-lateralized postmortem pathology that relate to antemortem structural imaging and distinct language deficits. While other brain regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, our observations may eventually help to improve antemortem diagnosis of neuropathology in PPA.

"PURPOSE: The criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were revised in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of DSM-IV-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and DSM-5 definitions of ASD in a community-based sample of preschool children. METHODS: Children between 2 and 5 years of age were enrolled in the Study to Explore Early Development-Phase 2 (SEED2) and received a comprehensive developmental evaluation. The clinician(s) who evaluated the child completed two diagnostic checklists that indicated the presence and severity of DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 criteria. Definitions for DSM-5 ASD, DSM-IV-TR autistic disorder, and DSM-IV-TR Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) were created from the diagnostic checklists. RESULTS: 773 children met SEED2 criteria for ASD and 288 met criteria for another developmental disorder (DD). Agreement between DSM-5 and DSM-IV-TR definitions of ASD were good for autistic disorder (0.78) and moderate for PDD-NOS (0.57 and 0.59). Children who met DSM-IV-TR autistic disorder but not DSM-5 ASD (n = 71) were more likely to have mild ASD symptoms, or symptoms accounted for by another disorder. Children who met PDD-NOS but not DSM-5 ASD (n = 66), or vice versa (n = 120) were less likely to have intellectual disability and more likely to be female. Sensitivity and specificity were best balanced with DSM-5 ASD criteria (0.95 and 0.78, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The DSM-5 definition of ASD maximizes diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the SEED2 sample. These findings support the DSM-5 conceptualization of ASD in preschool children.",DSM-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder maximizes diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in preschool children.
"BACKGROUND: Cytosine methylation of regulatory regions, such as promoters and enhancers, plays a key role in regulating gene expression, however, its role in kidney development has not been analyzed. METHODS: To identify functionally important epigenome-modifying enzymes and genome regions where methylation modifications are functionally important for kidney development, we performed genome-wide methylation analysis, expression profiling, and systematic genetic targeting of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b) and Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine hydroxylases (Tet2) in nephron progenitor cells (Six2 (Cre)) in mice. RESULTS: Genome-wide methylome analysis indicated dynamic changes on promoters and enhancers during development. Six2 (Cre) Dnmt3a (f/f), Six2 (Cre) Dnmt3b (f/f), and Six2 (Cre) Tet2 (f/f) mice showed no significant structural or functional renal abnormalities. In contrast, Six2 (Cre) Dnmt1 (f/f) mice died within 24 hours of birth, from a severe kidney developmental defect. Genome-wide methylation analysis indicated a marked loss of methylation of transposable elements. RNA sequencing detected endogenous retroviral transcripts. Expression of intracellular viral sensing pathways (RIG-I), early embryonic, nonrenal lineage genes and increased cell death contributed to the phenotype development. In podocytes, loss of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, or Tet2 did not lead to functional or structural differences at baseline or after toxic injury. CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide cytosine methylation and gene expression profiling showed that by silencing embryonic, nonrenal lineage genes and transposable elements, DNMT1-mediated cytosine methylation is essential for kidney development.",DNMT1 in Six2 Progenitor Cells Is Essential for Transposable Element Silencing and Kidney Development.
"Trending social media phenomena, often referred to as social media ""challenges,"" include those centered around pencil erasers, salt and ice, spray deodorant, and fire. Each of these share features of intentional self-injury with the possibility of permanent skin changes, although generally without the intent to cause harm.. The background history of these social media-associated activities is fascinating and perplexing. For the clinician, adept recognition of the characteristic skin signs of these behaviors affords the opportunity to discuss them in the open and to educate patients and their parents about how to avoid potential for more serious harm.",Current Trends in Social Media-Associated Skin Harm Among Children and Adolescents.
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have demonstrated continuous increased risk for maternal mortality and severe morbidity with racial disparities among non-Hispanic black women an important contributing factor. More than 50,000 women experienced severe maternal morbidity in 2014 with a mortality rate of 18.0 per 100,000, higher than many other developed countries. In 2012 the first ""Putting the 'M' back in Maternal Fetal Medicine"" session was held at the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine's (SMFM) Annual Meeting. With the realization that rising risk for severe maternal morbidity and mortality required action, the ""M in MFM"" meeting identified urgent needs to: (i) enhance education and training in maternal care for maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) fellows; (ii) improve the medical care and management of pregnant women across the country; and (iii) address critical research gaps in maternal medicine. Since that first meeting a broad collaborative effort has made a number of major steps forward including the proliferation of maternal mortality review committees, advances in research, increasing educational focus on maternal critical care, and development of comprehensive clinical strategies to reduce maternal risk. Five years later, the 2017 ""M in MFM"" meeting served as a ""report card"" looking back at progress made but also looking forward to what needs to be done over the next five years given that too many mothers still experience preventable harm and adverse outcomes.",Putting the 'M' back in maternal-fetal medicine: A five-year report card on a collaborative effort to address maternal morbidity and mortality in the U.S.
"PURPOSE: To examine the association of donor, recipient, and operative factors on graft dislocation after Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) in the Cornea Preservation Time Study (CPTS) as well as the effects of graft dislocation and elevated IOP on graft success and endothelial cell density (ECD) 3 years postoperatively. DESIGN: Cohort study within a multi-center, double-masked, randomized clinical trial. METHODS: 1,090 individuals (1,330 study eyes), median age 70 years, undergoing DSAEK for Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (94% of eyes) or pseudophakic or aphakic corneal edema (6% of eyes). Recipient eyes receiving donor corneal tissue randomized by preservation time (PT) of 0-7 days (N=675) or 8-14 days (N=655) were monitored for early or late graft failure through 3 years. Donor, recipient, operative, and postoperative parameters were recorded including graft dislocation (GD), partial detachment, and pre- and post-operative IOP. Pre- and postoperative central donor ECD were determined by a central image analysis reading center. Proportional hazards, mixed effects, and logistic regression models estimated risk ratios and {99% confidence intervals}. RESULTS: Three independent predictive factors for GD were identified: a history of donor diabetes (odds ratio {OR}: 2.29 {1.30, 4.02}), increased pre-lamellar dissection central corneal thickness (OR: 1.13 {1.01, 1.27} per 25mu increase), and operative complications (OR: 2.97 {1.24, 7.11}). Among 104 (8%) eyes with GD, 30 (28.9%) developed primary donor or early failure and 5 (4.8%) developed late failure vs. 15 (1.2%; p<0.001) and 29 (2.4%; p=0.04), respectively, of 1226 eyes without GD. 24 (2%) of 1330 study eyes had early acutely elevated postoperative IOP that was associated with a higher risk of graft failure through 3 years (hazard ratio: 3.42 {1.01, 11.53}), but not with a lower mean 3-year ECD (mean difference 61 {-479, 601} cells/mm(2), P=0.77). History of elevated postoperative IOP beyond 1 month was not significantly associated with 3-year graft success or ECD. CONCLUSIONS: Donor diabetes, increased donor corneal thickness, and intraoperative complications were associated with an increased risk of GD. Early acutely elevated postoperative IOP and GD significantly increased the risk for graft failure following DSAEK.",Effect of Graft Attachment Status and Intraocular Pressure on DSAEK Outcomes in the Cornea Preservation Time Study.
"A potentiating effect of medium-chain triglycerides on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) has been observed since the 1960s. Subsequent observations identified octanoic acid (OA), the main component of medium-chain triglyceride, as the potentiator of GSIS, but the mechanism was unclear. We used wild-type (WT), short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase knockout (Hadh(-/-)), and sulfonylurea receptor 1 knockout (Sur1(-/-)) mouse islets to define the mechanism of OA potentiation of insulin secretion. Application of OA alone induced a 2- to 3- fold increase of insulin secretion with an apparent threshold of 3 mM in WT mouse islets, suggesting that OA itself is a weak insulin secretagogue. However, OA at 1 mM strongly potentiated fuel-stimulated insulin secretion, especially GSIS. The potentiating effect on fuel-stimulated insulin secretion by OA did not require fatty acid beta-oxidation because OA also potentiated amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion in islets isolated from Hadh(-/-) mice, which cannot fully oxidize OA. Measurements using Sur1(-/-) islets indicated that the potentiating effect of OA on fuel-stimulated insulin secretion is Ca(2+) dependent and is often accompanied by beta-cell membrane potential depolarization, and may also involve the Ca(2+)/calmodulin complex. Experiments using DCPIB, an ethacrynic acid derivative, to inhibit volume-sensitive anion channels (VSACs) in Sur1(-/-) islets demonstrated that the potentiation effects of OA on insulin secretion are in part medicated by activation of VSAC. In addition, inhibition of IP3 receptor also abolishes the OA-induced intracellular Ca(2+) increase in Sur1(-/-) islets.",Mechanisms of octanoic acid potentiation of insulin secretion in isolated islets.
"Literature has indicated the mixed impact of television content on the executive function (EF) of preschoolers. This study investigated the short-term impact of TV fantastical events on children's EF performance and whether these impacts were different between boys and girls. This study included 143 preschoolers (Mage = 5.88 years, SDage = 0.32 years) and their parents. Participating children were randomly assigned to three groups to watch cartoons of high-fantasy, mid-fantasy, and low-fantasy, and then requested to perform on a series of EF tasks. The results revealed the nonlinear pattern for the effects of fantasy on inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. Specifically, children in the mid-fantasy group did worst on inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility and no significant group differences were found in working memory. However, no conclusive evidence existed to prove the moderating role of gender on the relationship between fantastical events and EF. Finally, the implications of the findings and future directions are discussed.",The effects of fantastical television content on Chinese preschoolers' executive function.
"Tisagenlecleucel is a chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy that facilitates the killing of CD19(+) B cells. A model was developed for the kinetics of tisagenlecleucel and the impact of therapies for treating cytokine release syndrome (tocilizumab and corticosteroids) on expansion. Data from two phase II studies in pediatric and young adult relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were pooled to evaluate this model and evaluate extrinsic and intrinsic factors that may impact the extent of tisagenlecleucel expansion. The doubling time, initial decline half-life, and terminal half-life for tisagenlecleucel were 0.78, 4.3, and 220 days, respectively. No impact of tocilizumab or corticosteroids on the expansion rate was observed. This work represents the first mixed-effect model-based analysis of chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy and may be clinically impactful as future studies examine prophylactic interventions in patients at risk of higher grade cytokine release syndrome and the effects of these interventions on chimeric antigen receptor-T cell expansion.",Tisagenlecleucel Model-Based Cellular Kinetic Analysis of Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T Cells.
"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Anthracyclines are used in induction therapy of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are known to generate oxidative stress; whether this translates into enhanced antileukemic activity or hemolytic effects in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is unknown. DESIGN/METHODS: Among 726 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ALL treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 22 had deficient G6PD activity. We compared the prevalence of positive minimal residual disease (MRD) >/=1% at Day 15/Day 19 of induction or >/=0.01% at Day 42/Day 46 (end of induction) and the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions after daunorubicin in induction between patients with or without G6PD deficiency, adjusting for ALL risk group, treatment protocol, age, and gender. RESULTS: There was no difference in Day 15/19 (P = 1) or end of induction MRD (P = 0.76) nor in the number of RBC transfusions (P = 0.73); the lack of association with MRD was confirmed in a dataset of 1192 newly diagnosed male patients enrolled in a Children's Oncology Group trial (P = 0.78). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that G6PD deficiency affects daunorubicin activity during induction treatment for ALL.",No evidence that G6PD deficiency affects the efficacy or safety of daunorubicin in acute lymphoblastic leukemia induction therapy.
"Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease associated with increased cardiovascular risk and serves as a reliable model to study inflammatory atherogenesis. Because neutrophils are implicated in atherosclerosis development, this study reports that the interaction among low-density granulocytes, a subset of neutrophils, and platelets is associated with a noncalcified coronary plaque burden assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography. Because early atherosclerotic noncalcified burden can lead to fatal myocardial infarction, the low-density granulocyte-platelet interaction may play a crucial target for clinical intervention.","Neutrophil Subsets, Platelets, and Vascular Disease in Psoriasis."
"Objective: Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a major source of Type-I Interferon (IFN-I), a key driver in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). Currently evaluated in Phase II clinical trial, 24F4A (BIIB059) is an antibody targeting BDCA2, an inhibitory receptor expressed on pDCs. Given that Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a widely-used CLE therapy, and 24F4A are both able to inhibit pDC-derived IFN-I production; this study aimed to determine whether 24F4A would show an additional inhibitory effect on pDC response after ex vivo or in vivo treatment with HCQ. Methods: The effect of 24F4A on pDC-derived IFNalpha was measured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) either from healthy donors in presence or absence of HCQ or from CLE patients clinically exposed to various levels of HCQ. TLR7, TLR7/8, and TLR9 agonists (ssRNA, R848, and CpG-A) were used for pDC stimulation. Results: PDCs were the only producers of IFNalpha in response to CpG-A, R848, and ssRNA stimulation in PBMC cultures. CLE patients with higher levels of blood HCQ showed lower ex vivo pDC responses to CpG-A, but not R848 or ssRNA. In contrast, 24F4A reduced the amount of IFNalpha produced by pDCs from CLE patients in response to all TLR agonists, irrespective of the blood HCQ level. Conclusion: Our findings reveal that clinically-relevant HCQ concentrations partially inhibit the pDC response to TLR9 and weakly affect the response to TLR7/8 stimulation. 24F4A robustly inhibits pDC responses even in the presence of HCQ, highlighting its unique potential to disrupt pDC disease relevant biology, which could provide additional therapeutic benefit for CLE patients.",Effect of in vivo Hydroxychloroquine and ex vivo Anti-BDCA2 mAb Treatment on pDC IFNalpha Production From Patients Affected With Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus.

The compounds were synthesized from the 4-(3-(4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)ureido)benzensulfonamide (1) by using stepwise nucleophilic substitution of the chlorine atoms of cyanuric chloride. The intermediates 2(a-e) and final compounds 3(a-o) were tested for their efficiency as carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors against four selected physiologically relevant human carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) isoforms, namely, the cytosolic ones hCA I and II, and the transmembrane, tumor associated ones hCA IX, and XII. The compounds 2a, 2e and 3m showed the highest activity for hCA IX with Kis in the range of 11.8-14.6nM. Most of the compounds showed high hCA IX selectivity over the abundant off-target isoforms hCA I and II. Since hCA IX is a validated drug target for anticancer/antimetastatic agents, these isoform-selective and potent inhibitors may be considered of interest for further medicinal/pharmacologic studies.","Discovery of new ureido benzenesulfonamides incorporating 1,3,5-triazine moieties as carbonic anhydrase I, II, IX and XII inhibitors."

"BACKGROUND: Understanding reasons for and impact of women's toileting behaviors on bladder health is important to prevent and manage urinary incontinence (UI) and overactive bladder (OAB). METHODS: Women, regardless of urinary incontinence (UI) and overactive bladder (OAB) status, were recruited in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Focus groups were conducted by trained female moderators and sessions were audiotaped. Participants completed an anonymous questionnaire containing validated items to determine the presence of UI and OAB. Audiotapes were transcribed and content was analyzed by two investigators to identify themes. RESULTS: Twenty-four women participated (mean age 68 +/- 13.4 years); most had UI (75%) or OAB (87.5%). Many women had difficulty in describing bladder health, and talked about bladder function, diseases or conditions, and control over the bladder. Four themes about toileting emerged: 1) cues/triggers/alerts women used to find and use toilets, 2) toilet cleanliness away from and at home, 3) toileting as a nuisance, and 4) situational awareness. Women described internal (e.g., sensation of heaviness) and external cues/triggers/alerts (e.g., walking by restrooms), and the trade-off between their concerns about public toilet cleanliness and the need to urinate. Some women expressed being irritated or annoyed about having to stop activities to urinate. Most women reported sitting on their home toilets, whereas, many hovered or stood over the toilet in public places. CONCLUSIONS: The information gained from this study will facilitate the development of relevant public health messaging and interventions to raise public awareness about UI, OAB, and bladder health with the aim to encourage women to seek help when symptoms are present.","""A secret club"": focus groups about women's toileting behaviors."
"BACKGROUND: Preoperative opioid use results in adverse outcomes and higher costs after elective surgery. However, duration thresholds for higher risk are not entirely known. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to determine the number and duration of preoperative opioid prescriptions in order to estimate the risk of postoperative adverse events after major joint replacement and lumbar fusion. METHODS: National insurance claims data (2007 to September 30, 2015) were used to identify primary total knee arthroplasties (TKAs), total hip arthroplasties (THAs), and 1 or 2-level posterior lumbar fusions (PLFs) performed for degenerative disease. The effect of preoperative opioid burden (naive, </=3 months, >3 to 6 months, >6 months but stopped 3 months before surgery, and >6 months of continuous use) on the risks of various adverse outcomes was studied using Cox proportional hazards analysis with adjustment for demographic and clinical covariates. RESULTS: A total of 58,082 patients stratified into 3 cohorts of 32,667 with TKA, 14,734 with THA, and 10,681 with 1 or 2-level PLF were included for this analysis. A duration of preoperative opioids of >3 months was associated with a higher risk of 90-day emergency department (ED) visits for all causes and readmission after TKA. Preoperative opioid prescription for >6 months was associated with a higher risk of all-cause and pain-related ED visits, wound dehiscence/infection, and hospital readmission within 90 days as well as revision surgery within 1 year after TKA, THA, and PLF. Stopping the opioid prescription 3 months preoperatively for chronic users resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of adverse outcomes, with the greatest impact seen after THA and PLF. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a preoperative opioid prescription for up to 3 months before a major arthroplasty or a 1 or 2-level lumbar fusion had a similar risk of adverse outcomes as opioid-naive patients. While >6 months of opioid use was associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes, a 3-month prescription-free period before the surgery appeared to mitigate this risk for chronic users.

"PURPOSE: Humanism in medicine is associated with increased patient satisfaction, trust of patients in their doctors, and better outcomes. The authors sought to identify attitudes, habits, and other factors that sustain humanism in academic surgical faculty, and compare these with attributes determined from a previous study of internal medicine faculty. METHOD: A mixed-methods study design at University of Pennsylvania Health System was employed from 2016 to 2018 using a survey instrument and semi-structured interviews. Surgical residents nominated faculty who exemplified humanism. In-depth interviews were then conducted with surgeons receiving the most nominations. The interviews were transcribed, and common themes were identified using grounded theory method. These were compared with findings from a previous internal medicine study. RESULTS: Ten faculty described three strongly shared attitudes: humility, responsibility, and a desire to live up to a high standard of professional behavior. Five habits were found important to sustaining these attitudes and their practice: self-reflection, finding deep connections with patients, maintaining personal and professional relationships, ""having fun"" at work, and paying it forward to surgical trainees. Surgeons also cited the importance of past role models in developing humanistic attitudes and sustaining practice. Responses were compared to previously documented attitudes and habits of humanistic internal medicine faculty at the institution. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified recurring attitudes and habits that characterize humanistic behaviors in a cohort of academic surgeons. Learning from these exemplary humanistic surgeons may inform the development of future educational programs for residents and faculty in sustaining humanism.","Attitudes and Habits of Highly Humanistic Surgeons: A Single-Institution, Mixed-Methods Study."

"The mTOR pathway is central to most cells. How mTOR is activated in macrophages and modulates macrophage physiology remain poorly understood. The tumor suppressor Folliculin (FLCN) is a GAP for RagC/D, a regulator of mTOR. We show here that LPS potently suppresses FLCN in macrophages, allowing nuclear translocation of the transcription factor TFE3, leading to lysosome biogenesis, cytokine production, and hypersensitivity to inflammatory signals. Nuclear TFE3 additionally activates a transcriptional RagD positive feedback loop that stimulates FLCN-independent canonical mTOR signaling to S6K and increases cellular proliferation. LPS thus simultaneously suppresses the TFE3 arm and activates the S6K arm of mTOR. In vivo, mice lacking myeloid FLCN reveal chronic macrophage activation, leading to profound histiocytic infiltration and tissue disruption, with hallmarks of human histiocytic syndromes like Erdheim-Chester Disease. Our data thus identify a critical FLCN-mTOR-TFE3 axis in myeloid cells, modulated by LPS, that balances mTOR activation and curbs innate immune responses.",Myeloid Folliculin balances mTOR activation to maintain innate immunity homeostasis.
"PURPOSE: Poor sleep and pain are common in veterans with serious mental illness (SMI), yet it is unclear how these may impact dimensions of quality of life. As such, this study examined independent and additive contributions of sleep and pain difficulties on quality of life (QoL) among a sample of veterans with SMI and insomnia. METHOD: Participants were 57 veterans with SMI (schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, or major depressive disorders with significant functional impairment) and at least subthreshold insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index >/=8). Measures assessed sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), pain intensity (Pain Numeric Rating Scale [PNRS]), pain interference (Short Form 12 Health Survey), and QoL (World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF). Multivariate multiple regression analyses examined the effects of sleep quality and pain on QoL. RESULTS: Forty-one veterans (71.9%) reported moderate-to-severe pain (PNRS >/=4). Poorer sleep quality was associated with greater pain interference and worse physical, emotional, and environmental QoL. Sleep quality, not pain, explained significant variance in environmental QoL (b = -2.30; 95% confidence interval [CI: -4.16, -.43]). Pain interference, not sleep quality, explained significant variance in physical health-related QoL (b = -.23; 95% CI [-.38, -.08]). CONCLUSIONS: Results reveal the importance of screening for insomnia and chronic pain among veterans with SMI. For these veterans who already struggle with daytime functioning, interventions such as integrated cognitive-behavioral therapy for pain-related insomnia are warranted. Such treatments must account for how sleep disturbance and chronic pain may differentially impact multiple facets of QoL.

"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the feasibility of quantifying fluorine-18-fluorodexoglucose ((18)F-FDG) and (18)F-sodium fluoride ((18)F-NaF) uptake in abdominal aorta and examine their association with age and cardiovascular risk factors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Our study comprised 123 subjects (48+/-14 years of age, 62 men) including 78 healthy volunteers and 45 patients with chest pain syndrome, who originally enrolled in the CAMONA study in Odense, Denmark (NCT01724749). All subjects underwent (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and (18)F-NaF PET/CT on separate days, 180min and 90min after administration of tracers, respectively. The global tracer uptake value (GTUV) in the abdominal aorta was determined as sum of the product of each slice area and its corresponding average standardized uptake value (SUV mean), divided by the sum of those slice areas. In addition, for each subject, the 10 years Framingham risk score (FRS) was calculated. The correlations between (18)F-NaF and (18)F-FDG GTUV with age and 10 years FRS were assessed in all, healthy and patient subjects. RESULTS: There was a significant, positive correlation between subjects' age and (18)F-NaF GTUV (r=0.35, P<0.001), but not (18)F-FDG GTUV (r=0.06, P=0.53). Also, there was a significant, positive correlation between 10 years FRS and (18)F-NaF GTUV (r=0.30, P<0.001), but not (18)F-FDG GTUV (r=0.01, P=0.95). Individual differences in (18)F-FDG and 1(18)F-NaF uptake were large in both healthy subjects and patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, the global uptake of (18)F-NaF in abdominal aorta was positively associated with age and 10 years FRS in all subjects, healthy and patient groups, whereas the global uptake of (18)F-FDG was not.","Association between age, uptake of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and of (18)F-sodium fluoride, as cardiovascular risk factors in the abdominal aorta."
"Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) imaging was conceived in the early 1970 by investigators at the University of Pennsylvania as a research technique to measure brain metabolism and function by employing a non-invasive imaging approach. Soon after the introduction of whole-body PET instruments, (18)F-FDG was utilized in the assessment of a variety of solid tumors and certain hematological malignancies. Yet, the role of (18)F-FDG in assessing benign and uncommon malignant disorders of the bone marrow has not been investigated to a great extent. Fluorine-18-FDG as a molecular probe has the proven capacity to reflect the abnormal glycolytic activities inherent to a variety of disorders, where such information may serve as a guide to the clinical course of the respective disease. Recent efforts have studied bone marrow and extra-medullary disease activity in certain malignancies like chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Nonetheless, few studies have explored the role of (18)F-FDG in assessing the metabolic basis of benign disorders of red marrow. Moreover, the introduction of novel imaging analysis schemes in recent years has allowed for the global assessment of red marrow disease, which can provide a superior means for characterizing the systemic nature and burden of these disorders. Accordingly, semi-quantitative global analysis techniques as applied to the skeletal structures in (18)F-FDG PET may provide a tool to better understand these complex marrow abnormalities. Functional imaging of red bone marrow may also reveal critical information specifically regarding the extra-medullary extension of such hematological disorders that cannot be assessed by other diagnostic or imaging techniques. Myleoproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are an apt category of hematological disease that confer significantly altered systemic metabolic rates of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the marrow, as such they are primed for exploration with (18)F-FDG PET. The hallmark of such disorders involves the excess production of particular cellular components in blood. After a period of excess production, scar tissue may develop in place of the HSC leading to myleofibrosis and decreased hematopoietic activity. One of the least studied disorders within the larger category of MPN with respect to the nuclear medicine is polycythemia. Polycythemia may be either primary, polycythemia vera (PV), or secondary. PV involves a JAK2+ in HSC which allows for the excessive proliferation of immature erythrocytes and depressed erythropoietin levels as a result. Secondary polycythemia occurs in response to decreased oxygen intake, often as a result of smoking, which results in increased erythropoietin and hematocrit levels. Primary and secondary polycythemia lead to an increase in overall red marrow activity and a diffusion of active red marrow into the appendicular skeleton. Clinical presentation often includes redness or irritation of the skin along with headache, fatigue and excessive bleeding. Based upon the mentioned precedent, it is evident that PET imaging with (18)F-FDG and other tracers will play a meaningful role in assessing diffuse bone marrow disorders such as hematological malignancies and myeloproliferative abnormalities. Semi-quantification studies of global bone marrow activity in such an application will be a vital means in accurately assessing the systematic nature and global burden of such benign hematological disorders such a polycythemia. Accordingly, the derived metabolic data projects to be a useful tool in the prospective clinical and scientific aspects of the diagnosis of these benign hematological disorders and the assessment of disease progression in light of relevant biological treatments. Given the nature of the disease and the enumerated capabilities of (18)F-FDG PET it is expected that one would be able to capture the systematic abnormalities inherent to the disease. Moreover, the handful of case studies supports this possibility. Three case studies have all illustrated diffuse elevated (18)F-FDG uptake throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton that reflects the hyper-metabolic red bone marrow as related to polycythemia. Moreover, the use of various functional imaging tracers, in addition to (18)F-FDG, may indirectly reflect hypermetabolism in red bone marrow through abnormal tracer accumulation in the skeletons of patients. The whole body (18)F-FDG scan of a JAK2+ PV patient before treatment (a) as compared to a matched subject (b) is found below; of note is the PV patient's elevated uptake in the pelvis, femur and spine.",The role of (18)F-FDG PET in the assessment of a benign hematological disorder: polycythemia.
"Quantitative changes in leptin concentration lead to alterations in food intake and body weight, but the regulatory mechanisms that control leptin gene expression are poorly understood. Here we report that fat-specific and quantitative leptin expression is controlled by redundant cis elements and trans factors interacting with the proximal promoter together with a long noncoding RNA (lncOb). Diet-induced obese mice lacking lncOb show increased fat mass with reduced plasma leptin levels and lose weight after leptin treatment, whereas control mice do not. Consistent with this finding, large-scale genetic studies of humans reveal a significant association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region of human lncOb with lower plasma leptin levels and obesity. These results show that reduced leptin gene expression can lead to a hypoleptinemic, leptin-responsive form of obesity and provide a framework for elucidating the pathogenic mechanism in the subset of obese patients with low endogenous leptin levels.",Dysregulation of a long noncoding RNA reduces leptin leading to a leptin-responsive form of obesity.
"The liver is the most common site of metastatic disease(1). Although this metastatic tropism may reflect the mechanical trapping of circulating tumour cells, liver metastasis is also dependent, at least in part, on the formation of a 'pro-metastatic' niche that supports the spread of tumour cells to the liver(2,3). The mechanisms that direct the formation of this niche are poorly understood. Here we show that hepatocytes coordinate myeloid cell accumulation and fibrosis within the liver and, in doing so, increase the susceptibility of the liver to metastatic seeding and outgrowth. During early pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice, hepatocytes show activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling and increased production of serum amyloid A1 and A2 (referred to collectively as SAA). Overexpression of SAA by hepatocytes also occurs in patients with pancreatic and colorectal cancers that have metastasized to the liver, and many patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease show increases in circulating SAA. Activation of STAT3 in hepatocytes and the subsequent production of SAA depend on the release of interleukin 6 (IL-6) into the circulation by non-malignant cells. Genetic ablation or blockade of components of IL-6-STAT3-SAA signalling prevents the establishment of a pro-metastatic niche and inhibits liver metastasis. Our data identify an intercellular network underpinned by hepatocytes that forms the basis of a pro-metastatic niche in the liver, and identify new therapeutic targets.",Hepatocytes direct the formation of a pro-metastatic niche in the liver.

"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether restrictiveness-permissiveness of state gun laws or gun ownership are associated with mass shootings in the US. DESIGN: Cross sectional time series. SETTING AND POPULATION: US gun owners from 1998-2015. EXPOSURE: An annual rating between 0 (completely restrictive) and 100 (completely permissive) for the gun laws of all 50 states taken from a reference guide for gun owners traveling between states from 1998 to 2015. Gun ownership was estimated annually as the percentage of suicides committed with firearms in each state. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mass shootings were defined as independent events in which four or more people were killed by a firearm. Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting System from 1998-2015 were used to calculate annual rates of mass shootings in each state. Mass shooting events and rates were further separated into those where the victims were immediate family members or partners (domestic) and those where the victims had other relationships with the perpetrator (non-domestic). RESULTS: Fully adjusted regression analyses showed that a 10 unit increase in state gun law permissiveness was associated with a significant 11.5% (95% confidence interval 4.2% to 19.3%, P=0.002) higher rate of mass shootings. A 10% increase in state gun ownership was associated with a significant 35.1% (12.7% to 62.7%, P=0.001) higher rate of mass shootings. Partially adjusted regression analyses produced similar results, as did analyses restricted to domestic and non-domestic mass shootings. CONCLUSIONS: States with more permissive gun laws and greater gun ownership had higher rates of mass shootings, and a growing divide appears to be emerging between restrictive and permissive states.","State gun laws, gun ownership, and mass shootings in the US: cross sectional time series."
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disease caused by dysregulated immune responses to commensal or pathogenic intestinal microbes, resulting in chronic intestinal inflammation. However, a subset of patients with IBD diagnosed <6 years of age, known as very early-onset (VEO)-IBD, can be phenotypically and genetically distinct from older onset IBD. We aim to review the clinical presentation of children with VEO-IBD and recent discoveries that point to the underlying genomic and immunologic drivers of disease, and the significant impact on our therapeutic decisions. RECENT FINDINGS: VEO-IBD is increasing in incidence and is associated with more severe disease, aggressive progression, and poor response to most conventional therapies. This article will review some of the genetic findings in this population and the subsequent impact on therapy, with targeted approaches. SUMMARY: Children with VEO-IBD may present with a different phenotype and more severe disease than older children and adults. An integrated approach combining genetics, immunology, and traditional IBD evaluations can lead to the identification of causal defects that directly impact management. These strategies can also be employed in older onset refractory IBD.",Genomic and Immunologic Drivers of Very Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
"INTRODUCTION:: Childbearing women with primary or secondary Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 infection are at risk of transmitting neonatal herpes infection to their infants; a medical emergency that is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Neonatal herpes infection has been commonly associated with Herpes Simplex Virus type 2, or genital herpes, but can be caused by either subtype and the presentations are indistinguishable. This case describes the course of diagnosis, treatment, and recovery for a mother and infant during a severe maternal and neonatal herpes infection, and how lactation was maintained and breastfeeding re-established. Our children's hospital coordinated its efforts to assist and monitor this breastfeeding family, and they were able to resume breastfeeding soon after discharge. It is our opinion that it is imperative that mothers receive evidence-based lactation care to maintain their breastfeeding relationship during extended hospital stays. MAIN ISSUE:: An acutely ill infant was admitted to our urban children's hospital with severe neonatal herpes infection for a total of three weeks. His mother was severely affected on her breasts and she required a brief hospitalization. The mother's breasts were covered with draining herpetic lesions that required daily dressing changes. However, her lesions were slow to heal, and a wound care consultation was facilitated and her treatment plan was adjusted. We were surprised that she experienced minimal discomfort with pumping and dressing changes. The mother maintained a positive outlook, complied with the plan to express frequently to maintain milk production, and was able to breastfeed again when they both recovered. MANAGEMENT:: This mother received immediate support and appropriate pumping equipment from our hospital personnel and was subsequently able to establish and maintain her milk supply. The difficulty in this case was the management of the mother's extensive herpetic wounds that were slow to heal. A certified wound care specialist was required. Both mother and child recovered from their infections and were able to restart breastfeeding; eventually reaching their goal of breastfeeding for two years. CONCLUSIONS:: Neonatal herpes infection is a potentially fatal disease and maternal child health professionals should have a high suspicion for any ill-appearing newborn with or without a rash. When a breastfeeding infant and mother become infected with Herpes Simplex Virus type 1, it is the responsibility of the healthcare institution to support lactation and the return to breastfeeding rather than recommend cessation of lactation, which is rarely necessary. A multi-disciplinary evidence-based approach to lactation care is essential to preserve lactation during infant hospitalization.",Maintaining Breastfeeding During Severe Infant and Maternal HSV-1 Infection: A Case Report.
"Disease surveillance in wildlife is rapidly expanding in scope and methodology, emphasizing the need for formal evaluations of system performance. We examined a syndromic surveillance system for respiratory disease detection in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, from 2004 to 2012, with respect to data quality, disease trends, and respiratory disease detection. Data quality was assessed by examining community coverage, completeness, and consistency. The data were examined for baseline trends; signs of respiratory disease occurred at a mean frequency of less than 1 case per week, with most weeks containing zero observations of abnormalities. Seasonal and secular (i.e., over a period of years) trends in respiratory disease frequency were not identified. These baselines were used to develop algorithms for outbreak detection using both weekly counts and weekly prevalence thresholds and then compared retrospectively on the detection of 13 respiratory disease clusters from 2005 to 2012. Prospective application of outbreak detection algorithms to real-time syndromic data would be useful in triggering a rapid outbreak response, such as targeted diagnostic sampling, enhanced surveillance, or mitigation.",Syndromic Surveillance of Respiratory Disease in Free-Living Chimpanzees.
"Objectives: To identify the prevalence of dystonia in a RNA Polymerase III (POLR3)-related leukodystrophy patient cohort and to further characterize their dystonic features. Background: POLR3-related leukodystrophy is a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy characterized by neurological and non-neurological features. Dystonia remains a challenging and under-recognized feature. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed in a cohort of 20 patients for whom videos of a standardized neurological examination were available. Patients were recruited at the Montreal Children's Hospital of the McGill University Health Center and the Myelin Disorders Bioregistry Project. Families were consented at the initial assessment and the following data was recorded: age and symptoms at clinical presentation, investigations, causal gene and mutation(s), type and severity of dystonia, and treatment response when needed. Standardized examination videos were reviewed by three independent reviewers and scored using the Global Dystonia Scale. Results: 10 males and 10 females were included in this study; 12/20 had POLR3A mutations, while 8/20 had POLR3B mutations; 19/20 patients had documented dystonia, with 3/19 requiring therapy. There was a good response in two patients to a single agent, and a poor response in one patient to three agents; the majority had mild-to-moderate multifocal dystonia without a functional impact. Conclusions: Dystonia is a common, yet underdiagnosed, slowly progressive manifestation of POLR3-related leukodystrophy, and in most cases has limited-to-no functional impact. When treatment is needed, good response to typically used medication may occur. Further studies are needed to assess evolution of dystonia over time, patients' functional outcome, and response to therapy (when needed).",Dystonia in RNA Polymerase III-Related Leukodystrophy.
"Mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene remain a hallmark of human cancer. In addition to mutation of TP53, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene can have a profound impact on p53 function, and can affect cancer risk as well as other p53 functions. Wild type (WT) p53 contains a proline at amino acid 47, but approximately 1% of African-Americans express a p53 allele with a serine at amino acid 47 (Pro47Ser, hereafter S47). In a mouse model for this variant, mice expressing S47 are predisposed to spontaneous cancers. The S47 variant also is associated with increased pre-menopausal breast cancer risk in African American women. We recently reported that S47 tumor cells are resistant to the majority of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, but show increased sensitivity to a subset of anti-cancer agents, compared to tumors with WT p53. In this work, we report on another potentially promising therapeutic vulnerability of S47 tumors. We find that S47 tumors show decreased mitochondrial metabolism, along with increased dependency on glycolysis. S47 tumor cells also show increased sensitivity to the glycolytic poison 2-deoxy-glucose. We propose that the altered metabolism in S47 tumor cells may be yet another potentially-actionable therapeutic vulnerability to exploit in cancer-prone individuals with this genotype.",Tumor cells containing the African-Centric S47 variant of TP53 show increased Warburg metabolism.
"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are key players in immune evasion, tumor progression and metastasis. MDSCs accumulate under various pathological states and fall into two functionally and phenotypically distinct subsets that have been identified in humans and mice: polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs and monocytic (M)-MDSCs. As dogs are an excellent model for human tumor development and progression, we set out to identify PMN-MDSCs and M-MDSCs in clinical canine oncology patients. Canine hypodense MHC class II(-)CD5(-)CD21(-)CD11b(+) cells can be subdivided into polymorphonuclear (CADO48A(+)CD14(-)) and monocytic (CADO48A(-)CD14(+)) MDSC subsets. The transcriptomic signatures of PMN-MDSCs and M-MDSCs are distinct, and moreover reveal a statistically significant similarity between canine and previously published human PMN-MDSC gene expression patterns. As in humans, peripheral blood frequencies of canine PMN-MDSCs and M-MDSCs are significantly higher in dogs with cancer compared to healthy control dogs (PMN-MDSCs: p < 0.001; M-MDSCs: p < 0.01). By leveraging the power of evolution, we also identified additional conserved genes in PMN-MDSCs of multiple species that may play a role in MDSC function. Our findings therefore validate the dog as a model for studying MDSCs in the context of cancer.",Phenotypic and transcriptomic characterization of canine myeloid-derived suppressor cells.
"The current study had three goals. First, we replicated recent evidence that suggests a concurrent relation between attention bias to reward and externalizing and attention problems at age 7. Second, we extended these findings by examining the relations between attention and behavioral measures of early exuberance (3 years), early effortful control (4 years), and concurrent effortful control (7 years), as well as later behavioral problems (9 years). Third, we evaluated the role of attention to reward in the longitudinal pathways between early exuberance and early effortful control to predict externalizing and attention problems. Results revealed that attention bias to reward was associated concurrently and longitudinally with behavioral problems. Moreover, greater reward bias was concurrently associated with lower levels of parent-reported effortful control. Finally, attention bias to reward moderated the longitudinal relations between early risk factors for behavioral problems (gender, exuberance, and effortful control) and later externalizing and attention problems, such that these early risk factors were most predictive of behavioral problems for males with a large attention bias to reward. These findings suggest that attention bias to reward may act as a moderator of early risk, aiding the identification of children at the highest risk for later behavioral problems.",Attention bias to reward predicts behavioral problems and moderates early risk to externalizing and attention problems.
"BACKGROUND: Attrition, or loss to follow-up, presents a significant threat to the integrity and validity of longitudinal clinical research. Little is known about predictors of attrition in neonatal clinical research, and no prior studies have examined how families' experiences participating in research with their infants influences study compliance. OBJECTIVE: To identify novel factors that were associated with attrition over 1 year of study follow-up among preterm infants enrolled in the multicenter Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) observational study. METHODS: At discharge, research coordinators estimated the likelihood of attrition. The parents completed questionnaires about their experience with the study at discharge and at 1 year corrected age. The primary endpoint was completion of 4 PROP interviews during the first year. Logistic models were used to evaluate the associations between infant, family, and center-based characteristics and attrition. RESULTS: Among 318 children, 283 (89%) met the primary endpoint. In bivariate analyses, lower maternal education, more people in the household, public insurance, and site were associated with attrition (p < 0.05). Parent survey responses, infant characteristics, and site characteristics were unrelated to attrition. Coordinators' prediction of attrition was associated with completion of early study interviews; this effect waned over time. In multivariable analyses, lower maternal education and more people in the household were the factors most strongly associated with attrition. CONCLUSION: Future neonatal research should evaluate novel strategies to decrease the burden associated with study participation and reinforcement of study goals with families who have lower educational levels to facilitate participation and decrease attrition bias.","Patient, Family, and Center-Based Factors Associated with Attrition in Neonatal Clinical Research: A Prospective Study."

"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Pediatric esophageal button battery (BB) injuries can progress even after removal and continue to be a significant source of morbidity and mortality. The objective in this case series is to present initial safety data for the human application of intraoperative tissue pH neutralization using 0.25% acetic acid irrigation after BB removal. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Pediatric patients who underwent rigid esophagoscopy for BB removal between October 2016 and December 2017 and who had the injury site irrigated with 120 to 150 mL sterile 0.25% acetic acid (pH = 3) were included in the study. Outcome measures included visual tissue appearance after irrigation, immediate or delayed esophageal perforation, and evidence of eventual esophageal stricture formation. RESULTS: Six pediatric patients (aged 19 months-10 years) had a 3 V lithium BB lodged in the esophagus for 2 to 18 hours and had irrigation of the esophageal injury site with sterile 0.25% acetic acid in the operating room after BB removal. None of the patients showed any evidence of thermal tissue injury. By surgeon assessment, all cases had improved visual esophageal tissue appearance. Neither immediate post-operative or delayed onset esophageal perforation nor eventual stricture development were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal irrigation in the operating room with sterile 0.25% acetic acid after BB removal, to neutralize the highly alkaline tissue microenvironment (pH 10-13) was safe and resulted in improved visual mucosal appearance. This immediate tissue pH neutralization may help halt the progression of liquefactive necrosis by immediately bringing tissue pH to physiologic range. This post-removal irrigation technique is recommended by current National Capital Poison Center BB guidelines.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; intraductal carcinoma) of the breast is commonly found in an asymptomatic woman on routine screening mammography. The purpose of this review is to describe current approaches to the management of DCIS as well as areas for future investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: Randomized trials have demonstrated that adding radiation treatment after breast conservation surgery (lumpectomy; surgical excision) reduces the rate of ipsilateral local recurrence by about half, and that adding hormonal therapy reduces the rate of all breast cancer events (ipsilateral plus contralateral). Early clinical studies attempted to stratify the risk of recurrence using conventional clinical and pathologic features. More recent clinical studies have attempted to define prospectively patients with lower risk DCIS for whom omission of radiation treatment after lumpectomy is a reasonable option. Molecular profiling is a newer approach to define risk stratification for DCIS. Combining molecular profiling with clinical and pathologic features appears to be more accurate in defining and stratifying the risk of recurrence after lumpectomy. After lumpectomy for DCIS, risk stratification using clinical and pathologic characteristics, and more recently molecular profiling, can help guide clinical decision-making for the use of radiation treatment and hormonal therapy. Ongoing studies are evaluating the possibility of de-escalating therapy, and in some studies, even using core biopsy alone, without surgical excision.",Management of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) of the Breast: Present Approaches and Future Directions.

"Imbalance is a major health problem affecting 90 million Americans and is the primary risk factor in falls, which consume $50 billion annually in medical costs (US). A person is often unaware of their balance challenge and its potential impact on fall risk and subsequent injury. Even when balance deficits and fall risk are realized, older patients may not pursue intervention for their disorder due to a fatalistic view of their advanced age. In this retrospective study, a cohort of older patients who had completed a course of vestibular rehabilitation therapy was studied for extent of recovery using computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) as the outcomes measure. The study group was comprised of sequential outpatients from a community-based balance treatment facility for whom pre- and posttherapy CDPs were available for analyses (N = 76). Patients had been referred for imbalance, vertigo, unsteadiness, and falls-age range 66 to 99 years (mean 80.5 years). Balance function, measured by composite sensory organization test (SOT) CDP scores, improved on average 35% ( P < .0001). Average posttherapy SOT score was 72.8, equivalent to the oldest SOT normative scores available (70 to 79 year age bracket; SOT Norm = 72.9). A subset 10 years above this eldest norm, mean age 89.4 years (N = 25, range 85 to 99 years), was then analyzed. Results revealed an improvement in balance function of 42.1% ( P < .0001), with average posttherapy SOT score of 74.2. Data confirm that vestibular therapy programs can significantly recover, if not normalize imbalance even to age 99. Given that the eldest participants were well above average life expectancy in the United States (78.9 years), this study could be used by allied health professionals to encourage older patients to engage in balance and falls prevention programs.",Managing Challenges in an Aging Vestibular System: Rehabilitation Strategies Normalize Balance Function in a Cohort of Patients Up to 99 Years.
"Visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-fat stored deep in the abdominal cavity that surrounds vital organs-is associated with a variety of chronic health conditions. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are the gold standards to quantify VAT. However, the high cost, limited accessibility, and potential exposure to radiation limit the use of these imaging modalities. In this commentary, we review the application of a previously validated regression equation that estimates anthropometrically predicted VAT (apVAT) to explain variance in blood-based biomarkers and predict mortality in a large sample of adults. In our first study (Brown et al. 2018 Eur J Nutr; doi:10.1007/s00394-016-1308-8), apVAT accounted for more variance in biomarkers of glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, than body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), or the combination of BMI + WC. In our second study (Brown et al. 2017 Am J Hum Biol; doi:10.1002/ajhb.22898), compared with BMI, WC, and BMI + WC, apVAT more accurately predicted mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. These studies demonstrate that apVAT can be used in clinical practice and in clinical nutrition and metabolism research when imaging modalities to quantify VAT may not be feasible.",The Value of Anthropometric Measures in Nutrition and Metabolism: Comment on Anthropometrically Predicted Visceral Adipose Tissue and Blood-Based Biomarkers: A Cross-Sectional Analysis.
"Chronic exposure to stress is associated with increased incidence of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. However, stress induces vulnerability to such disorders only in a sub-population of individuals, as others remain resilient. Inflammation has emerged as a putative mechanism for promoting stress vulnerability. Using a rodent model of social defeat, we have previously shown that rats with short-defeat latencies (SL/vulnerable rats) show increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and these behaviors are mediated by inflammation in the ventral hippocampus. The other half of socially defeated rats show long-latencies to defeat (LL/resilient) and are similar to controls. Because gut microbiota are important activators of inflammatory substances, we assessed the role of the gut microbiome in mediating vulnerability to repeated social defeat stress. We analyzed the fecal microbiome of control, SL/vulnerable, and LL/resilient rats using shotgun metagenome sequencing and observed increased expression of immune-modulating microbiota, such as Clostridia, in SL/vulnerable rats. We then tested the importance of gut microbiota to the SL/vulnerable phenotype. In otherwise naive rats treated with microbiota from SL/vulnerable rats, there was higher microglial density and IL-1beta expression in the vHPC, and higher depression-like behaviors relative to rats that received microbiota from LL/resilient rats, non-stressed control rats, or vehicle-treated rats. However, anxiety-like behavior during social interaction was not altered by transplant of the microbiome of SL/vulnerable rats into non-stressed rats. Taken together, the results suggest the gut microbiome contributes to the depression-like behavior and inflammatory processes in the vHPC of stress vulnerable individuals.",The gut microbiome regulates the increases in depressive-type behaviors and in inflammatory processes in the ventral hippocampus of stress vulnerable rats.
"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this nonrandomized, open-label, phase I study (NCT01285037) was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of merestinib, an oral antiproliferative and antiangiogenic kinase inhibitor, and to determine a recommended phase II dose and schedule for patients with advanced cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, phase I study of oral merestinib consisting of six parts: dose escalation (part A), followed by a four-cohort dose-confirmation study (part B) and subsequently a four-part dose expansion and combination safety testing of merestinib with standard doses of cetuximab (part C), cisplatin (part D), gemcitabine and cisplatin (part E), and ramucirumab (part F) in patients with specific types of advanced cancers. Safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, and pharmacokinetics were evaluated in all cohorts. RESULTS: The dose escalation, confirmation, and expansion results support the dosing of merestinib at 120 mg once daily, based on acceptable exposure and safety at this dose. One complete response was observed in a patient with cholangiocarcinoma, and three patients with cholangiocarcinoma achieved a partial response. Overall, 60 (32%) of the 186 patients enrolled in the study had a best response of stable disease. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that merestinib has a tolerable safety profile and potential anticancer activity and warrants further clinical investigation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Merestinib treatment in patients with advanced cancer demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and potential antitumor activity, supporting its future development in specific disease populations as a monotherapy and/or in combination with other therapies.","First-in-Human Phase I Study of Merestinib, an Oral Multikinase Inhibitor, in Patients with Advanced Cancer."
"Glucagon-containing alpha-cells potently regulate glucose homeostasis but the developmental biology of alpha-cells in adults remains poorly understood. While Glucagon receptor antagonists (GRAs) have great potential as anti-diabetic therapies, murine and human studies have raised concerns that GRAs might cause uncontrolled alpha-cell growth. Surprisingly, previous rodent GRA studies were only performed in young mice, implying that the potential impact of GRAs to drive alpha-cell expansion in adult patients is unclear. We assessed adaptive alpha-cell turnover and adaptive proliferation, administering a novel GRA (JNJ-46207382) to both young and aged mice. Basal alpha-cell proliferation rapidly declined soon after birth and continued to drop to very low levels in aged mice. GRA drove a 2.4-fold increase in alpha-cell proliferation in young mice. In contrast, GRA-induced alpha-cell proliferation was severely reduced in aged mice, although still present at 3.2-fold the very low basal rate of aged controls. To interrogate the lineage of GRA-induced alpha-cells, we sequentially administered thymidine analogues and quantified their incorporation into alpha-cells. Similar to previous studies of beta-cells, alpha-cells only divided once in both basal and stimulated conditions. Lack of contribution from highly proliferative 'transit amplifying' cells supports a model whereby alpha-cells expand by self-renewal and not via specialized progenitors.",Glucagon Receptor Antagonist Stimulated alpha-Cell Proliferation is Severely Restricted with Advanced Age.
"The establishment of efficient and stable splicing patterns in terminally differentiated cells is critical to maintenance of specific functions throughout the lifespan of an organism. The human (h)alpha-globin gene contains three exons separated by two short introns. Naturally occurring alpha-thalassemia mutations that trigger aberrant splicing have revealed the presence of cryptic splice sites within the halpha-globin gene transcript. How cognate (functional) splice sites are selectively utilized in lieu of these cryptic sites has remained unexplored. Here we demonstrate that the preferential selection of a cognate splice donor essential to functional splicing of the halpha-globin transcript is dependent on the actions of an intronic Cytosine (C)-rich splice regulatory determinant and its interacting polyC binding proteins. Inactivation of this determinant by mutation of the C-rich element or by depletion of PolyC binding proteins triggers a dramatic shift in splice donor activity to an upstream, out of frame, cryptic donor. The essential role of the C-rich element in halpha-globin gene expression is supported by its co-evolution with the cryptic donor site in primate species. These data lead us to conclude that an intronic C-rich determinant enforces functional splicing of the halpha-globin transcript, thus acting as an obligate determinant of halpha-globin gene expression.",A cytosine-rich splice-regulatory determinant enforces functional processing of the human alpha-globin gene transcript.
"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is associated with lower HbA1c in youth with type 2 diabetes taking oral medications only or after starting insulin for persistently elevated HbA1c. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: TODAY participants (n = 699) taking oral medications were asked to perform SMBG twice daily. After reaching primary outcome (PO) (HbA1c >/=8% [64 mmol/mol]) over 6 months or an inability to wean from temporary insulin because of metabolic decompensation), insulin glargine was started. HbA1c and percent of SMBG (SMBG%) (percent days when the meter was used one or more times) before and after PO were analyzed. RESULTS: SMBG declined over time and was inversely related to HbA1c (P < 0.0001). Of 298 youth who reached PO and started insulin, 282 had SMBG data. At PO, mean +/- SD age was 15.8 +/- 2.3 years, BMI 35.5 +/- 7.9 kg/m(2), and HbA1c 9.6 +/- 2.0% (81 +/- 21.9 mmol/mol); 65.3% were female. Median SMBG% was 40% at PO, which increased to 49% after 6 months and fell to 41% after 1 year on insulin. At PO, 22% of youth checked >/=80% of days, which increased to 25% and fell to 19% after 6 and 12 months using insulin, respectively. At PO, compared with those who checked <80%, youth who checked >/=80% were younger and with a lower BMI, HbA1c, and blood pressure. SMBG >/=80% was associated with >/=1% reduction in HbA1c at 6 and 12 months after insulin initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Low SMBG adherence was common and associated with higher HbA1c. Optimal SMBG frequency in youth using or not using insulin, and whether less frequent SMBG is a marker for overall worse self-care, require further study.",Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose in Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes: Results From the TODAY Study.
"CONTEXT: Celiac disease is characterized by deficits in bone mineral accrual and longitudinal growth. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the differences in bone health and stature among children and adolescents with celiac disease versus healthy controls. DATA SOURCES: Articles published before February 27, 2018 were located using searches of the Physical Education Index (n=186), PubMed (n=180), Scopus (n=3), SPORTDiscus (n=3), and Web of Science (n=4). STUDY SELECTION: Bone mineral content (BMC) and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) were assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and height was measured using a stadiometer. DATA EXTRACTION: Effect sizes (ES) were calculated as follows: the mean difference of the celiac disease group and healthy control group, divided by the pooled standard deviation. The inverse variance weight was used to calculate the overall mean ES. Random-effects models were used to aggregate a mean ES, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and to identify potential moderators. RESULTS: The results of 30 effects gathered from 12 studies published between 1996 and 2017 indicated BMC (ES=-0.54, 95% CI: -0.69 to -0.40; p < 0.0001) and aBMD (ES=0.72, 95% CI: -0.96 to -0.47; p < 0.0001) were lower in youth with celiac disease. LIMITATIONS: These results were limited to only cross-sectional and baseline data from longitudinal studies reporting BMC and BMD, however did not assess changes in bone health over time.

"Mammalian peroxiredoxin class 6 (Prdx6) are bifunctional enzymes. Non-mammalian Prdx6 enzymes display Cys-based peroxidase activity, but to date their putative phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2) activities) has not been experimentally investigated. Initially, we observed that five non-mammalian Prdx6 enzymes (enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPER1), Triticum aestivum (TaPER1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaLsfA) and Aspergillus fumigatus (AfPrx1 and AfPrxC)) present features compatible with PLA(2) activities in mammalian Prdx6 by amino acid sequences alignment and tertiary structure modeling. Employing unilamellar liposomes with tracer amounts of [(3)H]-1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and thin layer chromatography, all the tested non-mammalian Prdx6 enzymes displayed PLA(2) activities, with values ranging from 3.4 to 6.1 nmol/min/mg protein. It was previously shown that Thr177 phosphorylation of human Prdx6 increases its PLA(2) activity, especially at neutral pH. Therefore, we investigated if human Erk2 kinase could also phosphorylate homologous Thr residues in non-mammalian Prdx6 proteins. We observed phosphorylation of the conserved Thr in three out of the five non-mammalian Prdx enzymes by mass spectrometry. In the case of the mitochondrial Prdx6 from A. fumigatus (AfPrxC), we also observed phosphorylation by western blot, and as a consequence, the PLA(2) activity was increased in acidic and neutral conditions by the human Erk2 kinase treatment.

"OBJECTIVE: Children with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy (SCH) can develop proliferative retinopathy with vision loss, but lack of consensus exists regarding screening regimens. We sought to determine the prevalence, age at onset, and risk factors associated with sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) to inform development of screening guidelines for asymptomatic children. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: Children with SCH over a 4-year period. METHODS: Prevalences of any retinopathy, non-proliferative retinopathy, and proliferative retinopathy, determined as proportions of all children examined, were calculated. Subgroup analyses were completed by SCH genotype. Ages at first diagnosis were reported using standard descriptive statistics. The association of potential risk factors with retinopathy were assessed using univariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were prevalence, age at onset, and type of SCR, based upon examination by an ophthalmologist. Markers of SCH severity (number of ER or hospital admissions for crises, number of blood transfusions, hydroyxurea therapy, transcranial Doppler-confirmed cerebral vasculopathy), genotype, gender, and race were evaluated as SCR risk factors. RESULTS: Of 398 children (mean age 9.6 +/- 4.6 years, range 0-18), 208 (52%) had SS, 113 (28%) SC, and 77 (19%) trait. 48 (12.1%) children had SCR; 44/398 (11.1%, 95% CI 8.3%-14.5%) had non-proliferative retinopathy, and 9/398 (2.3%, 1.2%-4.2%) had proliferative retinopathy. Prevalence was higher for SC than SS for non-proliferative retinopathy (21% vs. 9%) and proliferative retinopathy (5% vs. 1%); onset for SC was earlier than SS for non-proliferative retinopathy (4.8 vs. 6.1 years) and proliferative retinopathy (12.2 vs. 15.4 years). No other risk factors were significantly associated with SCR. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical markers of SCH severity assessed were not associated with SCR and are not necessary for screening guidelines. Based upon our study and literature review, while screening could begin at age 5 years for non-proliferative retinopathy, screening of children without ophthalmologic symptoms to identify treatment-requiring proliferative retinopathy could begin later, at age 9 years for SC and age 13 years for SS.",Prevalence and Onset of Pediatric Sickle Cell Retinopathy.
"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate safety outcomes from clinical studies of a 12-month contraceptive vaginal system (CVS) releasing an average of segesterone acetate (SA) 150 mcg and ethinyl estradiol (EE) 13 mcg daily. STUDY DESIGN: We integrated clinical safety data from nine studies in which women used the CVS for 21 consecutive days and removed it for 7days of each 28-daycycle. Four studies used the final manufactured CVS, including a one-year pharmacokinetic study, two one-year phase 3 trials, and a second-year treatment extension study. We assessed safety by evaluating adverse events women reported in a daily diary. We also included data from focused safety studies evaluating endometrial biopsies, vaginal microbiology, and liver proteins from one of the phase 3 studies. RESULTS: The combined studies included 3052 women; 2308 women (mean age 26.7+/-5.1years; mean BMI 24.1+/-3.7kg/m(2)) received the final manufactured CVS of whom 999 (43.3%) completed 13cycles of use. Women using the final CVS most commonly reported adverse events of headache (n=601, 26%), nausea (n=420, 18%), vaginal discharge/vulvovaginal mycotic infection (n=242,10%), and abdominal pain (n=225, 10%). Few (<1.5%) women discontinued for these complaints. Four (0.2%) women experienced venous thromboembolism (VTE), three of whom had risk factors for thrombosis (Factor V Leiden mutation [n=1]; BMI>29kg/m(2) [n=2]). During 21,482 treatment cycles in the phase 3 studies evaluable for expulsion, women reported partial expulsions in 4259 (19.5%) cycles and complete expulsions in 1509 (7%) cycles, most frequently in the initial cycle (499/2050 [24.3%] and 190/2050 [9.3%], respectively). Safety-focused studies revealed no safety concerns. CONCLUSION: The one-year SA/EE CVS has an acceptable safety profile. Additional studies are warranted in obese women at higher risk of VTE. IMPLICATIONS: This one-year contraceptive vaginal system represents a new long-term, user-controlled, and procedure-free option with a safety profile similar to other combination hormonal contraceptives. The same precautions currently used for combination hormonal contraceptive prescriptions apply to this new contraceptive vaginal system.",Segesterone acetate/Ethinyl estradiol 12-month contraceptive vaginal system safety evaluation.

"OBJECTIVE: Revised diagnostic criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) were proposed in part to reduce misdiagnosis of intracranial hypertension without papilledema (WOP) by using 3 or 4 MRI features of intracranial hypertension when a sixth nerve palsy is absent. This study was undertaken to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the MRI criteria and to validate their utility for diagnosing IIH in patients with chronic headaches and elevated opening pressure (CH + EOP), but WOP. METHODS: Brain MRIs from 80 patients with IIH with papilledema (WP), 33 patients with CH + EOP, and 70 control patients with infrequent episodic migraine were assessed in a masked fashion for MRI features of intracranial hypertension. RESULTS: Reduced pituitary gland height was moderately sensitive for IIH WP (80%) but had low specificity (64%). Increased optic nerve sheath diameter was less sensitive (51%) and only moderately specific (83%). Flattening of the posterior globe was highly specific (97%) but had low sensitivity (57%). Transverse venous sinus stenosis was moderately sensitive for IIH WP (78%) but of undetermined specificity. A combination of any 3 of 4 MRI features was nearly 100% specific, while maintaining a sensitivity of 64%. Of patients with CH + EOP, 30% had 3 or more MRI features, suggesting IIH WOP in those patients. CONCLUSION: A combination of any 3 of 4 MRI features is highly specific for intracranial hypertension and suggests IIH WOP when present in patients with chronic headache and no papilledema.",Utility of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Features for Improving the Diagnosis of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Without Papilledema.
"With the development of anesthesiology, patient safety has been remarkably improved, but the postoperative mortality rate at 30 days is still as high as 0.56%-4%, and the morbidity is even higher. Three years ago, the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology proposed that the direction of the anesthesiology development should be changed to perioperative medicine in China. Anesthesiologists should pay more attention to the long-term outcome. In this article, we introduced what we have done, what the challenges are, and what we should do in the future with regard to the practice of perioperative medicine in China.",Road to Perioperative Medicine: A Perspective From China.
"BACKGROUND: Premature neonates are often subjected to multiple transfusions with red blood cells during their hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The hemoglobin threshold for transfusion prior to discharge from the NICU varies significantly among different centers. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between hemoglobin concentration at discharge with neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature neonates. METHODS: Retrospective observation study with regression analysis was performed with follow up assessment in the neuro-developmental outpatient clinic at 30 months of adjusted age. RESULTS: Data from 357 neonates born at less than 37 weeks' gestation were analyzed. Sensory and motor neurodevelopment at 30 months of adjusted age, were not associated with the hemoglobin concentration at discharge (p=0.5891 and p=0.4575, respectively). There was no association between the hemoglobin concentration at discharge with fine or gross motor development (p=0.1582 and p=0.3805, respectively). Hemoglobin concentration at discharge was not associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes up until 30 months of adjusted age. CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present study indicate that the hemoglobin concentration of premature neonates at the time of discharge is not associated with poorer markers of neurodevelopmental outcomes at 30 months of adjusted age. Comorbidities such as BPD and IVH that are present to premature neonates were identified as potential risk factors for certain aspects of the neurodevelopment.",Association between hemoglobin concentrations at discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit with markers of neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature neonates.
"The human gut microbiota plays a vital role in both human health and disease. Studying the gut microbiota using an in vivo model, is difficult due to its complex nature, and its diverse association with mammalian components. The goal of this protocol is to culture the gut microbiota in vitro, which allows for the study of the gut microbiota dynamics, without having to consider the contribution of the mammalian milieu. Using in vitro culturing technology, the physiological conditions of the gastro intestinal tract are simulated, including parameters such as pH, temperature, anaerobiosis, and transit time. The intestinal surface of the colon is simulated by adding mucin-coated carriers, creating a mucosal phase, and adding further dimension. The gut microbiota is introduced by inoculating with the human fecal material. Upon inoculation with this complex mixture of bacteria, specific microbes are enriched in the different longitudinal (ascending, transverse and descending colons) and transversal (luminal and mucosal) environments of the in vitro model. It is crucial to allow the system to reach a steady state, in which the community and the metabolites produced remain stable. The experimental results in this manuscript demonstrate how the inoculated gut microbiota community develops into a stable community over time. Once steady state is achieved, the system can be used to analyze bacterial interactions and community functions or to test the effects of any additives on the gut microbiota, such as food, food components, or pharmaceuticals.",Applying Advanced In Vitro Culturing Technology to Study the Human Gut Microbiota.

"Drivers' population-level crash rates incrementally decrease following licensure, which has led to the implicit assumption that an individual driver's crash risk also decreases incrementally after licensure as they accrue experience. However, in the aggregate data an incremental decrease in crash rate can reflect both incremental reductions in crash risk within individuals and an incremental increase in the proportion of drivers who have experienced an abrupt decrease in crash risk. Therefore, while it is true to say that the population of drivers' crash risk reduces in the months following licensure, it is not necessarily true to say that a driver's crash risk reduces in the months following licensure; that is, it cannot be assumed that individual-level changes in crash risk mirror the population-level changes in crash rates. In statistics, this is known as an ecological fallacy and in formal logic it is known as the fallacy of division, a type of category error. Using computational cognitive modeling methods we demonstrate that aggregating individual-level abrupt decreases in crash risk (i.e., non-incremental change trajectories) accurately fits population-level crash rate data from over 1 million adolescents and uniquely accounts for effects of two interventions found to reduce police-reported MVCs. Thus, we demonstrate that (1) a power-law artifact is readily observable in newly licensed drivers' aggregate crash data, which is not necessarily indicative of individual-level change processes, (2) interventions can alter crash risk trajectories by inducing immediate phase changes in crash risk into a lower risk stratum, or increasing the probability of such a change, (3) a phase transition model provides a stronger and more parsimonious account of the existing data than an incremental-accrual model.",Learning to drive: A reconceptualization.
"Background: Obesity is a growing public health problem. Obesity increases the risk of requiring total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of obesity on the propensity for TJA in patients at our institution. We hypothesized that obese patients would be younger and more likely to be races other than non-Hispanic whites when compared to a normal weight cohort. Methods: 568 consecutive patients undergoing primary TJA were reviewed. Demographic data and World Health Organization Body Mass Index (BMI) class were compared statistically, with age at time of TJA used as the main outcome of interest. Results: The average age at TKA was 68.3 years, while the average age at THA was 67.5 years (p=0.447 between procedure groups). Increased BMI class was associated with decreased age at TJA: normal weight patients were 12.2 and 11.4 years older than class III obese patients at the time of TKA and THA, respectively (p<0.001). Among TKA patients, obese patients, when compared to non-obese patients, were significantly less likely to be non-Hispanic whites (p=0.016). Among THA patients, class III obese patients were significantly less likely to be non-Hispanic whites (p=0.007). Conclusions: Obesity is a risk factor for both TKA and THA at a younger age. For patients in the study, for each unit increase in BMI, the age at TKA decreased by 0.56 years and age at THA decreased by 0.52 years. Obese patients were less likely to be non-Hispanic whites than normal weight patients.",Obesity and racial characteristics drive utilization of total joint arthroplasty at a younger age.
"The alignment of fasting and feeding with the sleep/wake cycle is coordinated by hypothalamic neurons, though the underlying molecular programs remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that the clock transcription pathway maximizes eating during wakefulness and glucose production during sleep through autonomous circadian regulation of NPY/AgRP neurons. Tandem profiling of whole-cell and ribosome-bound mRNAs in morning and evening under dynamic fasting and fed conditions identified temporal control of activity-dependent gene repertoires in AgRP neurons central to synaptogenesis, bioenergetics, and neurotransmitter and peptidergic signaling. Synaptic and circadian pathways were specific to whole-cell RNA analyses, while bioenergetic pathways were selectively enriched in the ribosome-bound transcriptome. Finally, we demonstrate that the AgRP clock mediates the transcriptional response to leptin. Our results reveal that time-of-day restriction in transcriptional control of energy-sensing neurons underlies the alignment of hunger and food acquisition with the sleep/wake state.",Transcriptional Basis for Rhythmic Control of Hunger and Metabolism within the AgRP Neuron.
"Ubiquitylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) that controls various cellular signaling pathways. It is orchestrated by a three-step enzymatic cascade know as the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). E3 ligases dictate the specificity to the substrates, primarily leading to proteasome-dependent degradation. Deregulation of the UPS components by various mechanisms contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer. This review focuses on E3 ligase-substrates pairings that are implicated in B-cell malignancies. Understanding the molecular mechanism of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases will present potential opportunities for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches.",E3 ubiquitin ligases in B-cell malignancies.
"Gene expression is tightly regulated at the post-transcriptional level through splicing, transport, translation, and decay. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, and genetic variants that alter RBP-RNA interactions can affect gene products and functions. We developed a computational method ASPRIN (Allele-Specific Protein-RNA Interaction) that uses a joint analysis of CLIP-seq (cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing) and RNA-seq data to identify genetic variants that alter RBP-RNA interactions by directly observing the allelic preference of RBP from CLIP-seq experiments as compared to RNA-seq. We used ASPRIN to systematically analyze CLIP-seq and RNA-seq data for 166 RBPs in two ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) cell lines. ASPRIN identified genetic variants that alter RBP-RNA interactions by modifying RBP binding motifs within RNA. Moreover, through an integrative ASPRIN analysis with population-scale RNA-seq data, we showed that ASPRIN can help reveal potential causal variants that affect alternative splicing via allele-specific protein-RNA interactions.",Discovery of Allele-Specific Protein-RNA Interactions in Human Transcriptomes.
"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the public disclosure of industry payments to physicians on patients' awareness of industry payments and knowledge about whether their physicians had accepted industry payments. DESIGN: Interrupted time series with comparison group (difference-in-difference analyses of longitudinal survey). SETTING: Nationally representative US population-based surveys. Surveys were conducted in September 2014, shortly prior to the public release of Open Payments information, and again in September 2016. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18 and older (n=2180). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Awareness of industry payments as an issue; awareness that industry payments information was publicly available; knowledge of whether own physician had received industry payments. RESULTS: Public disclosure of industry payments information through Open Payments did not significantly increase the proportion of respondents who knew whether their physician had received industry payments (p=0.918). It also did not change the proportion of respondents who became aware of the issue of industry payments (p=0.470) but did increase the proportion who knew that payments information was publicly available (9.6% points, p=0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Two years after the public disclosure of industry payments information, Open Payments does not appear to have achieved its goal of increasing patient knowledge of whether their physicians have received money from pharmaceutical and medical device firms. Additional efforts will be required to improve the use and effectiveness of Open Payments for consumers.",Effect of the public disclosure of industry payments information on patients: results from a population-based natural experiment.
"Much evidence suggests that hypofunction of the N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) may contribute broadly towards a subset of molecular, cognitive and behavioral abnormalities common among psychiatric and developmental diseases. However, little is known about the specific molecular changes that lead to NMDAR dysfunction. As such, personalized approaches to remediating NMDAR dysfunction based on a specific etiology remains a challenge. Sarcoma tyrosine kinase (Src) serves as a hub for multiple signaling mechanisms affecting GluN2 phosphorylation and can be disrupted by convergent alterations of various signaling pathways. We recently showed reduced Src signaling in post mortem tissue from schizophrenia patients, despite increased MK-801 binding and NMDA receptor complex expression in the postsynaptic density (PSD). These data suggest that Src dysregulation may be an important underlying mechanism responsible for reduced glutamate signaling. Despite this evidence for a central role of Src in NMDAR signaling, little is known about how reductions in Src activity might regulate phenotypic changes in cognition and behavior. As such, the current study sought to characterize behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes in mice heterozygous for the Src Acl gene (Src+/- mice). Src+/- mice demonstrated decreased sociability and working memory relative to Src+/+ (WT) mice while no significant differences were seen on locomotive activity and anxiety-related behavior. In relation to WT mice, Src+/- mice showed decreased mid-latency P20 auditory event related potential (aERP) amplitudes, decreased mismatch negativity (MMN) and decreased evoked gamma power, which was only present in males. These data indicate that Src+/- mice are a promising new model to help understand the pathophysiology of these electrophysiological, behavioral and cognitive changes. As such, we propose that Src+/- mice can be used in the future to evaluate potential therapeutic approaches by targeting increased Src activity as a common final pathway for multiple etiologies of SCZ and other diseases characterized by reduced glutamate function.",Src deficient mice demonstrate behavioral and electrophysiological alterations relevant to psychiatric and developmental disease.
"TDP-43 proteinopathy is a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia where cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions are observed within degenerating regions of patient postmortem tissue. The mechanism by which TDP-43 aggregates has remained elusive due to technological limitations, which prevent the analysis of specific TDP-43 interactions in live cells. We present an optogenetic approach to reliably induce TDP-43 proteinopathy under spatiotemporal control. We show that the formation of pathologically relevant inclusions is driven by aberrant interactions between low-complexity domains of TDP-43 that are antagonized by RNA binding. Although stress granules are hypothesized to be a conduit for seeding TDP-43 proteinopathy, we demonstrate pathological inclusions outside these RNA-rich structures. Furthermore, we show that aberrant phase transitions of cytoplasmic TDP-43 are neurotoxic and that treatment with oligonucleotides composed of TDP-43 target sequences prevent inclusions and rescue neurotoxicity. Collectively, these studies provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie TDP-43 proteinopathy and present a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention.",RNA Binding Antagonizes Neurotoxic Phase Transitions of TDP-43.
"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine whether the association between maternal smoking and gestational hypertension varies by the timing of exposure. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of women identified in 2015 US natality records for singleton births. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Our outcome was whether a woman was diagnosed with gestational hypertension (GH) on the birth record, a category which includes preeclampsia. RESULTS: Women who smoked before and during pregnancy had a reduced risk for GH relative to non-smokers (adjusted RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.90-0.94). In contrast, women who apparently quit just before the start of pregnancy had higher risk than non-smokers (adjusted RR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.05). When the trimester-specific effects were examined, only women who smoked before pregnancy and in all three trimesters had reduced risk for GH. Smoking mothers who quit just before the start of the 3rd trimester had an increased risk for GH compared to non-smokers (adjusted RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.16). CONCLUSION: In our analysis, women who smoked before pregnancy and in all three trimesters have reduced risk of GH compared to non-smokers, while smokers who reported quitting before pregnancy were at an increased risk. Our results offer new insights into the importance of timing of smoking in pregnancy on risk of GH, and challenge the notion that any smoking during pregnancy has a protective effect.",Maternal smoking and gestational hypertension: Heterogeneous effect by timing of the exposure.
"It remains unknown when, where, and how the site of abscission is generated during cytokinesis. Here, we show that the sites of constriction, i.e., the sites of future abscission, are initially formed at the ends of the intercellular bridge during early midbody stage, and that these sites are associated with the non-muscle myosin-IIB (not myosin-IIA), actin filaments, and septin 9 until abscission. The ESCRT-III component CHMP4B localizes to the midbody and ""spreads"" to the site of abscission only during late midbody stage. Strikingly, inhibition of myosin-II motor activity by a low dose of Blebbistatin completely abolishes the formation of the constriction sites, resulting in the localization of all the above-mentioned components to the midbody region. These data strongly suggest that a secondary actomyosin ring provides the primary driving force for the thinning of the intercellular bridge to allow ESCRT-mediated membrane fission.",Non-muscle Myosin-II Is Required for the Generation of a Constriction Site for Subsequent Abscission.
"Electronic health record (EHR) data provide promising opportunities to explore personalized treatment regimes and to make clinical predictions. Compared with regular clinical data, EHR data are known for their irregularity and complexity. In addition, analyzing EHR data involves privacy issues and sharing such data is often infeasible among multiple research sites due to regulatory and other hurdles. A recently published work uses contextual embedding models and successfully builds one predictive model for more than seventy common diagnoses. Despite of the high predictive power, the model cannot be generalized to other institutions without sharing data. In this work, a novel method is proposed to learn from multiple databases and build predictive models based on Distributed Noise Contrastive Estimation (Distributed NCE). We use differential privacy to safeguard the intermediary information sharing. The numerical study with a real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method not only can build predictive models in a distributed manner with privacy protection, but also preserve model structure well and achieve comparable prediction accuracy. The proposed methods have been implemented as a stand-alone Python library and the implementation is available on Github (https://github.com/ziyili20/DistributedLearningPredictor) with installation instructions and use-cases.",Distributed Learning from Multiple EHR Databases: Contextual Embedding Models for Medical Events.
"Inherited retinal disorders (IRD) represent clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases. To date, pathogenic variants have been identified in ~ 260 genes. Albeit that many genes are implicated in IRD, for 30-50% of the cases the gene defect is unknown. These cases may be explained by novel gene defects, by overlooked copy number variations, by variants in intronic or promoter regions or represent synonymous variants of known genes contributing to the dysfunction of the respective proteins. Patients with one subgroup of IRD, namely incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (icCSNB) show a very specific phenotype. The major cause of this condition is the presence of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in CACNA1F. A comprehensive study applying direct Sanger sequencing of gene coding regions, exome and genome sequencing applied to a large cohort of patients with a clinical diagnosis of icCSNB revealed indeed that 7 of 189 CACNA1F-related cases have intronic and synonymous disease causing variants leading to missplicing as validated by mini-gene approaches. These findings highlight that gene locus sequencing may be a very efficient method in detecting disease-causing variants in clinically well characterized patients with a diagnosis of IRD, like icCSNB.

"Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder among adults, especially affecting individuals of advanced age or with neurodegenerative disease. Insomnia is also a common comorbidity across psychiatric disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for insomnia; a key component of this intervention is restriction of sleep opportunity, which optimizes matching of sleep ability and opportunity, leading to enhanced sleep drive. Despite the well-documented efficacy of CBT-I, little is known regarding how CBT-I works at a cellular and molecular level to improve sleep, due in large part to an absence of experimentally-tractable animals models of this intervention. Here, guided by human behavioral sleep therapies, we developed a Drosophila model for sleep restriction therapy (SRT) of insomnia. We demonstrate that restriction of sleep opportunity through manipulation of environmental cues improves sleep efficiency in multiple short-sleeping Drosophila mutants. The response to sleep opportunity restriction requires ongoing environmental inputs, but is independent of the molecular circadian clock. We apply this sleep opportunity restriction paradigm to aging and Alzheimer's disease fly models, and find that sleep impairments in these models are reversible with sleep restriction, with associated improvement in reproductive fitness and extended lifespan. This work establishes a model to investigate the neurobiological basis of CBT-I, and provides a platform that can be exploited toward novel treatment targets for insomnia.",A Drosophila model of sleep restriction therapy for insomnia.
"OBJECTIVE: Few factors have consistently been linked to antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis (ARLA). We sought to identify clinical and treatment factors associated with pediatric ARLA. METHODS: We performed a case-control study in 3 pediatric rheumatology clinics in a Lyme-endemic region (2000-2013). Eligible children were aged </= 18 years with arthritis and had positive testing for Lyme disease by Western blot. Cases were 49 children with persistently active arthritis despite >/= 8 weeks of oral antibiotics or >/= 2 weeks of parenteral antibiotics; controls were 188 children whose arthritis resolved within 3 months of starting antibiotics. We compared preselected demographic, clinical, and treatment factors between groups using logistic regression. RESULTS: Characteristics positively associated with ARLA were age >/= 10 years, prolonged arthritis at diagnosis, knee-only arthritis, and worsening after starting antibiotics. In contrast, children with fever, severe pain, or other signs of systemic inflammation were more likely to respond quickly to treatment. Secondarily, low-dose amoxicillin and treatment nonadherence were also linked to higher risk of ARLA. Greater antibiotic use for children with ARLA was accompanied by higher rates of treatment-associated adverse events (37% vs 15%) and resultant hospitalization (6% vs 1%). CONCLUSION: Older children and those with prolonged arthritis, arthritis limited to the knees, or poor initial response to antibiotics are more likely to have antibiotic-refractory disease and treatment-associated toxicity. Children with severe symptoms of systemic inflammation have more favorable outcomes. For children with persistently active Lyme arthritis after 2 antibiotic courses, pediatricians should consider starting antiinflammatory treatment and referring to a pediatric rheumatologist.",Pediatric Antibiotic-refractory Lyme Arthritis: A Multicenter Case-control Study.

"Genome-wide association studies found genetic variations with modulatory effects for intracranial aneurysm (IA) formations in European and Japanese populations. We aimed to identify the susceptibility of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to IA in a Korean population consisting of 250 patients, and 294 controls using the Asian-specific Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array. Twenty-nine SNPs reached a genome-wide significance threshold (5 x 10(-8)). The rs371331393 SNP, with a stop-gain function of ARHGAP32 (11q24.3), showed the most significant association with the risk of IA (OR = 43.57, 95% CI: 21.84(-)86.95; p = 9.3 x 10(-27)).

"INTRODUCTION: Diffuse gliomas are incurable malignancies, which undergo inevitable progression and are associated with seizure in 50-90% of cases. Glutamate has the potential to be an important glioma biomarker of survival and local epileptogenicity if it can be accurately quantified noninvasively. METHODS: We applied the glutamate-weighted imaging method GluCEST (glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer) and single voxel MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) at 7Telsa (7T) to patients with gliomas. GluCEST contrast and MRS metabolite concentrations were quantified within the tumour region and peritumoural rim. Clinical variables of tumour aggressiveness (prior adjuvant therapy and previous radiological progression) and epilepsy (any prior seizures, seizure in last month and drug refractory epilepsy) were correlated with respective glutamate concentrations. Images were separated into post-hoc determined patterns and clinical variables were compared across patterns. RESULTS: Ten adult patients with a histo-molecular (n=9) or radiological (n=1) diagnosis of grade II-III diffuse glioma were recruited, 40.3 +/- 12.3years. Increased tumour GluCEST contrast was associated with prior adjuvant therapy (p=.001), and increased peritumoural GluCEST contrast was associated with both recent seizures (p=.038) and drug refractory epilepsy (p=.029). We distinguished two unique GluCEST contrast patterns with distinct clinical and radiological features. MRS glutamate correlated with GluCEST contrast within the peritumoural voxel (R=0.89, p=.003) and a positive trend existed in the tumour voxel (R=0.65, p=.113). CONCLUSION: This study supports the role of glutamate in diffuse glioma biology. It further implicates elevated peritumoural glutamate in epileptogenesis and altered tumour glutamate homeostasis in glioma aggressiveness. Given the ability to non-invasively visualise and quantify glutamate, our findings raise the prospect of 7T GluCEST selecting patients for individualised therapies directed at the glutamate pathway. Larger studies with prospective follow-up are required.",Glutamate weighted imaging contrast in gliomas with 7Tesla magnetic resonance imaging.
"Identifying triggers for challenging behavior is difficult in some children with autism because of their limited communication abilities. Physiological indicators of stress may provide important insights. This study examined whether heart rate (HR) predicts challenging behavior in children with autism. While wearing an electrocardiograph monitor, 41 children with autism aged 2- to 4-years participated in tasks designed to induce low-level stress (e.g. waiting for a snack). Coders identified 106 time periods during which challenging behaviors occurred and also coded 106 randomly selected time samples that did not include challenging behaviors. Thirteen (32%) participants exhibited challenging behaviors and were included in the study. Baseline-corrected HR was computed for each behavior/time sample. On average, children with autism showed a 22 +/- 16% HR increase from baseline 58 +/- 22 seconds before the onset of a challenging behavior episode. Peak HR change had moderate predictive utility (area under the curve = .72, p < .001). The increase in HR before challenging behaviors was similar for children of different characteristics (age, autism severity, expressive language ability, overall developmental ability). Results highlight the promise of using physiological stress to predict challenging behavior in preschoolers with autism; although, they need to be replicated in larger samples. Given recent advances in wearable biosensing, it may be useful to incorporate HR monitoring in autism intervention. Lay summary In children with autism, changes in heart rate (HR) may help us predict when challenging behavior is about to occur - but this hypothesis has not been well studied. In this study, HR increase moderately predicted challenging behavior in preschoolers with autism. Given recent advances in wearable sensors, it may be useful to incorporate HR monitoring in autism intervention.",Heart rate increase predicts challenging behavior episodes in preschoolers with autism.

METHOD: Parents of youth receiving neuropsychological evaluation completed questionnaires at four time points (prior to evaluation [n = 363], day of testing [n = 300], prior to feedback [n = 250], and post-report [n = 99]). Parents rated aspects of their knowledge and efficacy regarding their child's functioning. Parents also rated their perception of the neuropsychologist, medical provider, and school along the same domains. The resulting longitudinal data were analyzed using structural equation modeling and ANCOVA. Although primary analyses focused on the entire sample, differences between first-time evaluations and re-evaluations were also examined. RESULTS: Families receiving an initial evaluation showed lower ratings in knowledge, awareness of options, and efficacy at the beginning of the evaluation and a significant increase in ratings by the end of the evaluation. Families returning for re-evaluation showed higher initial ratings that changed comparatively little during the evaluation. Parents receiving initial evaluations also perceived increased knowledge of their child by medical providers and school. CONCLUSION: The study supports the clinical assumption that parents gain knowledge about their child and treatment options during a neuropsychological evaluation. The difference between initial and re-evaluation warrants further study. Studying the process and experience of neuropsychological evaluation may provide more nuanced findings than post hoc satisfaction measures.",Evolution of parental knowledge and efficacy across the pediatric neuropsychological evaluation process.
"The prevalence of obesity increases with age in humans and in rodents. Age-related obesity is characterized by leptin resistance and associated with heightened risk of metabolic disorders. However, the effect of leptin resistance per se has been difficult to disentangle from other effects of aging. Here we demonstrate that celastrol, a natural phytochemical that was previously shown to act as a leptin sensitizer, induces weight loss in aged animals, but not in young controls. Celastrol reduces food intake and lowers fasting glucose without affecting energy expenditure. Unexpectedly, administration of celastrol just before the dark period disrupted circadian rhythms of sleep and activity. This regimen was also associated with loss of lean mass an outcome that would not be desirable in elderly patients. Adjusting the timing of celastrol administration by 12 hr, to the beginning of the light period, avoided interference with circadian rhythms while retaining the reductions in body weight and adiposity. Thus, targeting leptin signaling is an effective strategy to ameliorate age-associated weight gain, and can profoundly impact circadian rhythms.",The leptin sensitizer celastrol reduces age-associated obesity and modulates behavioral rhythms.
"Brain lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) include amyloid plaques made of Abeta peptides and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein with synaptic and neuronal loss and neuroinflammation. Abeta oligomers can trigger tau phosphorylation and neuronal alterations through activation of neuronal kinases leading to progressive cognitive decline. PKR is a ubiquitous pro-apoptotic serine/threonine kinase, and levels of activated PKR are increased in AD brains and AD CSF. In addition, PKR regulates negatively memory formation in mice. To assess the role of PKR in an AD in vivo model, we crossed 5xFAD transgenic mice with PKR knockout (PKRKO) mice and we explored the contribution of PKR on cognition and brain lesions in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD as well as in neuron-microglia co-cultures exposed to the innate immunity activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Nine-month-old double-mutant mice revealed significantly improved memory consolidation with the new object location test, starmaze test, and elevated plus maze test as compared to 5xFAD mice. Brain amyloid accumulation and BACE1 levels were statistically decreased in double-mutant mice. Apoptosis, neurodegeneration markers, and synaptic alterations were significantly reduced in double-mutant mice as well as neuroinflammation markers such as microglial load and brain cytokine levels. Using cocultures, we found that PKR in neurons was essential for LPS microglia-induced neuronal death. Our results demonstrate the clear involvement of PKR in abnormal spatial memory and brain lesions in the 5xFAD model and underline its interest as a target for neuroprotection in AD.",PKR knockout in the 5xFAD model of Alzheimer's disease reveals beneficial effects on spatial memory and brain lesions.
"PURPOSE: To integrate markerless head motion tracking with prospectively corrected neuroanatomical MRI sequences and to investigate high-frequency motion correction during imaging echo trains. METHODS: A commercial 3D surface tracking system, which estimates head motion by registering point cloud reconstructions of the face, was used to adapt the imaging FOV based on head movement during MPRAGE and T2 SPACE (3D variable flip-angle turbo spin-echo) sequences. The FOV position and orientation were updated every 6 lines of k-space (< 50 ms) to enable ""within-echo-train"" prospective motion correction (PMC). Comparisons were made with scans using ""before-echo-train"" PMC, in which the FOV was updated only once per TR, before the start of each echo train (ET). Continuous-motion experiments with phantoms and in vivo were used to compare these high-frequency and low-frequency correction strategies. MPRAGE images were processed with FreeSurfer to compare estimates of brain structure volumes and cortical thickness in scans with different PMC. RESULTS: The median absolute pose differences between markerless tracking and MR image registration were 0.07/0.26/0.15 mm for x/y/z translation and 0.06 masculine/0.02 masculine/0.12 degrees for rotation about x/y/z. The PMC with markerless tracking substantially reduced motion artifacts. The continuous-motion experiments showed that within-ET PMC, which minimizes FOV encoding errors during ETs that last over 1 second, reduces artifacts compared with before-ET PMC. T2 SPACE was found to be more sensitive to motion during ETs than MPRAGE. FreeSurfer morphometry estimates from within-ET PMC MPRAGE images were the most accurate. CONCLUSION: Markerless head tracking can be used for PMC, and high-frequency within-ET PMC can reduce sensitivity to motion during long imaging ETs.",Markerless high-frequency prospective motion correction for neuroanatomical MRI.
"BACKGROUND: Conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) is a common therapy for neonatal respiratory failure. While CMV facilitates gas exchange, it may simultaneously injure the lungs. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has received less attention than other ventilation parameters when considering this benefit-risk balance. While an appropriate PEEP level may result in clinical benefits, both inappropriately low or high levels may cause harm. An appropriate PEEP level may also be best achieved by an individualized approach. OBJECTIVES: 1. To compare the effects of PEEP levels in preterm infants requiring CMV for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). We compare both: zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) (0 cm H2O) versus any PEEP and low (< 5 cm H2O) vs high (>/= 5 cm H2O) PEEP.2. To compare the effects of PEEP levels in preterm infants requiring CMV for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We compare both: ZEEP (0 cm H2O) vs any PEEP and low (< 5 cm H2O) versus high (>/= 5 cm H2O) PEEP.3. To compare the effects of different methods for individualizing PEEP to an optimal level in preterm newborn infants requiring CMV for RDS. SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to 14 February 2018. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials studying preterm infants born at less than 37 weeks' gestational age, requiring CMV and undergoing randomization to either different PEEP levels (RDS or BPD); or, two or more alternative methods for individualizing PEEP levels (RDS only). We included cross-over trials but limited outcomes to those from the first cross-over period. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We performed data collection and analysis according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for prespecified key clinically relevant outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials met the inclusion criteria. Two cross-over trials with 28 participants compared different PEEP levels in infants with RDS. Meta-analysis was limited to short-term measures of pulmonary gas exchange and showed no differences between low and high PEEP.We identified no trials comparing PEEP levels in infants with BPD.Two trials enrolling 44 participants compared different methods for individualizing PEEP in infants with RDS. Both trials compared an oxygenation-guided lung-recruitment maneuver (LRM) with gradual PEEP level titrations for individualizing PEEP to routine care (control). Meta-analysis showed no difference between LRM and control on mortality by hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 5.77); there was no statistically significant difference on BPD, with an effect estimate favoring LRM (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.07); and a statistically significant difference favoring LRM for the outcome of duration of ventilatory support (mean difference -1.06 days, 95% CI -1.85 to -0.26; moderate heterogeneity, I(2) = 67%). Short-term oxygenation measures also favored LRM. We graded the quality of the evidence as low for all key outcomes due to risk of bias and imprecision of the effect estimates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There continues to be insufficient evidence to guide PEEP level selection for preterm infants on CMV for RDS or BPD. Low-quality data suggests that selecting PEEP levels through the application of an oxygenation-guided LRM may result in clinical benefit. Well-conducted randomized trials, particularly to further evaluate the potential benefits of oxygenation-guided LRMs, are needed.",Positive end-expiratory pressure for preterm infants requiring conventional mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome or bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

"Self-assembling dendrimers have facilitated the discovery of periodic and quasiperiodic arrays of supramolecular architectures and the diverse functions derived from them. Examples are liquid quasicrystals and their approximants plus helical columns and spheres, including some that disregard chirality. The same periodic and quasiperiodic arrays were subsequently found in block copolymers, surfactants, lipids, glycolipids, and other complex molecules. Here we report the discovery of lamellar and hexagonal periodic arrays on the surface of vesicles generated from sequence-defined bicomponent monodisperse oligomers containing lipid and glycolipid mimics. These vesicles, known as glycodendrimersomes, act as cell-membrane mimics with hierarchical morphologies resembling bicomponent rafts. These nanosegregated morphologies diminish sugar-sugar interactions enabling stronger binding to sugar-binding proteins than densely packed arrangements of sugars. Importantly, this provides a mechanism to encode the reactivity of sugars via their interaction with sugar-binding proteins. The observed sugar phase-separated hierarchical arrays with lamellar and hexagonal morphologies that encode biological recognition are among the most complex architectures yet discovered in soft matter. The enhanced reactivity of the sugar displays likely has applications in material science and nanomedicine, with potential to evolve into related technologies.",Encoding biological recognition in a bicomponent cell-membrane mimic.
"Efficient delivery of gene therapy vectors across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the holy grail of neurological disease therapies. A variant of the neurotropic vector adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9, called AAV-PHP.B, was shown to very efficiently deliver transgenes across the BBB in C57BL/6J mice. Based on our recent observation that this phenotype is mouse strain dependent, we used whole-exome sequencing-based genetics to map this phenotype to a specific haplotype of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus A (Ly6a) (stem cell antigen-1 [Sca-1]), which encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein whose function had been thought to be limited to the biology of hematopoiesis. Additional biochemical and genetic studies definitively linked high BBB transport to the binding of AAV-PHP.B with LY6A (SCA-1). These studies identify, for the first time, a ligand for this GPI-anchored protein and suggest a role for it in BBB transport that could be hijacked by viruses in natural infections or by gene therapy vectors to treat neurological diseases.",The GPI-Linked Protein LY6A Drives AAV-PHP.B Transport across the Blood-Brain Barrier.
"Adoptive T cell therapy is a form of cellular therapy that utilizes human immune cells, often empowered by the expression of recombinant proteins, to attack selected targets present on tumor or infected cells. T cell-based immunotherapy has been progressing over the past several decades, and reached a milestone with the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy for relapsed and refractory leukemia and lymphoma. Although most studies have used viral vectors, a growing number of researchers have come to appreciate in vitro-transcribed (IVT) mRNA for the development, testing, and application of T cell-based immunotherapeutics. IVT mRNA offers inherent safety features, highly efficient recombinant protein translation, and the ability to control pharmacokinetic properties of the therapy. In this review, we discuss the history of IVT mRNA in adoptive T cell therapy, from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and T cell receptor-based therapies to chimeric antigen receptor therapy and gene-editing techniques, as well as prior and ongoing clinical trials.",The Emerging Role of In Vitro-Transcribed mRNA in Adoptive T Cell Immunotherapy.
"Neurons exhibit a limited ability of repair. Given that mechanical forces affect neuronal outgrowth, it is important to investigate whether mechanosensitive ion channels may regulate axon regeneration. Here, we show that DmPiezo, a Ca(2+)-permeable non-selective cation channel, functions as an intrinsic inhibitor for axon regeneration in Drosophila. DmPiezo activation during axon regeneration induces local Ca(2+) transients at the growth cone, leading to activation of nitric oxide synthase and the downstream cGMP kinase Foraging or PKG to restrict axon regrowth. Loss of DmPiezo enhances axon regeneration of sensory neurons in the peripheral and CNS. Conditional knockout of its mammalian homolog Piezo1 in vivo accelerates regeneration, while its pharmacological activation in vitro modestly reduces regeneration, suggesting the role of Piezo in inhibiting regeneration may be evolutionarily conserved. These findings provide a precedent for the involvement of mechanosensitive channels in axon regeneration and add a potential target for modulating nervous system repair.",The Mechanosensitive Ion Channel Piezo Inhibits Axon Regeneration.
"PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who show a complete response (CR) vs non-CR on pretransplantation imaging studies or pathologic evaluation of liver explants after locoregional therapy (LRT) before liver transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients listed for liver transplantation for HCC (March 1998 to December 2010) undergoing LRT with available multiphase MR/CT imaging before transplantation were included. Pathologic response was evaluated based on liver explant pathology. A total of 108 patients (17 women; 16%) met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Radiologic CR was achieved in 65 patients (60%) vs non-CR in 43 (40%), and pathologic CR was achieved in 36 patients (33%) vs non-CR in 72 (67%). Mean 5-year overall survival (OS) from the time of listing and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after liver transplantation were significantly better for patients with pathologic CR vs non-CR on explant pathology (OS, 83.3% vs 65.2% [28% difference; P = .046]; RFS, 80.6% vs 62.5% [29% difference; P = .045]). Mean 5-y OS and RFS were not significantly different between patients with radiologic CR or non-CR on pretransplantation imaging (OS, 75.4% vs 65.1% [P = .12]; RFS, 74% vs 62.8% [P = .17]). CONCLUSIONS: Achievement of a pathologic CR vs non-CR in response to LRT before liver transplantation for HCC is associated with improved OS from time of listing and improved RFS after liver transplantation. However, current imaging paradigms fall short of accurate delineation of response to LRT, resulting in poor correlation of outcomes between pathologic and radiologic CR.",Association of Complete Radiologic and Pathologic Response following Locoregional Therapy before Liver Transplantation with Long-Term Outcomes of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Study.

"Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joint that can produce persistent orofacial pain as well as functional and structural changes to its bone, cartilage, and ligaments. Despite advances in the clinical utility and reliability of the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders, clinical tools inadequately predict which patients will develop chronic TMJ pain and degeneration, limiting clinical management. The challenges of managing and treating TMJ OA are due, in part, to a limited understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the development and maintenance of TMJ pain. OA is initiated by multiple factors, including injury, aging, abnormal joint mechanics, and atypical joint shape, which can produce microtrauma, remodeling of joint tissues, and synovial inflammation. TMJ microtrauma and remodeling can increase expression of cytokines, chemokines, and catabolic factors that damage synovial tissues and can activate free nerve endings in the joint. Although studies have separately investigated inflammation-driven orofacial pain, acute activity of the trigeminal nerve, or TMJ tissue degeneration and/or damage, the temporal mechanistic factors leading to chronic TMJ pain are undefined. Limited understanding of the interaction between degeneration, intra-articular chemical factors, and pain has further restricted the development of targeted, disease-modifying drugs to help patients avoid long-term pain and invasive procedures, like TMJ replacement. A range of animal models captures features of intra-articular inflammation, joint overloading, and tissue damage. Although those models traditionally measure peripheral sensitivity as a surrogate for pain, recent studies recognize the brain's role in integrating, modulating, and interpreting nociceptive inputs in the TMJ, particularly in light of psychosocial influences on TMJ pain. The articular and neural contributors to TMJ pain, imaging modalities with clinical potential to identify TMJ OA early, and future directions for clinical management of TMJ OA are reviewed in the context of evidence in the field.",Experimental Methods to Inform Diagnostic Approaches for Painful TMJ Osteoarthritis.
"OBJECTIVE:: Tourette's syndrome is polygenic and highly heritable. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches are useful for interrogating the genetic architecture and determinants of Tourette's syndrome and other tic disorders. The authors conducted a GWAS meta-analysis and probed aggregated Tourette's syndrome polygenic risk to test whether Tourette's and related tic disorders have an underlying shared genetic etiology and whether Tourette's polygenic risk scores correlate with worst-ever tic severity and may represent a potential predictor of disease severity. METHODS:: GWAS meta-analysis, gene-based association, and genetic enrichment analyses were conducted in 4,819 Tourette's syndrome case subjects and 9,488 control subjects. Replication of top loci was conducted in an independent population-based sample (706 case subjects, 6,068 control subjects). Relationships between Tourette's polygenic risk scores (PRSs), other tic disorders, ascertainment, and tic severity were examined. RESULTS:: GWAS and gene-based analyses identified one genome-wide significant locus within FLT3 on chromosome 13, rs2504235, although this association was not replicated in the population-based sample. Genetic variants spanning evolutionarily conserved regions significantly explained 92.4% of Tourette's syndrome heritability. Tourette's-associated genes were significantly preferentially expressed in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Tourette's PRS significantly predicted both Tourette's syndrome and tic spectrum disorders status in the population-based sample. Tourette's PRS also significantly correlated with worst-ever tic severity and was higher in case subjects with a family history of tics than in simplex case subjects. CONCLUSIONS:: Modulation of gene expression through noncoding variants, particularly within cortico-striatal circuits, is implicated as a fundamental mechanism in Tourette's syndrome pathogenesis. At a genetic level, tic disorders represent a continuous spectrum of disease, supporting the unification of Tourette's syndrome and other tic disorders in future diagnostic schemata. Tourette's PRSs derived from sufficiently large samples may be useful in the future for predicting conversion of transient tics to chronic tic disorders, as well as tic persistence and lifetime tic severity.",Interrogating the Genetic Determinants of Tourette's Syndrome and Other Tic Disorders Through Genome-Wide Association Studies.
"BACKGROUND: The influence of ventricular assist device (VAD) use in the care of children with end-stage heart failure is growing rapidly through increasing numbers, new devices, expanding indications, and improving outcomes. Pedimacs, a NIH-sponsored U.S. database, provides a platform to understand this emerging population. METHODS: Between 9/19/12-12/31/17, 30 hospitals implanted 508 devices in 423 patients under 19 years-of-age. This past year was one of evolution for the Database as its management was transitioned to the Society of Thoracic Surgery, therefore data from institutions not under contract by August 1(st) 2018 was not included in this report. RESULTS: Of the 423 patients, the diagnosis was cardiomyopathy in 261 (62%), myocarditis in 48 (11%), other in 28 (7%) and congenital heart disease in 86 (20%) with 52 of these patients having single ventricle physiology. The two most common support strategies included LVAD-342 (81%) and BiVAD-64 (15%). Positive Outcome (alive on device or bridge to transplantation/recovery) was 80% at 6-months (overall mortality of 20%). The patient cohort for implantable continuous flow (IC) pumps (n=197) [age at implant 13.4+/-3.8yrs., 19% INTERMACS profile-1, 21% intubated at implant and 12% with CHD] was significantly different from the paracorporeal continuous flow (PC) pump cohort (n=79) [age 3.9+/-5.2yrs, 49% INTERMACS profile-1, 86% intubated at implant, and 38% with CHD] and the paracorporeal pulsatile (PP) pump cohort (n=121) [age 3.3+/-3.9yrs, 41% INTERMACS profile-1, 77 % intubated at implant, and 21% with CHD]. Consistent with their cohort composition, device type positive outcomes at 6 months were PC-63%, PP-77% and IC-92%. Using Parametric Hazard Modeling, an early hazard for death was associated with INTERMACS profile-1, BiVAD, percutaneous devices, PC devices, small volume institutions, low age and low weight, while a constant hazard was associated with intubation and liver dysfunction at time of implant. CONCLUSIONS: IC VADs are the most common VAD type placed in children. The positive outcomes for the IC VADs are >90% at 6 months, which may represent our field's maturation in both patient selection and timing of implantation. Currently the PP/PC devices are limited to supporting our most challenging patients, those less than 20kg, and those with CHD. The introduction of new devices and our communities' commitment to shared learning and improvement will lead to more pediatric lives saved by VAD support, and will also focus on improving the quality of life of children supported with VADs.",Third Annual Pediatric Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (Pedimacs) Report: Pre-Implant Characteristics and Outcomes.
"Pathogenic de novo variants in the X-linked gene SLC35A2 encoding the major Golgi-localized UDP-galactose transporter required for proper protein and lipid glycosylation cause a rare type of congenital disorder of glycosylation known as SLC35A2-CDG (formerly CDG-IIm). To date, twenty-nine unique de novo variants from thirty-two unrelated individuals have been described in the literature. The majority of affected individuals are primarily characterized by varying degrees of neurological impairments with or without skeletal abnormalities. Surprisingly, most affected individuals do not show abnormalities in serum transferrin N-glycosylation, a common biomarker for most types of CDG. Here we present data characterizing 30 individuals and add 26 new variants, the single largest study involving SLC35A2-CDG. The great majority of these individuals had normal transferrin glycosylation. In addition, expanding the molecular and clinical spectrum of this rare disorder, we developed a robust and reliable biochemical assay to assess SLC35A2-dependent UDP-galactose transport activity in primary fibroblasts. Finally, we show that transport activity is directly correlated to the ratio of wild-type to mutant alleles in fibroblasts from affected individuals. This article is protected by copyright.

"OBJECTIVE: Sleep disorders are associated with psychological and physical health, although reports in long-term survivors of childhood cancer are limited. We characterized the prevalence and risk factors for behaviors consistent with sleep disorders in survivors and examined longitudinal associations with emotional distress and physical health outcomes. METHODS: Survivors (n = 1933; median [IQR] age = 35 [30, 41]) and siblings (n = 380; age = 33 [27, 40]) from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study completed measures of sleep quality, fatigue, and sleepiness. Emotional distress and physical health outcomes were assessed approximately 5 years before and after the sleep survey. Multivariable logistic or modified Poisson regression models examined associations with cancer diagnosis, treatment exposures, and emotional and physical health outcomes. RESULTS: Survivors were more likely to report poor sleep efficiency (30.8% vs 24.7%; prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.53), daytime sleepiness (18.7% vs 14.2%; PR = 1.31 [1.01-1.71]), and sleep supplement use (13.5% vs 8.3%; PR = 1.56 [1.09-2.22]) than siblings. Survivors who developed emotional distress were more likely to report poor sleep efficiency (PR = 1.70 [1.40-2.07]), restricted sleep time (PR = 1.35 [1.12-1.62]), fatigue (PR = 2.11 [1.92-2.32]), daytime sleepiness (PR = 2.19 [1.71-2.82]), snoring (PR = 1.85 [1.08-3.16]), and more sleep medication (PR = 2.86 [2.00-4.09]) and supplement use (PR = 1.89[1.33-2.69]). Survivors reporting symptoms of insomnia (PR = 1.46 [1.02-2.08]), fatigue (PR = 1.31 [1.01-1.72]), and using sleep medications (PR = 2.16 [1.13-4.12]) were more likely to develop migraines/headaches. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors report more sleep difficulties and efforts to manage sleep than siblings. These sleep behaviors are related to worsening or persistently elevated emotional distress and may result in increased risk for migraines. Behavioral interventions targeting sleep may be important for improving health outcomes.","Sleep, emotional distress, and physical health in survivors of childhood cancer: A report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study."
"Immune responses are both pathogen and cell type-specific. The innate arm of immunity is characterized by rapid intracellular signaling cascades resulting in the production of hundreds of antimicrobial effectors that protect the host organism. Long noncoding RNAs have been shown to operate as potent modulators of both RNA and protein function throughout cell biology. Emerging data suggest that this is also true within innate immunity. LncRNAs have been shown to regulate both innate immune cell identity and the transcription of gene expression programs critical for innate immune responses. Here, we review the diverse roles of lncRNAs within innate defense with a specific emphasis on host-virus interactions.",Long noncoding RNAs and the regulation of innate immunity and host-virus interactions.
"Tobacco-related morbidity and mortality continue to be a significant public health concern. Unfortunately, current FDA-approved smoking cessation pharmacotherapies have limited efficacy and are associated with high rates of relapse. Therefore, a better understanding of the neurobiological and neurophysiological mechanisms that promote smoking relapse is needed to develop novel smoking cessation medications. Here, we review preclinical studies focused on identifying the neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems that mediate nicotine relapse, often modeled in laboratory animals using the reinstatement paradigm, as well as the plasticity-dependent neurophysiological mechanisms that facilitate nicotine reinstatement. Particular emphasis is placed on how these neuroadaptations relate to smoking relapse in humans. We also highlight a number of important gaps in our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying nicotine reinstatement and critical future directions, which may lead toward the development of novel, target pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation.",Neurobiological and Neurophysiological Mechanisms Underlying Nicotine Seeking and Smoking Relapse.
"In 2012, a new influenza vaccine - FLU4 was first licensed in the US. FLU4 is a quadrivalent flu vaccine, which can protect against four flu viruses. Compared to FLU and FLU3, FLU4 gives broader protection against the flu viruses. To our knowledge, few studies have focused on the FLU4 vaccine and its adverse events. Since safety signal detection is important in vaccination, it is necessary to launch such studies on FLU4. In this paper, we used the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is a national post-marketing vaccine safety surveillance program to identify rare adverse events with year-varying reporting rates for FLU4. The differences in the reporting rates over years are potential signals of vaccine safety issues caused by updates of FLU4 ingredients. We used a likelihood ratio test to simultaneously test the sparsity of events and the differences of event rates over years. We identified 4 adverse events that are rare and have significantly different reporting rates over years.",Identification of Rare Adverse Events with Year-varying Reporting Rates for FLU4 Vaccine in VAERS.
"Older adults are the largest consumers of healthcare. As part of a broader study of personal health information management (PHIM), we interviewed older adults in King County, Washington, and their involved family and friends (FF), regarding health information (HI) sources they seek and utilize. Analysis of interview transcripts revealed four main themes: 1) older adults and FF consider healthcare providers the foundational source of HI; 2) older adults utilize FF for seeking, sharing, and interpreting HI, while FF serve as surrogate seekers and experience-based experts; 3) online searching is common for older adults and FF, but confidence in assessing the quality of online HI is often lacking; 4) a smorgasbord approach is frequently utilized by older adults and FF for gathering and clarifying HI. Design considerations include: facilitating access to quality provider-vetted HI, incorporating older adults and FF in the design process, and creating shared spaces for communication of HI among older adults, FF, and providers.",A Closer Look at Health Information Seeking by Older Adults and Involved Family and Friends: Design Considerations for Health Information Technologies.

"Growing evidence implicates alpha-synuclein aggregation as a key driver of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Herein, the molecular and structural mechanisms of inhibiting alpha-synuclein aggregation by novel analogs of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a phenolic dibenzenediol lignan, were explored using an array of biochemical and biophysical methodologies. NDGA analogs induced modest, progressive compaction of monomeric alpha-synuclein, preventing aggregation into amyloid-like fibrils. This conformational remodeling preserved the dynamic adoption of alpha-helical conformations, which are essential for physiological membrane interactions. Oxidation-dependent NDGA cyclization was required for the interaction with monomeric alpha-synuclein. NDGA analog-pretreated alpha-synuclein did not aggregate even without NDGA-analogs in the aggregation mixture. Strikingly, NDGA-pretreated alpha-synuclein suppressed aggregation of naive untreated aggregation-competent monomeric alpha-synuclein. Further, cyclized NDGA reduced alpha-synuclein-driven neurodegeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans. The cyclized NDGA analogs may serve as a platform for the development of small molecules that stabilize aggregation-resistant alpha-synuclein monomers without interfering with functional conformations yielding potential therapies for PD and related disorders.",Cyclized NDGA modifies dynamic alpha-synuclein monomers preventing aggregation and toxicity.

"More than 14,000 neonates are infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) annually. Approximately half display manifestations limited to the skin, eyes, or mouth (SEM disease). The rest develop invasive infections that spread to the central nervous system (CNS disease or encephalitis) or throughout the infected neonate (disseminated disease). Invasive HSV disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but the viral and host factors that predispose neonates to these forms are unknown. To define viral diversity within the infected neonatal population, we evaluated 10 HSV-2 isolates from newborns with a range of clinical presentations. To assess viral fitness independently of host immune factors, we measured viral growth characteristics in cultured cells and found diverse in vitro phenotypes. Isolates from neonates with CNS disease were associated with larger plaque size and enhanced spread, with the isolates from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exhibiting the most robust growth. We sequenced complete viral genomes of all 10 neonatal viruses, providing new insights into HSV-2 genomic diversity in this clinical setting. We found extensive interhost and intrahost genomic diversity throughout the viral genome, including amino acid differences in more than 90% of the viral proteome. The genes encoding glycoprotein G (gG; US4), glycoprotein I (gI; US7), and glycoprotein K (gK; UL53) and viral proteins UL8, UL20, UL24, and US2 contained variants that were found in association with CNS isolates. Many of these viral proteins are known to contribute to cell spread and neurovirulence in mouse models of CNS disease. This report represents the first application of comparative pathogen genomics to neonatal HSV disease.IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes invasive disease in half of infected neonates, resulting in significant mortality and permanent cognitive morbidity. The factors that contribute to invasive disease are not understood. This study revealed diversity among HSV isolates from infected neonates and detected the first associations between viral genetic variations and clinical disease manifestations. We found that viruses isolated from newborns with encephalitis showed enhanced spread in culture. These viruses contained protein-coding variations not found in viruses causing noninvasive disease. Many of these variations were found in proteins known to impact neurovirulence and viral spread between cells. This work advances our understanding of HSV diversity in the neonatal population and how it may impact disease outcome.",Genotypic and Phenotypic Diversity of Herpes Simplex Virus 2 within the Infected Neonatal Population.
"Drugs that reverse epigenetic silencing, such as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) 5-azacytidine (AZA), have profound effects on transcription and tumor cell survival. AZA is an approved drug for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, and is under investigation for different solid malignant tumors. AZA treatment generates self, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), transcribed from hypomethylated repetitive elements. Self dsRNA accumulation in DNMTi-treated cells leads to type I IFN production and IFN-stimulated gene expression. Here we report that cell death in response to AZA treatment occurs through the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway. OASs are IFN-induced enzymes that synthesize the RNase L activator 2-5A in response to dsRNA. Cells deficient in RNase L or OAS1 to 3 are highly resistant to AZA, as are wild-type cells treated with a small-molecule inhibitor of RNase L. A small-molecule inhibitor of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) also antagonizes RNase L-dependent cell death in response to AZA, consistent with a role for JNK in RNase L-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the rates of AZA-induced and RNase L-dependent cell death were increased by transfection of 2-5A, by deficiencies in ADAR1 (which edits and destabilizes dsRNA), PDE12 or AKAP7 (which degrade 2-5A), or by ionizing radiation (which induces IFN-dependent signaling). Finally, OAS1 expression correlates with AZA sensitivity in the NCI-60 set of tumor cell lines, suggesting that the level of OAS1 can be a biomarker for predicting AZA sensitivity of tumor cells. These studies may eventually lead to pharmacologic strategies for regulating the antitumor activity and toxicity of AZA and related drugs.",OAS-RNase L innate immune pathway mediates the cytotoxicity of a DNA-demethylating drug.
"OBJECTIVES: Youth and young adults with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) are vulnerable to executive dysfunction; however, some patients do not demonstrate functional deficits despite showing abnormalities on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cognitively intact adults with MS have shown enhanced activation patterns relative to healthy controls on working memory tasks. We aim to evaluate whether cognitively preserved pediatric-onset MS patients engage compensatory recruitment strategies to facilitate age-normative performance on a task of working memory. METHODS: Twenty cognitively preserved patients (mean age=18.7+/-2.7 years; 15 female) and 20 age- and sex-matched controls (mean age=18.5+/-2.9 years; 15 female) underwent neuropsychological testing and 3.0 Tesla MRI, including structural and functional acquisitions. Patterns of activation during the Alphaspan task, a working memory paradigm with two levels of executive control demand, were examined via whole-brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses. RESULTS: Across all participants, lower accuracy and greater activation of regions implicated in working memory were observed during the high demand condition. MS patients demonstrated 0.21 s longer response time than controls. ROI analyses revealed enhanced activation for pediatric-onset MS patients relative to controls in the right middle frontal, left paracingulate, right supramarginal, and left superior parietal gyri during the low executive demand condition, over and above differences in response time. MS patients also demonstrated heightened activation in the right supramarginal gyrus in the high executive demand condition. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that pediatric-onset MS patients may engage compensatory recruitment strategies during working memory processing.

"BACKGROUND: While intercenter variation (ICV) in anti-epileptic drug (AED) use in neonates with seizures has been previously reported, variation in AED practices across regional NICUs has not been specifically and systematically evaluated. This is important as these centers typically have multidisciplinary neonatal neurocritical care teams and protocolized approaches to treating conditions such as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a population at high risk for neonatal seizures. To identify opportunities for quality improvement (QI), we evaluated ICV in AED utilization for neonates with HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) across regional NICUs in the US. METHODS: Children's Hospital Neonatal Database and Pediatric Health Information Systems data were linked for 1658 neonates >/=36 weeks' gestation, > 1800 g birthweight, with HIE treated with TH, from 20 NICUs, between 2010 and 2016. ICV in AED use was evaluated using a mixed-effect regression model. Rates of AED exposure, duration, prescription at discharge and standardized AED costs per patient were calculated as different measures of utilization. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent (range: 83-100%) of patients with electrographic seizures, and 26% (0-81%) without electrographic seizures, received AEDs. Phenobarbital was most frequently used (97.6%), followed by levetiracetam (16.9%), phenytoin/fosphenytoin (15.6%) and others (2.4%; oxcarbazepine, topiramate and valproate). There was significant ICV in all measures of AED utilization. Median cost of AEDs per patient was $89.90 (IQR $24.52,$258.58). CONCLUSIONS: Amongst Children's Hospitals, there is marked ICV in AED utilization for neonatal HIE. Variation was particularly notable for HIE patients without electrographic seizures, indicating that this population may be an appropriate target for QI processes to harmonize neuromonitoring and AED practices across centers.",Practice variation in anti-epileptic drug use for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy among regional NICUs.
"Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death among women in low- and middle-income countries, and women living with HIV are at high risk for cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and correlates of cervical cancer and pre-cancer lesions and to examine cervical cancer knowledge among women living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy in rural Andhra Pradesh, India. We conducted cytology-based screening and administered a standardized questionnaire among 598 HIV-infected women. We found 5 (0.8%), 39 (6.5%), 29 (4.9%), and 4 (0.7%) had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and squamous cervical carcinoma (SCC), respectively. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, ASCUS/LSIL was independently associated with age >16 years old at first sexual encounter and smokeless tobacco use. We found no factors associated with HSIL/SCC. In total, 101 women (16.9%) had heard of cervical cancer and 28 (27.7%) of them correctly identified HIV infection as a risk factor. In light of the high prevalence of pre-cancer lesions and low level of cervical cancer knowledge in our study population, focused interventions are needed to improve cervical cancer literacy and prevention among rural women living with HIV.","Cervical cancer awareness and presence of abnormal cytology among HIV-infected women on antiretroviral therapy in rural Andhra Pradesh, India."

"BACKGROUND: Infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow (PBF) often undergo a palliative procedure to provide a stable source of PBF prior to definitive palliation or repair. In the current era, a surgical shunt or ductal stent is used to provide PBF. We aimed to review the current literature comparing ductal stents to surgical shunts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four small, single-center studies and two larger multicenter studies were identified comparing ductal stent to surgical shunt. Combined, these studies showed ductal stent resulted in similar or improved pulmonary artery growth, fewer complications, shorter length of stay, less diuretic use, and improved survival compared to surgical shunt. Despite inherent minor variability among the studies, ductal stent appears to be associated with more frequent reinterventions. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical shunts remain essential to the care of these patients, but ductal stent is a reasonable alternative, and may provide some advantages in select patients with ductal-dependent PBF.",Blalock-Taussig shunt versus patent ductus arteriosus stent as first palliation for ductal-dependent pulmonary circulation lesions: A review of the literature.
"BACKGROUND: Clinical deterioration is difficult to detect in hospitalized children. The pediatric Rothman Index (pRI) is an early warning score that incorporates vital signs, laboratory studies, and nursing assessments to generate deterioration alerts. OBJECTIVES: (1) Evaluate the timing of pRI alerts and clinicians recognizing deterioration or escalating care prior to critical deterioration events (CDEs) and (2) determine whether the parameters triggering alerts were clinically related to deterioration. DESIGN: CDEs are unplanned transfers to the intensive care unit with noninvasive ventilation, tracheal intubation, and/or vasopressor infusion in the 12 hours after transfer. Using one year of data from a large freestanding children's hospital without the pRI, we analyzed CDEs that would have been preceded by pRI alerts. We (1) compared the timing of pRI alerts to time-stamped notes describing changes in patient status and orders reflecting escalations of care and (2) identified score component(s) that caused alerts to trigger and determined whether these were clinically related to CDE etiology. RESULTS: Fifty CDEs would have triggered pRI alertsif the pRI had been in use (sensitivity 68%). In 90% of CDEs, the first clinician note reflecting change in patient status and/or the first order reflecting escalation of care preceded the first pRI alert. All of the vital sign and laboratory components of the pRI and 51% of the nursing components were clinically related to the etiology of the CDE. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence that clinicians were awareof deterioration preceded pRI alerts in most CDEs that generated alerts in the preceding 24 hours.","Beyond Reporting Early Warning Score Sensitivity: The Temporal Relationship and Clinical Relevance of ""True Positive"" Alerts that Precede Critical Deterioration."
"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the associations between low birth weight (LBW) versus high birth weight (HBW) and dysglycemia, including insulin resistance (IR) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in children, and aimed to explore the role of adipose tissue in these relationships. METHODS: A total of 2,935 subjects aged 6 to 18 years were recruited to examine the relationship between birth weight and IR (defined as homeostasis model assessment of IR > 2.3) and IFG. Mediation analyses were conducted to examine the roles of various adipokines and anthropometrics in these relationships. RESULTS: Children with LBW had a nearly twofold increased risk of IR and IFG compared with children with normal birth weight, even after adjusting for BMI. Decreased circulating adiponectin levels contributed to 21.2% of the LBW-IR relationship, whereas none of the selected adipose markers mediated the LBW-IFG relationship. In contrast, after controlling for current BMI or waist circumference, HBW reduced the risk of IR by 34%, but it was not associated with IFG. The HBW-IR relationship was significantly mediated by reduced leptin levels (21.4%) and fat mass percentage (8.8%), after controlling for BMI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the potential role of adipose tissue dysfunction as an underlying mechanism for the birth weight-type 2 diabetes relationship.",Adipose Tissue Mediates Associations of Birth Weight with Glucose Metabolism Disorders in Children.

"BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness are non-traditional risk factors of chronic kidney disease (CKD) related cardiovascular disease (CVD) that could be targeted with exercise. This study investigated the effect of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise on vascular function in non-dialysis CKD. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled trial 36 non-dialysis CKD patients (Mean+/-SEM; Age, 58+/-2years; eGFR, 44+/-2ml/min/1.73m(2)) were allocated to an Exercise Training (EXT) or Control (CON) arm. EXT consisted of 3x45min of supervised exercise per week at 60-85% HRR for 12 weeks whereas CON received routine care. Outcomes were assessed at 0 and 12 weeks. The primary outcome, microvascular function, was assessed via cutaneous vasodilation during local heating measured by laser Doppler flowmetry coupled with microdialysis. Participants were instrumented with 2 microdialysis fibers for delivery of 1)Ringers' solution; 2)superoxide scavenger, Tempol. Conduit artery function was assessed via brachial artery flow mediated dilation. Aortic pressure waveforms and pulse wave velocity were acquired with tonometry and oscillometry. RESULTS: Microvascular function improved following EXT (Week 0 vs. 12; EXT:87+/-2 vs.91+/-2%; CON:86+/-2% vs.84+/-3%; p=0.03). At baseline, pharmacological delivery of Tempol improved microvascular function (Ringer's vs. Tempol: 86+/-1% vs.90+/-1%, p=0.02) but was no longer effective following EXT (91+/-2 vs.87+/-1%, p=0.2), suggesting that an improved redox balance plays a role in EXT related improvements. Brachial artery FMD was maintained following EXT (EXT: 2.6+/-0.4% vs3.8+/-0.8%; CON: 3.5+/-0.6% vs.2.3+/-0.4; p=0.02). Central arterial hemodynamics and arterial stiffness were unchanged following EXT. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise improved microvascular function and maintained conduit artery function and should be considered as an adjunct therapy to reduce CVD risk in CKD.",The Effects of Aerobic Exercise on Vascular Function in Non-Dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
"Mobile applications (apps) have been increasingly utilized to access the latest and abundant information related to genetics/genomics for resources, risk assessments, and individualized recommendations. Nevertheless, the number and quality of the current apps in genetics/genomics remain unknown. Thus, in this review, we aimed to identify existing genetic/genomic apps, summarize their characteristics, and examine their quality. A systematic search of genetics/genomics apps was conducted on Apple Store and Google Play. We adapted a validated evaluation scale, Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS), to examine the quality of genetics/genomics apps. Eighty-eight genetics/genomics apps, with the cost ranging from free to $49.99, formed the final sample. Findings showed that the majority of the apps had reference/resource as a feature (95.5%), had health professional students as the target audience (86.4%), and did not focus on specific diseases (78.5%). Only 21.6% of the apps were developed by reliable or authoritative agencies, and the apps' overall quality was slightly above average based on the criteria of the MARS. Therefore, while genetics/genomics mobile apps might be useful resources, their quality still needs improvement, especially with respect to the credibility and evidence-based items of app information as well as the customization items of app engagement; caution must be taken when using those apps.",Characteristics and quality of genetics and genomics mobile apps: a systematic review.
"PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between lung radiation dose and survival outcomes in children undergoing total body irradiation (TBI)-based hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TBI (1200 or 1320 cGy given twice daily in 6 or 8 fractions) was used as part of 3 HSCT preparative regimens; allowing institutional flexibility regarding TBI techniques, including lung shielding. Lung doses as reported by each participating institution were calculated for different patient setups, with and without shielding, with a variety of dose calculation techniques. The association between lung dose and transplant-related mortality (TRM), relapse-free (RFS) and overall-survival (OS) was examined using Cox proportional hazard regression model controlling for the following variables: TBI dose rate, TBI fields, patient position during TBI, donor type, and pre-HSCT minimal residual disease (MRD) level. RESULTS: From a total of 143 eligible patients127 had lung doses available for this analysis. The TBI techniques were heterogeneous. The mean lung dose was reported as 904.5cGy (SD +/-232.3). Patients treated with lateral fields were more likely to receive lung doses >/=800cGy (p<0.001). Lung dose >/=800cGy influence on TRM was not significant (HR 1.78; p=0.21). On univariate analysis, lung dose >/=800cGy was associated with inferior RFS (HR 1.76; p=0.04) and OS (HR 1.85; p=0.03); in the multivariate analysis, OS maintained statistical significance (HR 1.85; p=0.04). CONCLUSION: The variability in TBI techniques result in an uncertainty with reported lung doses. Lateral fields were associated with higher lung dose, hence better be avoided. Patients treated with lung dose <800 cGy in this study had better outcome. This approach is currently been investigated in COG AALL1331 study.

"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess willingness of women with pelvic floor disorders to adopt nontraditional mobile communication methods with health care providers. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of women with pelvic floor disorders. Women completed a survey regarding what technology they owned, how they utilized it, and their willingness to use technology to communicate with providers. RESULTS: Overall mobile technology ownership was high; however, older women were significantly less likely to own a smartphone (75%) compared with younger (100%) and middle-aged women (98%; P < 0.01). On univariable analysis, factors significantly associated with willingness to use mobile technology were age (P < 0.01) and education status (P < 0.01). A relationship between travel distance to the clinic and willingness to adopt various mobile technologies was not noted. On multivariable analysis, after controlling for education and travel distance to clinic, older women remained significantly less likely to express willingness to use various technologies: video-conference technology (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-0.99), text messaging (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.97), Internet-based patient portal (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98), and e-mail (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98). However, almost 50% of older women and greater than 65% of middle-aged women expressed willingness to adopt technologies for health care communication. CONCLUSIONS: Age-related differences exist in the ownership, utilization, and willingness to communicate with medical providers through mobile technology. However, the majority of women across all age-groups, irrespective of travel distance, are willing to adopt alternative mobile technologies to communicate with their health care providers.",Willingness of Women With Pelvic Floor Disorders to Use Mobile Technology to Communicate With Their Health Care Providers.

"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of different reader and patient parameters on the degree of agreement and the rate of misclassification of vesicoureteric reflux grading on last-image-hold frames in relation to spot-exposed frames from voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) as well as to determine the nature of reflux misclassification on last-image-hold frames. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blinded readers conducted a retrospective evaluation of last-image-hold and spot-exposed frames of the renal fossae from 191 sequential VCUG examinations performed during a five-year period. Kappa tests were used to determine the agreement between reflux gradings and to assess the impact of reader and patient parameters. Pearson product-moment correlations were used to evaluate the effect of patient parameters on reader level of certainty regarding reflux grading. RESULTS: We measured almost perfect overall agreement for more experienced readers and substantial overall agreement for less experienced readers. Point estimates of overall misclassification were less than 2% for more experienced readers and less than 4% for less experienced readers. The readers' level of certainty about reflux grading had a positive impact on agreement values and misclassification rates. Experienced readers' most common misclassification was assigning reflux a grade of 3 on a spot-exposed frame and a grade of 2 on an equivalent last-image-hold frame. Inexperienced readers' most common misclassification involved missing reflux altogether. CONCLUSION: Instances of grade 2 reflux on last-image-hold frames may warrant supplemental evaluation with spot-exposed frames. Otherwise, a reader's level of certainty regarding reflux grading on a last-image-hold frame may help determine whether a supplemental spot-exposed frame would be beneficial.",Effect of Reader and Patient Parameters on the Performance of Last-Image-Hold for Fluoroscopic Grading of Vesicoureteric Reflux.
"A tree-like hierarchical branching structure is present in many biological systems, such as the kidney, lung, mammary gland, and blood vessels. Most of these organs form through branching morphogenesis, where outward growth results in smaller and smaller branches. However, the blood vasculature is unique in that it exists as two trees (arterial and venous) connected at their tips. Obtaining this organization might therefore require unique developmental mechanisms. As reviewed here, recent data indicate that arterial trees often form in reverse order. Accordingly, initial arterial endothelial cell differentiation occurs outside of arterial vessels. These pre-artery cells then build trees by following a migratory path from smaller into larger arteries, a process guided by the forces imparted by blood flow. Thus, in comparison to other branched organs, arteries can obtain their structure through inward growth and coalescence. Here, new information on the underlying mechanisms is discussed, and how defects can lead to pathologies, such as hypoplastic arteries and arteriovenous malformations.",Veins and Arteries Build Hierarchical Branching Patterns Differently: Bottom-Up versus Top-Down.

"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, T cells that have been genetically engineered to express a receptor that recognizes a specific antigen, have given rise to breakthroughs in treating hematological malignancies. However, their success in treating solid tumors has been limited. The unique challenges posed to CAR T cell therapy by solid tumors can be described in three steps: finding, entering, and surviving in the tumor. The use of dual CAR designs that recognize multiple antigens at once and local administration of CAR T cells are both strategies that have been used to overcome the hurdle of localization to the tumor. Additionally, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment has implications for T cell function in terms of differentiation and exhaustion, and combining CARs with checkpoint blockade or depletion of other suppressive factors in the microenvironment has shown very promising results to mitigate the phenomenon of T cell exhaustion. Finally, identifying and overcoming mechanisms associated with dysfunction in CAR T cells is of vital importance to generating CAR T cells that can proliferate and successfully eliminate tumor cells. The structure and costimulatory domains chosen for the CAR may play an important role in the overall function of CAR T cells in the TME, and ""armored"" CARs that secrete cytokines and third- and fourth-generation CARs with multiple costimulatory domains offer ways to enhance CAR T cell function.","CAR T Cells for Solid Tumors: New Strategies for Finding, Infiltrating, and Surviving in the Tumor Microenvironment."
"Rewired metabolism of glutamine in cancer has been well documented, but less is known about other amino acids such as histidine. Here, we use Drosophila cancer models to show that decreasing the concentration of histidine in the diet strongly inhibits the growth of mutant clones induced by loss of Nerfin-1 or gain of Notch activity. In contrast, changes in dietary histidine have much less effect on the growth of wildtype neural stem cells and Prospero neural tumours. The reliance of tumours on dietary histidine and also on histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) depends upon their growth requirement for Myc. We demonstrate that Myc overexpression in nerfin-1 tumours is sufficient to switch their mode of growth from histidine/Hdc sensitive to resistant. This study suggests that perturbations in histidine metabolism selectively target neural tumours that grow via a dedifferentiation process involving large cell size increases driven by Myc.",Histidine is selectively required for the growth of Myc-dependent dedifferentiation tumours in the Drosophila CNS.
"PURPOSE: We sought to assess clinical outcomes and toxicities of patients enrolled on two prospective registry trials with recurrent lung cancer reirradiated with PBT. MATERIALS/METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients were reirradiated with PBT at 8 institutions. Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy was used to treat the previous lung cancer in 68% of patients (median equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) 60.2 Gy) or hypofractionated/stereotactic body radiation therapy in 32% (median EQD2 83.3 Gy). Nine (11%) patients received >/=2 courses of thoracic irradiation prior to PBT. ECOG performance status was 2-3 in 13%. Median time from prior radiotherapy to PBT was 19.9 months. PBT was delivered with conventional fractionation in 58% (median EQD2 60 Gy), hyperfractionation in 3% (median EQD2 62.7 Gy) or hypofractionation in 39% (median EQD2 60.4 Gy). Twenty-four (30%) patients received chemotherapy concurrently with PBT. RESULTS: All patients completed PBT as planned. At a median follow-up of 10.7 months after PBT, median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 15.2 months and 10.5 months, respectively. Acute and late grade 3 toxicities occurred in 6% and 1%, respectively. Three patients died after PBT from possible radiation toxicity. On multivariate analysis, ECOG performance status of </=1 was associated with OS (HR 0.35 [0.15-0.80], p=0.014) and PFS (HR 0.32 [0.14-0.73], p=0.007). CONCLUSION: This is the largest series to date of PBT reirradiation for recurrent lung cancer, showing that reirradiation with PBT is well tolerated with acceptable toxicity and encouraging efficacy.

"BACKGROUND: Regenerative medicine using stem cell technology is an emerging field that is currently tested for inborn and acquired liver diseases. AIM: This phase I/II prospective, open label, multicenter, randomized trial aimed primarily at evaluating the safety of Heterologous Human Adult Liver-derived Progenitor Cells (HepaStem) in pediatric patients with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) or Crigler-Najjar (CN) syndrome 6 months post-transplantation. The secondary objective included the assessment of safety up to 12 months post-infusion, and of preliminary efficacy. METHODS: Fourteen patients with UCDs and 6 with CN syndrome were divided into 3 cohorts by body weight and intraportally infused with three doses of HepaStem. Clinical status, portal-vein hemodynamics, morphology of the liver, de novo detection of circulating anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies, and clinically significant adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) to infusion were evaluated by using an intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: The overall safety of HepaStem was confirmed. For the entire study period, patient-month incidence rate was 1.76 for the AEs and 0.21 for the SAEs, of which 38% occurred within one month post-infusion. There was a trend of higher events in UCD as compared to CN patients. Segmental left portal vein thrombosis occurred in one patient and intraluminal local transient thrombus in a second patient. The other AEs were in line with expectations for catheter placement, cell infusion, concomitant medications, age and underlying diseases.

In contrast to the host's genome, the microbiome is amenable to change over the course of an organism's lifetime, providing an opportunity to therapeutically modulate the microbiome's impact on human pathophysiology. In this Perspective, we highlight environmental factors that regulate the temporal dynamics of the intestinal microbiome, with a particular focus on the different time scales at which they act. We propose that the identification of transient and intermediate states of microbiome responses to perturbations is essential for understanding the rules that govern the behavior of this ecosystem. The delineation of microbiome dynamics is also helpful for distinguishing cause and effect in microbiome responses to environmental stimuli. Understanding the dimension of time in host-microbiome interactions is therefore critical for therapeutic strategies that aim at short-term or long-term engineering of the intestinal microbial community.",The Dimension of Time in Host-Microbiome Interactions.
"Introduction: Inpatient telemetry monitoring is a commonly used technology designed to detect and monitor life-threatening arrhythmias. However, residents are rarely educated in the proper use and interpretation of telemetry monitoring. Methods: We developed a training module containing an educational video, PowerPoint presentation, and hands-on interactive learning session with a telemetry expert. The module highlights proper use of telemetry monitoring, recognition of telemetry artifact, and interrogation of telemetry to identify clinically significant arrhythmias. Learners completed pre- and postcurriculum knowledge-based assessments and a postcurriculum survey on their experience with the module. In total, the educational curriculum had three 60-minute sessions. Results: Thirty-two residents participated in the training module. Residents scored higher on the posttest (77% +/- 12%) than on the pretest (70% +/- 12%), t(31) = -4.3, p < .001. Wilcoxon signed rank tests indicated PGY-3s performed better on the posttest (Mdn = 0.86) than on the pretest (Mdn = 0.72), z = -2.19, p = .031. PGY-2s also performed better on the posttest (Mdn = 0.86) than on the pretest (Mdn = 0.76), z = -2.04, p = .042. There was no difference between pretest (Mdn = 0.66) and posttest (Mdn = 0.71) scores for PGY-1s, z = -1.50, p = .142. The majority of residents reported that the telemetry curriculum boosted their self-confidence, helped prepare them to analyze telemetry on their patients, and should be a required component of the residency. Discussion: This module represents a new paradigm for teaching residents how to successfully and confidently interpret and use inpatient telemetry.",Interactive Multimodal Curriculum on Use and Interpretation of Inpatient Telemetry.
"Introduction: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is becoming more common with an aging population. Lower GI bleeding is less common than its upper GI bleed counterpart. Incidence of bleeding is increasing because more patients are on anticoagulation medication. Abnormal coagulation can lead to this life-threatening condition requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment by a skilled medical provider. Simulation can be used to practice recognition of this disease process and work through treatment algorithms. Methods: This simulation case used a high-fidelity simulator to teach emergency medicine providers how to manage lower GI bleeding in a patient with abnormal coagulation secondary to intentional ingestion of rodenticide. The case simulated a 58-year-old female with history of bipolar disorder presenting with brisk rectal bleeding. Residents were expected to identify the type of GI bleed, leading to recognition that the patient was in hemorrhagic shock; they then had to appropriately reverse the anticoagulation and resuscitate with blood products. Afterward, learners were given a short survey to evaluate the case and debriefing process. Results: The case was performed at the University of Pennsylvania Simulation Center as part of the Emergency Medicine Resident Simulation Curriculum. Twenty-eight learners took part; of these, 20 (71%) found the simulation realistic, and 24 (86%) agreed or strongly agreed that the simulation was useful. Discussion: Main learning points include management of lower GI bleeding and reversal of abnormal anticoagulation. This simulation case is straightforward to run, requires minimal resources, and has been well received by learners at our institution.",Rodenticide Causing Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Resident Simulation.
"Introduction: Cardiopulmonary compromises are infrequent but high-acuity events that occur at pediatric hospitals. Simulation is a powerful modality to teach fellows in pediatric critical care, cardiology, and neonatology important clinical skills in managing complex cardiorespiratory pathophysiology in infants with cyanotic heart disease. Methods: We developed three simulation cases of hypoxemia involving differing complex cardiorespiratory pathophysiology in neonates/infants with cyanotic heart disease. Through teamwork, the participants were expected to recognize hypoxemia, work through a differential diagnosis, and implement the medical intervention needed to temporize while awaiting further procedures. Assessment of the participants' performance was via direct observation during the simulated activity. Debriefing occurred immediately using a formal debriefing framework. Results: In 10 years, these three cases have been utilized approximately 48 times. Participants subjectively increased their confidence in managing cardiopulmonary events and improved their teamwork and communication skills in similar high-stress events. Discussion: This unique module advanced learners' knowledge by building on their Pediatric Advanced Life Support and Neonatal Resuscitation Program foundation, identified management deficits in the care of patients with complex cardiorespiratory pathophysiology, and taught effective teamwork with role assignment and closed-loop communication.",Acute Hypoxemia in Infants With Cyanotic Complex Cardiac Anatomy: Simulation Cases for Pediatric Fellows.
"Introduction: In clinical practice, ethical dilemmas are frequently faced by pediatric endocrinologists. This initiative's objectives were to (a) determine if endocrine fellows and faculty perceived that an effective ethics curriculum existed and (b) evaluate whether case-based modules would be an effective tool for ethics education. Methods: Participation was sought from eight large pediatric endocrine programs (home programs and affiliates of the Pediatric Endocrine Society's Ethics Committee members) after the distribution of eight case-based modules (geared mainly to fellows) and pre- and postsurveys. Questions examining self-reported knowledge (K) of the ethical pillars (beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice), attitudes (A) towards these, and the individual's likelihood of utilizing them in clinical practice (P), in addition to the need for/benefit of this curriculum, were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Results: Six out of eight programs participated, with surveys completed by fellows (n = 29), faculty (n = 7), and advanced practitioners (n = 3). Of the respondents, only 20.3% believed an effective ethics curriculum was already in place. After module completion, KAP scores improved, with the greatest improvement seen in knowledge scores. Additionally, 94.9% of respondents strongly agreed (n = 26) or agreed (n = 11) that the curriculum would be a valuable addition to fellowship training. All faculty believed that the curriculum was helpful in imparting ethical principles of clinical practice. Discussion: The findings suggest that this curriculum would be useful in knowledge advancement of ethical principles and could fulfill a long-standing need to provide clinical ethics education for faculty and fellows.",Ethics in Pediatric Endocrinology: Curriculum for Fellows and Faculty.
"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subpopulation of T cells that are specialized in suppressing immune responses. Here we show that the arginine methyl transferase protein PRMT5 can complex with FOXP3 transcription factors in Tregs. Mice with conditional knock out (cKO) of PRMT5 expression in Tregs develop severe scurfy-like autoimmunity. In these PRMT5 cKO mice, the spleen has reduced numbers of Tregs, but normal numbers of Tregs are found in the peripheral lymph nodes. These peripheral Tregs that lack PRMT5, however, display a limited suppressive function. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that FOXP3 can be di-methylated at positions R27, R51, and R146. A point mutation of Arginine (R) 51 to Lysine (K) led to defective suppressive functions in human CD4 T cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 by DS-437 also reduced human Treg functions and inhibited the methylation of FOXP3. In addition, DS-437 significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effects of anti-erbB2/neu monoclonal antibody targeted therapy in Balb/c mice bearing CT26Her2 tumors by inhibiting Treg function and induction of tumor immunity. Controlling PRMT5 activity is a promising strategy for cancer therapy in situations where host immunity against tumors is attenuated in a FOXP3 dependent manner.",PRMT5 Associates With the FOXP3 Homomer and When Disabled Enhances Targeted p185(erbB2/neu) Tumor Immunotherapy.
"Multivariate regression with high-dimensional covariates has many applications in genomic and genetic research, in which some covariates are expected to be associated with multiple responses. This paper considers joint testing for regression coefficients over multiple responses and develops simultaneous testing methods with false discovery rate control. The test statistic is based on inverse regression and bias-corrected group lasso estimates of the regression coefficients and is shown to have an asymptotic chi-squared null distribution. A row-wise multiple testing procedure is developed to identify the covariates associated with the responses. The procedure is shown to control the false discovery proportion and false discovery rate at a prespecified level asymptotically. Simulations demonstrate the gain in power, relative to entrywise testing, in detecting the covariates associated with the responses. The test is applied to an ovarian cancer dataset to identify the microRNA regulators that regulate protein expression.",Joint testing and false discovery rate control in high-dimensional multivariate regression.
"Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection can lead to Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a highly aggressive form of skin cancer. Mechanistic studies to fully investigate MCPyV molecular biology and oncogenic mechanisms have been hampered by a lack of adequate cell culture models. Here, we describe a set of protocols for performing and detecting MCPyV infection of primary human skin cells. The protocols describe the isolation of human dermal fibroblasts, preparation of recombinant MCPyV virions, and detection of virus infection by both immunofluorescent (IF) staining and in situ DNA-hybridization chain reaction (HCR), which is a highly sensitive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approach. The protocols herein can be adapted by interested researchers to identify other cell types or cell lines that support MCPyV infection. The described FISH approach could also be adapted for detecting low levels of viral DNAs present in the infected human skin.",Merkel Cell Polyomavirus Infection and Detection.

"The pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus is thought to depend on the production of pore-forming leukocidins that kill leukocytes and lyse erythrocytes. Two leukocidins, Leukocidin ED (LukED) and gamma-Hemolysin AB (HlgAB), are necessary and sufficient to kill mice upon infection and toxin challenge. We demonstrate that LukED and HlgAB cause vascular congestion and derangements in vascular fluid distribution that rapidly cause death in mice. The Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) on endothelial cells, rather than leukocytes or erythrocytes, is the critical target for lethality. Consistent with this, LukED and HlgAB injure primary human endothelial cells in a DARC-dependent manner, and mice with DARC-deficient endothelial cells are resistant to toxin-mediated lethality. During bloodstream infection in mice, DARC targeting by S. aureus causes increased tissue damage, organ dysfunction, and host death. The potential for S. aureus leukocidins to manipulate vascular integrity highlights the importance of these virulence factors.",Staphylococcus aureus Leukocidins Target Endothelial DARC to Cause Lethality in Mice.
"OBJECTIVE: This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children <15 years of age based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy. PURPOSE: The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine. KEY ACTION STATEMENTS: The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been <7 episodes in the past year, <5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or <3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of >1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are <2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are <3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index >/=10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir <80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and >/=1 of the following: temperature >38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. DIFFERENCES FROM PRIOR GUIDELINE: (1) Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. (2) There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. (3) Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. (4) Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). (5) Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). (6) Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. (7) Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.",Clinical Practice Guideline: Tonsillectomy in Children (Update).
"INTRODUCTION: Clinical indicators are used to measure and quantify the safety and quality of patient care. They are also often used as endpoints in clinical trials. Definitions of clinical indicators in common use are extremely heterogeneous, limiting their applicability. As part of the international Standardised Endpoints in Perioperative Medicine initiative, this study will identify clinical indicators by systematically reviewing the anaesthesia and perioperative medicine literature, and will provide consensus, clinically useful definitions for those indicators using a Delphi process. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An electronic database search will be conducted of Medline (PubMed/OVID), EMBASE and the Cochrane Library in order to meet this review's objectives that are: (1) To identify clinical indicators and their definitions used in randomised controlled trials that assess patient-related quality and safety interventions in perioperative medicine; (2) To select a shortlist of recommended indicators and definitions that are the most suitable for evaluation of quality and safety interventions following an expert-based consensus-gaining process (Delphi method) and (3) To provide a classification scale for each indicator related to its clarity of definition, validity (strength), reliability, feasibility (ease of use) and frequency of use. This systematic review protocol is reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this systematic review and Delphi process. The results of this study will be disseminated to the anaesthesia and perioperative medicine clinical and academic community through national and international presentations and through publication in a peer reviewed journal.

"Genome-wide association and whole exome sequencing studies from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patient populations have implicated numerous risk factor genes whose mutation or deletion results in significantly increased incidence of ASD. Behavioral studies of monogenic mutant mouse models of ASD-associated genes have been useful for identifying aberrant neural circuitry. However, behavioral results often differ from lab to lab, and studies incorporating both males and females are often not performed despite the significant sex-bias of ASD. In this study, we sought to investigate the simple, passive behavior of home-cage activity monitoring across multiple 24-h days in four different monogenic mouse models of ASD: Shank3b(-/-), Cntnap2(-/-), Pcdh10(+/-), and Fmr1 knockout mice. Relative to sex-matched wildtype (WT) littermates, we discovered significant home-cage hypoactivity, particularly in the dark (active) phase of the light/dark cycle, in male mice of all four ASD-associated transgenic models. For Cntnap2(-/-) and Pcdh10(+/-) mice, these activity alterations were sex-specific, as female mice did not exhibit home-cage activity differences relative to sex-matched WT controls. These home-cage hypoactivity alterations differ from activity findings previously reported using short-term activity measurements in a novel open field. Despite circadian problems reported in human ASD patients, none of the mouse models studied had alterations in free-running circadian period. Together, these findings highlight a shared phenotype across several monogenic mouse models of ASD, outline the importance of methodology on behavioral interpretation, and in some genetic lines parallel the male-enhanced phenotypic presentation observed in human ASDs.",Home-cage hypoactivity in mouse genetic models of autism spectrum disorder.
"Cocaine abuse remains a pervasive public health problem, and treatments thus far have proven ineffective for long-term abstinence maintenance. Intensive research on the neurobiology underlying drug abuse has led to the consideration of many candidate transmitter systems to target for intervention. Among these, the hypocretin/orexin (hcrt/ox) neuropeptide system holds largely untapped yet clinically viable therapeutic potential. Hcrt/ox originates from the hypothalamus and projects widely across the mammalian central nervous system to produce neuroexcitatory actions via two excitatory G-protein coupled receptor subtypes. Functionally, hcrt/ox promotes arousal/wakefulness and facilitates energy homeostasis. In the early 2000s, hcrt/ox transmission was shown to underlie mating behavior in male rats suggesting a novel role in reward-seeking. Soon thereafter, hcrt/ox neurons were shown to respond to drug-associated stimuli, and hcrt/ox transmission was found to facilitate motivated responding for intravenous cocaine. Notably, blocking hcrt/ox transmission using systemic or site-directed pharmacological antagonists markedly reduced motivated drug-taking as well as drug-seeking in tests of relapse. This review will unfold the current state of knowledge implicating hcrt/ox receptor transmission in the context of cocaine abuse and provide detailed background on animal models and underlying midbrain circuits. Specifically, attention will be paid to the mesoaccumbens, tegmental, habenular, pallidal and preoptic circuits. The review will conclude with discussion of recent preclinical studies assessing utility of suvorexant - the first and only FDA-approved hcrt/ox receptor antagonist - against cocaine-associated behaviors.",Cocaine abuse and midbrain circuits: Functional anatomy of hypocretin/orexin transmission and therapeutic prospect.
"Background Untreated mental illness among adolescents is a serious public health concern. This study offers a classification tool for mental illness based on severity and identifies a starting point for needed interventions. Methods We assessed the prevalence and severity of serious emotional disturbances (SED)/serious mental illnesses (SMI) among transition-aged adolescents in an urban primary care practice and identified those with unmet needs. Medical records were abstracted for 16-22 year-old patients with at least one International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 diagnosis of serious emotional disturbances (SED)/serious mental illnesses (SMI) seen between May 1, 2014 and July 31, 2015. The primary outcome was whether 16-22 year-old patients with serious emotional disturbances (SED)/serious mental illnesses (SMI) diagnoses were connected to mental health care and associated factors including severity of mental illness, provider referral and psychotropic medication use. Results We identified 546 patients with a mean age of 18.8 years [standard deviation (SD) +/- 1.7]. Ninety percent were African American and 86% were publicly insured. Based on the illness severity criteria, 189 (35%) were categorized as ""mild"", 293 (54%) as ""moderate"" and 64 (12%) as ""severe"". The majority (n = 460, 84.3%) had a mental health referral, but only 219 (40%) were connected to care. Adolescents aged 18-22 had 48% fewer odds to be connected to care compared to those aged 16-17 (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.80; p-value = 0.003). Conclusions There is a gap in mental health services among a sample of minority adolescents in an urban environment with mental health needs. The gap is especially prevalent among older adolescents aging out of the pediatric system. Primary care providers (PCPs) are central to ensuring access to treatment, though they may be unable to meet the needs of patients with severe forms of serious emotional disturbances (SED)/serious mental illnesses (SMI). Our study characterizes the mental health needs of minority adolescents by severity and offers direction for identifying those who would most benefit from additional resources and support.",Characterizing the unmet mental health needs of urban adolescents.
"Influenza is a leading cause of death in the elderly, and the vaccine protects only a fraction of this population. A key aspect of antibody-mediated anti-influenza virus immunity is adaptation to antigenically distinct epitopes on emerging strains. We examined factors contributing to reduced influenza vaccine efficacy in the elderly and uncovered a dramatic reduction in the accumulation of de novo immunoglobulin gene somatic mutations upon vaccination. This reduction is associated with a significant decrease in the capacity of antibodies to target the viral glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), and critical protective epitopes surrounding the HA receptor-binding domain. Immune escape by antigenic drift, in which viruses generate mutations in key antigenic epitopes, becomes highly exaggerated. Because of this reduced adaptability, most B cells activated in the elderly cohort target highly conserved but less potent epitopes. Given these findings, vaccines driving immunoglobulin gene somatic hypermutation should be a priority to protect elderly individuals.",Influenza Virus Vaccination Elicits Poorly Adapted B Cell Responses in Elderly Individuals.
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is highly effective at reducing cancer-related morbidity and mortality, yet screening rates remain suboptimal. Evidence-based interventions can increase screening rates, particularly when they target multiple levels (e.g., patients, providers, health care systems). However, effective interventions remain underutilized. Thus, there is a pressing need to build capacity to select and implement multilevel CRC screening interventions. We report on formative research aimed at understanding how Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) staff select and implement CRC screening interventions, which will inform development of capacity-building strategies. We report the qualitative findings from a study that used a mixed methods design, starting with a quantitative survey followed by a qualitative study. In-depth interviews were conducted with 28 staff from 14 FQHCs in 8 states. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided interview questions and data analysis. Related to the CFIR process domain, few respondents described conducting formal assessments of factors contributing to low screening rates prior to planning their interventions. Many described engaging champions, implementation leaders, and external change agents. Few described a systematic approach to executing implementation plans beyond conducting plan-do-study-act cycles. Reflection and evaluation consisted primarily of reviewing Uniform Data System performance measures. Findings also include themes related to factors influencing these implementation processes. Although FQHCs are implementing CRC screening interventions, they are not actively targeting the multilevel factors influencing their CRC screening rates. Our findings on gaps in FQHCs' implementation processes will inform development of strategies to build capacity to select and implement multilevel CRC screening interventions.",Understanding the processes that Federally Qualified Health Centers use to select and implement colorectal cancer screening interventions: a qualitative study.
"BACKGROUND: Rapid antibiotic administration is known to improve sepsis outcomes, however early diagnosis remains challenging due to complex presentation. Our objective was to develop a model using readily available electronic health record (EHR) data capable of recognizing infant sepsis at least 4 hours prior to clinical recognition. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective case control study of infants hospitalized >/=48 hours in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between September 2014 and November 2017 who received at least one sepsis evaluation before 12 months of age. We considered two evaluation outcomes as cases: culture positive-positive blood culture for a known pathogen (110 evaluations); and clinically positive-negative cultures but antibiotics administered for >/=120 hours (265 evaluations). Case data was taken from the 44-hour window ending 4 hours prior to evaluation. We randomly sampled 1,100 44-hour windows of control data from all times >/=10 days removed from any evaluation. Model inputs consisted of up to 36 features derived from routine EHR data. Using 10-fold nested cross-validation, 8 machine learning models were trained to classify inputs as sepsis positive or negative. When tasked with discriminating culture positive cases from controls, 6 models achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) between 0.80-0.82 with no significant differences between them. Including both culture and clinically positive cases, the same 6 models achieved an AUC between 0.85-0.87, again with no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models can identify infants with sepsis in the NICU hours prior to clinical recognition. Learning curves indicate model improvement may be achieved with additional training examples. Additional input features may also improve performance. Further research is warranted to assess potential performance improvements and clinical efficacy in a prospective trial.",Machine learning models for early sepsis recognition in the neonatal intensive care unit using readily available electronic health record data.
"Importance: There are currently no approved treatments for peanut allergy. Objective: To assess the efficacy and adverse events of epicutaneous immunotherapy with a peanut patch among peanut-allergic children. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 31 sites in 5 countries between January 8, 2016, and August 18, 2017. Participants included peanut-allergic children (aged 4-11 years [n = 356] without a history of a severe anaphylactic reaction) developing objective symptoms during a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge at an eliciting dose of 300 mg or less of peanut protein. Interventions: Daily treatment with peanut patch containing either 250 mug of peanut protein (n = 238) or placebo (n = 118) for 12 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the percentage difference in responders between the peanut patch and placebo patch based on eliciting dose (highest dose at which objective signs/symptoms of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction developed) determined by food challenges at baseline and month 12. Participants with baseline eliciting dose of 10 mg or less were responders if the posttreatment eliciting dose was 300 mg or more; participants with baseline eliciting dose greater than 10 to 300 mg were responders if the posttreatment eliciting dose was 1000 mg or more. A threshold of 15% or more on the lower bound of a 95% CI around responder rate difference was prespecified to determine a positive trial result. Adverse event evaluation included collection of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Results: Among 356 participants randomized (median age, 7 years; 61.2% male), 89.9% completed the trial; the mean treatment adherence was 98.5%. The responder rate was 35.3% with peanut-patch treatment vs 13.6% with placebo (difference, 21.7% [95% CI, 12.4%-29.8%; P < .001]). The prespecified lower bound of the CI threshold was not met. TEAEs, primarily patch application site reactions, occurred in 95.4% and 89% of active and placebo groups, respectively. The all-causes rate of discontinuation was 10.5% in the peanut-patch group vs 9.3% in the placebo group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among peanut-allergic children aged 4 to 11 years, the percentage difference in responders at 12 months with the 250-mug peanut-patch therapy vs placebo was 21.7% and was statistically significant, but did not meet the prespecified lower bound of the confidence interval criterion for a positive trial result. The clinical relevance of not meeting this lower bound of the confidence interval with respect to the treatment of peanut-allergic children with epicutaneous immunotherapy remains to be determined.

"Importance: Early breast development is a risk factor for breast cancer, and girls with a breast cancer family history (BCFH) experience breast development earlier than girls without a BCFH. Objectives: To assess whether prepubertal androgen concentrations are associated with timing of breast development (analysis 1) and to compare serum androgen concentrations in girls with and without a BCFH (analysis 2). Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study of 104 girls aged 6 to 13 years at baseline using data collected between August 16, 2011, and March 24, 2016, from the Lessons in Epidemiology and Genetics of Adult Cancer From Youth (LEGACY) Girls Study, New York site. Exposures: Analysis 1 included serum concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, and testosterone (free and total) measured before breast development and divided at the median into high and low categories. Analysis 2 included the degree of BCFH: first-degree was defined as having a mother with breast cancer and second-degree was defined as having a grandmother or aunt with breast cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Analysis 1 included age at onset of breast development measured using the Pubertal Development Scale (scores range from 1-4; scores >/=2 indicate breast development), and analysis 2 included serum androgen concentrations. We also assessed breast cancer-specific distress using the 8-item Child Impact of Events Scale. Results: Our analyses included 36 girls for the prospective model, 92 girls for the cross-sectional model, and 104 girls for the longitudinal model. Of the 104 girls, the mean (SD) age at baseline was 10.3 (2.5) years, and 41 (39.4%) were non-Hispanic white, 41 (39.4%) were Hispanic, 13 (12.5%) were non-Hispanic black, and 9 (8.7%) were other race/ethnicity. Forty-two girls (40.4%) had a positive BCFH. Girls with prepubertal androstenedione concentrations above the median began breast development 1.5 years earlier than girls with concentrations below the median (Weibull survival model-estimated median age, 9.4 [95% CI, 9.0-9.8] years vs 10.9 [95% CI, 10.4-11.5] years; P = .001). Similar patterns were observed for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (1.1 years earlier: age, 9.6 [95% CI, 9.1-10.1] years vs 10.7 [95% CI, 10.2-11.3] years; P = .009), total testosterone (1.4 years earlier: age, 9.5 [95% CI, 9.1-9.9] years vs 10.9 [95% CI, 10.4-11.5] years; P = .001), and free testosterone (1.1 years earlier: age, 9.7 [95% CI, 9.2-10.1] years vs 10.8 [95% CI, 10.2-11.4] years; P = .01). Compared with girls without BCFH, girls with a first-degree BCFH, but not a second-degree BCFH, had 240% higher androstenedione concentrations (geometric means: no BCFH, 0.49 ng/mL vs first-degree BCFH, 1.8 ng/mL vs second-degree, 1.6 ng/mL; P = .01), 10% higher total testosterone concentrations (12.7 ng/dL vs 14.0 ng/dL vs 13.7 ng/dL; P = .01), and 92% higher free testosterone concentrations (1.3 pg/mL vs 2.5 pg/mL vs 0.3 pg/mL; P = .14). The dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentration did not differ between BCFH-positive and BCFH-negative girls but was elevated in girls with breast cancer-specific distress. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that androgen concentrations may differ between girls with and without a BCFH and that elevated hormone concentrations during adolescence may be another factor to help explain the familial clustering of breast cancer.",Association of Prepubertal and Adolescent Androgen Concentrations With Timing of Breast Development and Family History of Breast Cancer.
"We have established a microbiome signature for prostate cancer using an array-based metagenomic and capture-sequencing approach. A diverse microbiome signature (viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic) was observed in the prostate cancer samples compared with benign prostate hyperplasia controls. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified three distinct prostate cancer-specific microbiome signatures. The three signatures correlated with different grades, stages and scores of the cancer. Thus, microbiome signature analysis potentially provides clinical diagnosis and outcome predictions. The array data were validated by PCR and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Specific NGS data suggested that certain viral genomic sequences were inserted into the host somatic chromosomes of the prostate cancer samples. A randomly selected group of these was validated by direct PCR and sequencing. In addition, PCR validation of Helicobacter showed that Helicobacter cagA sequences integrated within specific chromosomes of prostate tumor cells. The viral and Helicobacter integrations are predicted to affect the expression of several cellular genes associated with oncogenic processes.",Microbiome signatures in prostate cancer.
"PURPOSE: Child eye health is a significant public health issue in low- and middle-income countries, such as Botswana, and the need for eye care requires a well-integrated and innovative approach. Traditional vision screening tools are costly, difficult to transport, and reliant on highly trained eye care professionals. Novel smartphone-based vision screening technologies, however, are low cost, portable, and easily operated by trained novice users. Peek Vision is a mobile health (m-Health) organization that creates smartphone applications that screen for visual acuity, generate referrals to eye care professionals, and send phone notifications to those being screened. METHODOLOGY: In 2016, the government of Botswana partnered with local and international stakeholders to implement Peek vision screening in a subset of schoolchildren. From June to December of 2016, teachers, health assistants, nurses, and other volunteers in 49 schools in the Goodhope Subdistrict utilized Peek applications to screen schoolchildren, using acuity <6/12 in the better eye as a threshold for visual impairment. RESULTS: Among 12,877 children screened, the application identified 16% (2,065/12,877) as screening positive for visual impairment, and these students were referred for optometric care. Ultimately, 96% (1,985/2,065) attended optometry triage camps, during which 42% (835/1,985) were provided with spectacles, 5% (94/1,985) received ophthalmic medications, and 3% (63/1,985) were referred for ophthalmic care. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive vision screening in schoolchildren in Botswana. Furthermore, the successful implementation of Peek smartphone applications illustrates the potential of m-Health technology for enacting comprehensive vision screening programs at a national level in Botswana and other similar countries.",Implementing a School Vision Screening Program in Botswana Using Smartphone Technology.
"BACKGROUND: Describing severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) in dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) is challenging. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Mitral regurgitant fraction (RF), effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA), and the ratio of mitral regurgitant to aortic flow (QMR :QAo ) can be calculated from routine echocardiographic measurements and provide additional information regarding MR severity. ANIMALS: Fifty-seven dogs with preclinical DMVD including 36 without and 21 with cardiomegaly. METHODS: Prospective observational study. The expected relationships among RF, EROA, and QMR :QAo and 1-dimensional measurements including left atrium to aortic root diameter ratio (LA:Ao) and normalized left ventricular internal dimension at end-diastole (LVIDdN) were mathematically derived and calculated using echocardiographic data from the study population. Nonlinear goodness of fit was determined by calculation of the root mean standard error. The correlations between 1-dimensional and multidimensional indices were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The relationships among RF, EROA, QMR :QAo , and both LA:Ao and LVIDdN were curvilinear, and the multidimensional indices differentiated MR of variable severity. By contrast, 1-dimensional measurements were insensitive to MR severity until RF equaled or exceeded 50%. Regurgitant fraction >/=50%, EROA to body surface area >/=0.347 and QMR :QAo >/=0.79 were strongly associated with LA:Ao >/=1.6 and LVIDdN >/=1.7. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Regurgitant fraction, EROA, and QMR :QAo quantify MR severity in dogs with preclinical DMVD in a manner that 1-dimensional measurements do not.",Echocardiographic indices and severity of mitral regurgitation in dogs with preclinical degenerative mitral valve disease.
"PURPOSE: Previous reports confirmed that (2S,4R)-4-[(18)F]Fluoroglutamine ([(18)F]GLN) accumulated in bone and bone marrow. This study investigates the potential of using [(18)F]GLN positron emission tomography (PET) to monitor changes of bone marrow activity after chemotherapy (myelosuppression). PROCEDURES: Bone marrow inhibition model in mice was induced by an intravenous injection of chemotherapy drug (doxorubicin or rituximab) and the inhibition was confirmed by routine blood cell counts. Bone uptakes of these four radiotracers (2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose, [(18)F]GLN, 3'-dexoy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT), and sodium [(18)F]fluoride) in the mice were measured after i.v. injection and dissection of femur and tibia, and the uptakes in bone-only (BO) and bone marrow (BM) were obtained after separating bone from bone marrow. Additionally, six volunteers were recruited and evaluated with [(18)F]GLN. The PET-/CT-guided volumes of interests (VOI) in cervical, thoracic, lumbar vertebra, and skull cortical bone were defined as bone marrow or bone for evaluation, respectively. RESULTS: [(18)F]GLN showed a relatively high bone marrow uptake in mice (up to 9.5 +/- 1.3 % ID/g) at 1 h after injection, which was 2.1 times that of [(18)F]FLT. The [(18)F]GLN uptakes in the bone marrow were substantially inhibited by chemotherapy drug. The decrease of [(18)F]GLN's bone marrow uptake was consistent with the reduction of white blood cells (myelosuppression). For [(18)F]GLN/PET imaging in humans, the SUVmean value of bone marrow (1 h after i.v. injection) was between 3.1 and 3.6 in the healthy volunteers (n = 3), and between 1.8 and 2.2 (n = 3) (P < 0.001) in myelosuppression patients, showing a clear reduction of bone marrow uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Dissection experiments in mice showed that [(18)F]GLN displayed relatively high bone marrow uptake, and the uptake was sensitive to bone marrow inhibition induced by doxorubicin/rituximab. The same conclusion was confirmed [(18)F]GLN/PET imaging in humans. Therefore, [(18)F]GLN/PET imaging may be a useful tool to assess reduction of bone marrow activity in cancer patients, who may be at risk of myelosuppression after chemotherapy.

"Dynamic functional connectivity reflects the spatiotemporal organization of spontaneous brain activity in health and disease. Dynamic functional connectivity may be susceptible to artifacts induced by participant motion. This report provides a systematic evaluation of 12 commonly used participant-level confound regression strategies designed to mitigate the effects of micromovements in a sample of 393 youths (ages 8-22 years). Each strategy was evaluated according to a number of benchmarks, including (a) the residual association between participant motion and edge dispersion, (b) distance-dependent effects of motion on edge dispersion, (c) the degree to which functional subnetworks could be identified by multilayer modularity maximization, and (d) measures of module reconfiguration, including node flexibility and node promiscuity. Results indicate variability in the effectiveness of the evaluated pipelines across benchmarks. Methods that included global signal regression were the most consistently effective de-noising strategies.",Evaluation of confound regression strategies for the mitigation of micromovement artifact in studies of dynamic resting-state functional connectivity and multilayer network modularity.
"Background: Central aortic blood pressures and arterial stiffness are better indicators of cardiovascular outcomes than brachial blood pressures. However, their response to renal denervation (RDN) in patients with Stage 3 and Stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not yet been examined. Objective: To evaluate the impact of RDN on central blood pressures (CBP), brachial (office and ambulatory) blood pressures, arterial stiffness, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 24-hour urine protein, and selective cardiac parameters observed on echocardiograms. Design: Single-center, single-arm with pre-/post-RDN follow-up. Setting: Patients were recruited from the multidisciplinary CKD clinic, Regina General Hospital, Canada. Patients: About 25 consecutive patients with Stage 3 or Stage 4 CKD and resistant hypertension, with no radiological or laboratory evidence of secondary causes of hypertension. Measurements: The key measurements were CBP, pulse wave velocity, ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure, office blood pressures on BP Tru, GFR, 24-hour urine protein and sodium, dose and number of blood pressure medication and doses. Methods: The primary outcome measure was the change in CBP from baseline to 6 months post-RDN. Secondary outcome measures included changes in CBP, office blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory pressures, pulse wave velocity, kidney function (eGFR and 24-hour protein excretion), and the change in the number and dose of medications during the 2-year follow-up period. The primary outcome and the secondary outcomes were evaluated using a Friedman's analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for changes from post RDN procedure. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust P values for multiple testing. A two-sided alpha of .05 was used. Results: Median central blood pressures (mm Hg) were 127/75 at baseline versus 118/70 at 6 months and 118/67 at 24 months (P = .13). Median office blood pressures (mm Hg) were 148/76 at baseline versus 135/75 at 6 months and 133/75 at 24 months (P </= .001). Median ambulatory 24-hour day (mm Hg) was 148/64 at baseline and 146/68 at 6 months and 152/67 at 24 months (P = .60). Median pulse wave velocity (m/s) at baseline was 13.8 at baseline versus 13.3 m/s at 6 months and 12.3 at 12 months' time (P = .62). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/1.73m(2)) at baseline was 37, at 6 months was 36 and 34 at 24 months (P = .33). Limitations: Single-center study, with no sham arm. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that there was a significant improvement in office blood pressures from baseline to 6 months, maintained to 24 months. There was a numerical improvement in central pressures, and pulse wave velocity at 6 and 24 months, with no sustained changes noted in 24-hour blood pressure. Kidney function remained at or near baseline throughout the 24 months of observation.

,Testing the assumptions of parametric linear models: the need for biological data mining in disciplines such as human genetics.
"Value-based decision making relies on distributed neural systems that weigh the benefits of actions against the cost required to obtain a given outcome. Perturbations of these systems are thought to underlie abnormalities in action selection seen across many neuropsychiatric disorders. Genetic tools in mice provide a promising opportunity to explore the cellular components of these systems and their molecular foundations. However, few tasks have been designed that robustly characterize how individual mice integrate differential reward benefits and cost in their selection of actions. Here we present a forced-choice, two-alternative task in which each option is associated with a specific reward outcome, and unique operant contingency. We employed global and individual trial measures to assess the choice patterns and behavioral flexibility of mice in response to differing ""choice benefits"" (modeled as varying reward magnitude ratios) and different modalities of ""choice cost"" (modeled as either increasing repetitive motor output to obtain reward or increased delay to reward delivery). We demonstrate that (1) mouse choice is highly sensitive to the relative benefit of outcomes; (2) choice costs are heavily discounted in environments with large discrepancies in relative reward; (3) divergent cost modalities are differentially integrated into action selection; (4) individual mouse sensitivity to reward benefit is correlated with sensitivity to reward costs. These paradigms reveal stable individual animal differences in value-based action selection, thereby providing a foundation for interrogating the neural circuit and molecular pathophysiology of goal-directed dysfunction.",Behavioral Paradigms to Probe Individual Mouse Differences in Value-Based Decision Making.
"INTRODUCTION: The long-standing debate on medical complicity in torture has overlooked the complicity of cognitive scientists-psychologists, psychiatrists and neuroscientists-in the practice of torture as a distinct phenomenon. In this paper, we identify the risk of the re-emergence of torture as a practice in the USA, and the complicity of cognitive scientists in these practices. METHODS: We review arguments for physician complicity in torture. We argue that these defences fail to defend the complicity of cognitive scientists. We address objections to our account, and then provide recommendations for professional associations in resisting complicity in torture. RESULTS: Arguments for cognitive scientist complicity in torture fail when those actions stem from the same reasons as physician complicity. Cognitive scientist involvement in the torture programme has, from the outset, been focused on the outcomes of interrogation rather than supportive care. Any possibility of a therapeutic relationship between cognitive therapists and detainees is fatally undermined by therapists' complicity with torture. CONCLUSION: Professional associations ought to strengthen their commitment to refraining from engaging in any aspect of torture. They should also move to protect whistle-blowers against torture programmes who are members of their association. If the political institutions that are supposed to prevent the practice of torture are not strengthened, cognitive scientists should take collective action to compel intelligence agencies to refrain from torture.",Ethical considerations on the complicity of psychologists and scientists in torture.
"E-cigarettes have emerged and soared in popularity in the past ten years, making them the most common tobacco product used among youth in the United States (US). In this review, we discuss what the Surgeon General has called a public health ""epidemic""-the precipitous increase in youth use of e-cigarettes and the health consequences of this behavior. Further, we review tobacco control policy efforts (e.g., Tobacco 21, banning flavors, advertising restrictions, and clean indoor air laws)-efforts proven to be critical in reducing cigarette smoking and smoking-related disease and death among US children and adults-including their potential and challenges regarding managing and mitigating the emergence of e-cigarettes. Finally, we close with a discussion of the efforts of transnational tobacco companies to rebrand themselves using e-cigarettes and other new products.","Electronic Cigarettes and Youth in the United States: A Call to Action (at the Local, National and Global Levels)."
"INTRODUCTION: The proportion of university/college students (UCS) consuming alcohol is similar to the number of those reporting poor sleep, at approximately 30%, the proportion being greater in student athletes (SA). What remains to be understood is if poor sleep potentiates risky behaviors. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the association among sleep difficulties, insomnia symptoms, and insufficient sleep on the risk of driving under the influence of alcohol in a sample of UCS and whether these associations were more pertinent in SA. METHODS: Data from the National University/College Health Assessment was used from the years 2011(-)2014. Questions on number of drinks consumed and behaviors such as driving after drinking alcohol were related to answers to questions pertaining to sleep difficulties, insufficient sleep, and insomnia symptoms. RESULTS: Mean alcohol intake was of about 3 drinks; SA consumed significantly more than student non-athletes (SNA). Binge-drinking episodes were significantly higher among SA than SNA. Difficulty sleeping was associated with an increased likelihood of driving after any drinks and after 5 or more drinks in both groups, effects being stronger among SA. Insomnia was associated with an increased likelihood of driving after any drinks and after 5 or more drinks in SA and after 5 or more drinks in SNA. These effects were stronger among athletes. CONCLUSION: The present study found that self-reported difficulties sleeping, insomnia symptoms, and insufficient sleep are associated with driving after drinking alcohol. This relationship applied to driving after drinking any alcohol or binge drinking and was again stronger among SA than SNA.",Driving After Drinking Alcohol Associated with Insufficient Sleep and Insomnia among Student Athletes and Non-Athletes.
"CONTEXT: A physician workgroup of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine sought to define Curricular Milestones (CM) for Hospice and Palliative Medicine (HPM) fellowship programs. The developed list of CMs would serve as components upon which to organize curriculum and standardize what to teach during training. These would complement Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA's) previously developed by this group and new specialty specific Reporting Milestones (RM's) for HPM developed through the ACGME. OBJECTIVES: To develop and vet CMs for HPM fellowships in the United States. METHODS: A draft of CMs was developed through an iterative consensus group process with repeated cycles of drafting, analyzing and revising by a broadly representative expert workgroup who then gained input from HPM educators at a national meeting workshop. The CM draft was subsequently revised and then vetted through a national survey to 203 fellowship educators. Respondents were asked to ""keep"", ""revise"", or ""exclude"" each proposed CM with space for comments. An agreement of 75% among respondents was set as the criteria a priori for keeping a CM. 84 of the 203 potential respondents participated in the survey. All items met the minimum agreement level of 75% or greater recommending keeping the CM. Greater than 85% of the respondents agreed to keep 19 of the 22 CMs with no revisions. Comments for revisions on other CMs were primarily related to changes in language and formatting, not conceptual underpinnings. CONCLUSION: A group consensus method strengthened by inclusion of a national survey to HPM fellowship educators resulted in a CM document that is both carefully developed and broadly vetted. Along with EPA's and new specialty specific RM's, these CM's offer educators and trainees tools to create more comprehensive curricula and behaviorally based assessment tools for HPM fellowships and their stakeholders.",Development of Curricular Milestones for Hospice and Palliative Medicine Fellowship Training in the United States.
"Normal vitamin D homeostasis is critical for optimal health; nevertheless, vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide public health problem. Vitamin D insufficiency is most commonly due to inadequate cutaneous synthesis of cholecalciferol and/or insufficient intake of vitamin D, but can also arise as a consequence of pathological states such as obesity. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D (calcidiol) are low in obesity, and fail to increase appropriately after vitamin D supplementation. Although sequestration of vitamin D in adipose tissues or dilution of ingested or cutaneously synthesized vitamin D in the large fat mass of obese patients has been proposed to explain these findings, here we investigate the alternative mechanism that reduced capacity to convert parent vitamin D to 25(OH)D due to decreased expression of CYP2R1, the principal hepatic vitamin D 25-hydroxylase. To test this hypothesis, we isolated livers from female mice of 6 to 24 weeks of age, weaned onto either a normal chow diet or a high-fat diet, and determined the abundance of Cyp2r1 mRNA using digital droplet-quantitative PCR. We observed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in Cyp2r1 mRNA in the liver of high-fat diet-fed mice relative to lean-chow-fed female mice. Moreover, there was a significant (p < 0.01) relationship between levels of Cyp2r1 mRNA and serum 25(OH)D concentrations as well as between Cyp2R1 mRNA and the ratio of circulating 25(OH)D3 to cholecalciferol (p < 0.0001). Using linear regression we determined a curve with 25(OH)D3/cholecalciferol versus normalized Cyp2R1 mRNA abundance with an R(2) value of 0.85. Finally, we performed ex vivo activity assays of isolated livers and found that obese mice generated significantly less 25(OH)D3 than lean mice (p < 0.05). Our findings indicate that expression of CYP2R1 is reduced in obesity and accounts in part for the decreased circulating 25(OH)D.

"Twenty-nine Americans die in alcohol-impaired driving crashes daily. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report that identified strategies to reduce alcohol-impaired driving deaths. One strategy suggests amending state laws to reduce the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit from 0.08 to 0.05. Although BAC 0.05 laws would likely reduce alcohol-related deaths, they are also controversial. Critics object to these laws because they restrict individual liberty and fail to consider that individuals value social drinking. We explored the ethical acceptability of BAC 0.05 laws. We made an ethical argument in support of BAC 0.05 laws, which include preventing harm to both drinking drivers and to others. We then considered and rejected liberty-based objections to BAC 0.05 laws. We concluded that BAC 0.05 laws are not only ethically defensible but desirable.

"BACKGROUND: Although cardiology organizations recommend early introduction of palliative care for patients with heart failure (HF), integration has remained challenging, particularly in patients with cardiac devices such as cardiac implantable electronic devices and left ventricular assist devices. Study authors suggest that patients often have limited and erroneous understanding of these devices and their implications for future care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess perceptions of cardiac devices in patients with HF and how these perceptions impacted advance care planning and future expectations. METHODS: This study used qualitative semistructured interviews with 18 community-dwelling patients with New York Heart Association stage II to IV HF. RESULTS: We interviewed 18 patients (mean ejection fraction, 38%; mean age, 64 years; 33% female; 83% white; 39% New York Heart Association class II, 39% class III, and 22% class IV). All had a cardiac implantable electronic device (6% permanent pacemaker, 56% implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, 28% biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator); 11% had left ventricular assist devices. Patients with devices frequently misunderstood the impact of their device on cardiac function. A majority expressed the belief that the device would forestall further deterioration, regardless of whether this was the case. This anticipation of stability was often accompanied by the expectation that emerging technologies would continue to preempt decline. Citing this faith in technology, these patients frequently saw limited value in advance care planning. CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, patients with cardiac devices overestimated the impact of their devices on preventing disease progression and death and deprioritized advance care planning as a result.","""Why Would I Choose Death?"": A Qualitative Study of Patient Understanding of the Role and Limitations of Cardiac Devices."
"Individuals with methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) duplication syndrome (MDS) have varying degrees of severity in their mobility, hand use, developmental skills, and susceptibility to infections. In the present study, we examine the relationship between duplication size, gene content, and overall phenotype in MDS using a clinical severity scale. Other genes typically duplicated within Xq28 (eg, GDI1, RAB39B, FLNA) are associated with distinct clinical features independent of MECP2. We additionally compare the phenotype of this cohort (n = 48) to other reported cohorts with MDS. Utilizing existing indices of clinical severity in Rett syndrome, we found that larger duplication size correlates with higher severity in total clinical severity scores (r = 0.36; P = 0.02), and in total motor behavioral assessment inventory scores (r = 0.31; P = 0.05). Greater severity was associated with having the RAB39B gene duplicated, although most of these participants also had large duplications. Results suggest that developmental delays in the first 6 months of life, hypotonia, vasomotor disturbances, constipation, drooling, and bruxism are common in MDS. This is the first study to show that duplication size is related to clinical severity. Future studies should examine whether large duplications which do not encompass RAB39B also contribute to clinical severity. Results also suggest the need for creating an MDS specific severity scale.",Characterizing the phenotypic effect of Xq28 duplication size in MECP2 duplication syndrome.
"A lack of adequate physical activity among young African American women remains a serious public health challenge. Few evidence-based interventions are available to increase physical activity in this population, and none has leveraged mobile technologies, even though African Americans are among the most avid users of mobile applications (apps). We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a mobile app-based small-group intervention in increasing physical activity among African American women aged 18 to 35 years (N = 91) in Philadelphia, PA. Cohorts of eight participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a 4-women small-group intervention or an individual control condition. Control participants used the app to track their own activities. Small-group participants could track their own activities and those of the other three women in their group and could message the other women using a chatting tool. The primary outcome was meeting the goal of engaging in at least 90 min/day of light physical activity during the 3-month study period objectively assessed by a Fitbit device. Data were collected in 2016 and analyzed in 2017. Group participants had higher odds of meeting the goal (OR = 1.48, p = .048) than did control participants, an effect that did not wane during the 3-month study period. Irrespective of condition, participants had lower body-mass index (p = .01) and performed more push-ups (p < .0001) at the 1-month and 3-month assessments compared with the baseline measures.

"Two problems that arise in making causal inferences for nonmortality outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are unmeasured confounding and censoring by death, ie, the outcome is observed only when subjects survive. In randomized experiments with noncompliance and no censoring by death, instrumental variable (IV) methods can be used to control for the unmeasured confounding. But, when there is censoring by death, the average causal treatment effect cannot be identified under usual assumptions but can be studied for a specific subpopulation by using sensitivity analysis with additional assumptions. However, evaluating the local average treatment effect (LATE) in observational studies with censoring by death problems while controlling for unmeasured confounding is not well studied. We develop a novel sensitivity analysis method based on IV models for studying the LATE. Specifically, we present the identification results under an additional assumption and propose a three-step procedure for the LATE estimation. Also, we propose an improved two-step procedure by simultaneously estimating the instrument propensity score (ie, the probability of instrument given covariates) and the parameters induced by the assumption. We show with simulation studies that the two-step procedure can be more robust and efficient than the three-step procedure. Finally, we apply our sensitivity analysis methods to a study on the effect of delivery at high-level neonatal intensive care units on the risk of BPD.",Sensitivity analyses for average treatment effects when outcome is censored by death in instrumental variable models.
"Importance: Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is a rare granulomatous condition. Current knowledge of its key features is based on a limited number of studies and case reports, leading to wide variability in the characterization of its defining features, with limited comparison of patients with or without diabetes. Objective: To evaluate the epidemiologic characteristics, clinical features, and disease associations of NL in patients with or without type 1 or 2 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter retrospective review included 236 patients aged 15 to 84 years who were evaluated and received a diagnosis of NL at the University of Pennsylvania Health System between January 1, 2008, and July 15, 2018; University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between January 1, 2000, and June 15, 2018; and Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital between January 1, 2000, and February 15, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient demographics, clinical features, medical comorbidities, and biopsy status. Results: Of the 236 patients with NL, 200 were women and 36 were men, and 182 were white, with a median age at presentation of 50.0 years (interquartile range, 33.0-59.0 years). The diagnosis was biopsy proven in 156 patients (66.1%). Of the 230 patients with location specified, 225 (97.8%) had NL on the lower legs. A total of 138 patients with NL (58.5%; 95% CI, 52.7%-65.3%) had diabetes. The median hemoglobin A1c for patients with diabetes was 8.00% (interquartile range, 6.68%-9.50%) (to convert hemoglobin A1c to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01). Patients with diabetes were significantly younger than patients without diabetes (median age, 45.0 vs 52.0 years; P = .005), and slightly less likely to be female (112 of 138 [81.2%] vs 87 of 96 [90.6%]; P = .046), but lesion characteristics were otherwise comparable. Other notable comorbidities included obesity in 95 of 184 patients (51.6%; 95% CI, 44.4%-58.9%), hypertension in 104 of 230 patients (45.2%), dyslipidemia in 98 of 225 patients (43.6%), and thyroid disease in 56 of 229 patients (24.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: This study of NL supports its associations with diabetes as well as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and thyroid disease. Younger age and female sex were observed more frequently in patients with diabetes. Otherwise, NL lesions in patients with or without diabetes shared many clinical features, suggesting that risk factors outside of elevated blood glucose may play an important role in the disease. Future studies should evaluate these associations with the goal of further elucidating NL's underlying pathophysiologic characteristics.",Clinical Features and Comorbidities of Patients With Necrobiosis Lipoidica With or Without Diabetes.
"OBJECTIVES: Previous cross-sectional studies have demonstrated obesity rates in children with CHD and the general paediatric population. We reviewed longitudinal data to identify factors predisposing to the development of obesity in children, hypothesising that age may be an important risk factor for body mass index growth.Study designRetrospective electronic health records were reviewed in all 5-20-year-old CHD patients seen between 2011 and 2015, and in age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched controls. Subjects were stratified into aged cohorts of 5-10, 11-15, and 15-20. Annualised change in body mass index percentile (BMI%) over this period was compared using paired Student's t-test. Linear regression analysis was performed with the CHD population. RESULTS: A total of 223 CHD and 223 matched controls met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Prevalence of combined overweight/obesity did not differ significantly between the CHD cohort (24.6-25.8%) and matched controls (23.3-29.1%). Univariate analysis demonstrated a significant difference of BMI% change in the age cohort of 5-10 (CHD +4.1%/year, control +1.7%/year, p=0.04), in male sex (CHD +1.8%/year, control -0.3%/year, p=0.01), and status-post surgery (CHD 2.03%/year versus control 0.37%, p=0.02). Linear regression analysis within the CHD subgroup demonstrated that age 5-10 years (+4.80%/year, p&lt;0.001) and status-post surgery (+3.11%/year, p=0.013) were associated with increased BMI% growth. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence rates of overweight/obesity did not differ between children with CHD and general paediatric population over a 5-year period. Longitudinal data suggest that CHD patients in the age cohort 5-10 and status-post surgery may be at increased risk of BMI% growth relative to peers with structurally normal hearts.",Risk factors for development of obesity in an ethnically diverse CHD population.
"In sickle cell disease (SCD), sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes upon deoxygenation, resulting in sickling of red blood cells (RBCs). These sickled RBCs have strongly reduced deformability, leading to vaso-occlusive crises and chronic hemolytic anemia. To date, there are no reliable laboratory parameters or assays capable of predicting disease severity or monitoring treatment effects. We here report on the oxygenscan, a newly developed method to measure RBC deformability (expressed as Elongation Index - EI) as a function of pO2 . Upon a standardized, 22 minute, automated cycle of deoxygenation (pO2 median 16 mmHg +/- 0.17) and reoxygenation, a number of clinically relevant parameters are produced in a highly reproducible manner (coefficients of variation <5%). In particular, physiological modulators of oxygen affinity, such as, pH and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate showed a significant correlation (respectively R = -0.993 and R = 0.980) with Point of Sickling (PoS5% ), which is defined as the pO2 where a 5% decrease in EI is observed during deoxygenation. Furthermore, in vitro treatment with antisickling agents, including GBT440, which alter the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, caused a reproducible left-shift of the PoS, indicating improved deformability at lower oxygen tensions. When RBCs from 21 SCD patients were analyzed, we observed a significantly higher PoS in untreated homozygous SCD patients compared to treated patients and other genotypes. We conclude that the oxygenscan is a state-of-the-art technique that allows for rapid analysis of sickling behavior in SCD patients. The method is promising for personalized treatment, development of new treatment strategies and could have potential in prediction of complications.",Rapid and reproducible characterization of sickling during automated deoxygenation in sickle cell disease patients.
"Techniques to localize vector transgenes in cells and tissues are essential in order to fully characterize gene therapy outcomes. In situ hybridization (ISH) uses synthesized complementary RNA or DNA nucleotide probes to localize and detect sequences of interest in fixed cells, tissue sections, or whole tissue mounts. Variations in techniques include adding labels to probes, such as fluorophores, which can allow for the simultaneous visualization of multiple targets. Here we provide the steps necessary to: (1) label probes for colorimetric visualization and (2) perform ISH on OCT cryo-preserved fixed frozen tissues.",In Situ Hybridization for Detection of AAV-Mediated Gene Expression.
"The presence of multiple dysmorphic features in some children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) might identify distinct ASD phenotypes and serve as potential markers for understanding causes and prognoses. To evaluate dysmorphology in ASD, children aged 3-6 years with ASD and non-ASD population controls (POP) from the Study to Explore Early Development were evaluated using a novel, systematic dysmorphology review approach. Separate analyses were conducted for non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic children. In each racial/ethnic group, ~ 17% of ASD cases were Dysmorphic compared with ~ 5% of POP controls. The ASD-POP differential was not explained by known genetic disorders or birth defects. In future epidemiologic studies, subgrouping ASD cases as Dysmorphic vs. Non-dysmorphic might help delineate risk factors for ASD.",A Novel Approach to Dysmorphology to Enhance the Phenotypic Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Study to Explore Early Development.
"Coagulation and inflammation are interconnected, suggesting coagulation plays a key role in the inflammatory response to pathogens. A Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) was used to identify clinical phenotypes of patients with a polymorphism in coagulation Factor X. Patients with this SNP were more likely to be hospitalized with hemostatic and infection-related disorders, suggesting Factor X contributes to the immune response to infection. To investigate this, we modeled infections by human pathogens in a mouse model of Factor X deficiency. Factor X-deficient mice were protected from systemic A. baumannii infection, suggesting Factor X plays a role in the immune response to A. baumannii Factor X deficiency was associated with reduced cytokine and chemokine production and alterations in immune cell population during infection: Factor X deficient mice demonstrated increased abundance of neutrophils, macrophages, and effector T cells. Together, these results suggest that Factor X activity is associated with an inefficient immune response and contributes to the pathology of A. baumannii infection.",PheWAS uncovers a pathological role of coagulation Factor X during Acinetobacter baumannii infection.

"OBJECTIVE: The use of acid suppression therapies in newborns lacks efficacy and is associated with adverse effects. Point-of-care (POC) assessment of gastric aspirate pH may provide an objective, noninvasive measure of gastric acidity in tube fed infants. We conducted the present study to characterize the POC gastric pH levels in gastric tube fed infants before and after initiation of enteral omeprazole or ranitidine. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of infants with gastric aspirate pH levels determined by POC pH strips. Gastric pH levels recorded during 7 days before and 14 days after medication initiation were compared using Wilcoxon's sign-rank tests. RESULT: Among 307 evaluated infants, 284 (92%) had a median gastric pH level >/=4 in 7 days prior to ranitidine or omeprazole. In 14 days after medication initiation, the median gastric pH of infants with pretreatment median gastric pH < 4 increased to 4.5 and 5 (p < 0.01) in the ranitidine and omeprazole groups, respectively. There was no change in infants with pretreatment median gastric pH >/=4. CONCLUSION: Among infants receiving gastric tube feedings and enteral omeprazole or ranitidine, only those with a pretreatment gastric pH level <4 demonstrated a significant increase in gastric pH. Validation of our findings against esophageal pH multichannel intraluminal impedance testing is needed.",Use of Point-of-Care Gastric pH Testing to Assess the Efficacy of Acid Suppression Therapy in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
"BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been proposed as a modality to assess patients in the setting of cardiac arrest, both during resuscitation care and following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). In this study we aimed to assess the feasibility and clinical impact of TEE during the emergency department (ED) evaluation during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study consisting of a convenience sample of adult patients presenting to the ED of an urban university medical center with non-traumatic OHCA. TEE was performed by emergency physicians following intubation. Images and clinical data were analyzed. TEE was used intra-arrest in order to assist in diagnosis, assess cardiac activity and determine CPR quality by assessing area of maximal compression (AMC), using a 4 view protocol. RESULTS: A total of 33 OHCA patients were enrolled over a one-year period, 21 patients (64%) presented with ongoing CPR and 12 (36%) presented with ROSC. The 4-view protocol was completed in 100% of the cases, with an average time from ED arrival to TEE of 12 min (min 3 max 30 SD 8.16). Fine ventricular fibrillation (VF) was recognized in 4 (12%) cases thought to be in asystole, leading to defibrillation, and 2 cases of pseudo-PEA were identified. Right ventricular (RV) dilation, was seen in 12 (57%) intraarrest cases. Intra-cardiac thrombus was found in one case, leading to thrombolysis. The AMC was identified over the aortic root or LVOT in 53% of cases. TEE was found to have diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic clinical impact in 32 of the 33 cases (97%). CONCLUSIONS: TEE is feasible and clinically impactful during OHCA management. Resuscitative TEE may allow for characterization of cardiac activity, including identification of pseudo-PEA and fine VF, determination of reversible pathology, and optimization of CPR quality.",Evaluation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using transesophageal echocardiography in the emergency department.
"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the content of parental discussions with young adolescents about reproductive health topics. We sought to characterize the messages mothers share about contraception and condoms. DESIGN: Recruitment occurred between January 2012 and May 2013. Mothers and their 12- to 14-year-old adolescent son or daughter were invited to participate in a semi-structured conversation about everyday issues and health topics, including reproductive health topics. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed and a grounded theory approach to content analysis performed. Content analysis was performed to characterize maternal messages regarding contraception and condoms. SETTING: Urban city in western Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five dyads; 14 mother-daughter dyads and 11 mother-son dyads. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES(S): Maternal reproductive health messages during conversations with early adolescent children. RESULTS: Four key themes emerged. Theme 1 focused on general facts about condoms and contraceptive methods, how each works, and how to obtain them. Theme 2 emphasized the consequences of sexual behaviors and the advantages of safe sex. Theme 3 conveyed the effectiveness of condoms and contraceptive methods for preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Theme 4 described where adolescents could get more information about condoms and contraception.

"BACKGROUND: The determinants of practice guideline panels' recommendations remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors considered by members of 8 panels convened by the American Society of Hematology to develop guidelines when using the GRADE system. METHODS: Two level hierarchical, random-effect, multivariable logistic regression analysis to explore the relation between GRADE and non-GRADE factors and strength of recommendations (SOR). RESULTS: In the primary analysis, certainty in evidence [OR=1.83; (95CI% 1.45 to 2.31)], balance of benefits and harms [OR=1.49 (95CI% 1.30 to 1.69)] and variability or uncertainty in patients' values and preferences [OR=1.47 (95CI% 1.15 to 1.88)] proved the strongest predictors of SOR. In a secondary analysis, certainty of evidence was associated with a strong recommendation [OR=3.60 (95% CI 2.16 to 6.00)] when panel members recommended ""for"" interventions but not when they made recommendations ""against"" [OR=0.98 (95%CI: 0.57 to 1.8)]. Agreement between individual members and the group in rating SOR varied (kappa ranged from -0.01 to 0.64). CONCLUSION: Factors associated with GRADE's conceptual framework proved, in general, highly associated with SOR. Low agreement between individual panel members and group consensus, and failure of certainty of evidence to be associated with SOR against an intervention, suggest the need for improvements in the process.",A highly structured decision-making process results in GRADE factors having primary influence on how guidelines panels develop clinical recommendations.
"Following injury, axons of the peripheral nervous system have retained the capacity for regeneration. While it is well established that injury signals require molecular motors for their transport from the injury site to the nucleus, whether kinesin and dynein motors play additional roles in peripheral nerve regeneration is not well understood. Here we use genetic mutants of motor proteins in a zebrafish peripheral nerve regeneration model to visualize and define in vivo roles for kinesin and dynein. We find that both kinesin-1 and dynein are required for zebrafish peripheral nerve regeneration. While loss of kinesin-1 reduced the overall robustness of axonal regrowth, loss of dynein dramatically impaired axonal regeneration and also reduced injury-induced Schwann cell remodeling. Chimeras between wild type and dynein mutant embryos demonstrate that dynein function in neurons is sufficient to promote axonal regrowth. Finally, by simultaneously monitoring actin and microtubule dynamics in regenerating axons we find that dynein appears dispensable to initiate axonal regrowth, but is critical to stabilize microtubules, thereby sustaining axonal regeneration. These results reveal two previously unappreciated roles for dynein during peripheral nerve regeneration, initiating injury induced Schwann cell remodeling and stabilizing axonal microtubules to sustain axonal regrowth.",Dynein promotes sustained axonal growth and Schwann cell remodeling early during peripheral nerve regeneration.
"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of global health in graduate medical education in the United States (US) has soared over the past two decades. The majority of US internal medicine and pediatric residency programs now offer global health electives abroad. Despite the prevalence of global health electives among US graduate medical programs today, challenges exist that may impact the experience for visiting trainees and/or host institutions. Previous reviews have predominately focused on experiences of undergraduate medical students and have primarily described positive outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to summarize the overall impact of global health electives on US internal medicine, medicine-pediatric, and pediatric residents, paying specific attention to any negative themes reported in the literature. METHODS: An Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid EMBASE literature search was conducted to identify studies that evaluated the effects of global health electives on US internal medicine, medicine-pediatric, and pediatric residents. FINDINGS: Ten studies were included. Four positive themes emerged: (1) improvement of medical knowledge, physical examination, and procedural skills, (2) improvement in resourcefulness and cost-effectiveness, (3) improvement in cultural and interpersonal competence, and (4) professional and career development. Two negative themes were identified: (1) health risks and (2) safety risks. CONCLUSIONS: Global health electives provide a number of perceived benefits for US medical trainees; however, we importantly highlight health and safety concerns described while abroad. Global health educators should recognize the host of unique challenges experienced during a global health elective and investigate how to best mitigate these concerns. Incorporation of mandatory pre-, intra-, and post-elective training programs and establishment of universally adopted global health best practice guidelines may serve to address some the challenges visiting trainees encounter while abroad.",Impact of Global Health Electives on US Medical Residents: A Systematic Review.
"OBJECTIVE: To present a narrative review of the history of bioethics in Latin America and of scientific output in this interdisciplinary field. METHODS: This was a mixed-methods study. RESULTS: A total of 1458 records were retrieved, of which 1167 met the inclusion criteria. According to the Web of Science classification, the predominant topics of study were medical ethics (n= 488), social sciences and medicine (n= 354), and environmental and public health topics (n= 279). Four themes of bioethics output in the Latin American literature have emerged: (a) issues involving the beginning and end of life, (b) ethics in human research, (c) patient-provider relationships, and (d) ethics training for health professionals. CONCLUSION: Although bioethics is a growing interdisciplinary field in Latin America, its academic impact is still very low, and programmes are highly concentrated in large urban centres in a few countries. Challenges includes the regional and international impact of local scientific output.","Mapping Bioethics in Latin America: History, Theoretical Models, and Scientific Output."
"AIMS: The failing heart is energy-starved and inefficient due to perturbations in energy metabolism. Although ketone oxidation has been shown recently to increase in the failing heart, it remains unknown whether this improves cardiac energy production or efficiency. We therefore assessed cardiac metabolism in failing hearts and determined whether increasing ketone oxidation improves cardiac energy production and efficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice underwent sham or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery to induce pressure overload hypertrophy over 4-weeks. Isolated working hearts from these mice were perfused with radiolabelled ss-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, or palmitate to assess cardiac metabolism. Ejection fraction decreased by 45% in TAC mice. Failing hearts had decreased glucose oxidation while palmitate oxidation remained unchanged, resulting in a 35% decrease in energy production. Increasing ssOHB levels from 0.2 to 0.6 mM increased ketone oxidation rates from 251+/-24 to 834+/-116 nmol.g dry wt-1.min-1 in TAC hearts, rates which were significantly increased compared to sham hearts and occurred without decreasing glycolysis, glucose or palmitate oxidation rates. Therefore, the contribution of ketones to energy production in TAC hearts increased to 18% and total energy production increased by 23%. Interestingly, glucose oxidation, in parallel with total ATP production, was also significantly upregulated in hearts upon increasing ssOHB levels. However, while overall energy production increased, cardiac efficiency was not improved. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing ketone oxidation rates in failing hearts increases overall energy production without compromising glucose or fatty acid metabolism, albeit without increasing cardiac efficiency.",Increased ketone body oxidation provides additional energy for the failing heart without improving cardiac efficiency.
"Background: The gut microbiome is influenced by early-life exposures, but-despite potentially enormous implications for child health-is understudied in environmental epidemiology. This pilot study is one of the first to explore in utero exposures and long-term gut microbiome profiles. We examined the association between exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) during pregnancy and the mid-childhood gut microbiome. Methods: We measured levels of PBDE-47, -99, -100, and -153 and PCB-138, -153, and -180 in maternal plasma during early pregnancy (n=18) and at delivery (n=25) in women of European descent who breastfed the child participant of the Gestation and Environment cohort in Sherbrooke, Quebec (recruited 2007-2009). Bacteria in the mid-childhood (6-8 years) fecal microbiome were detected with 16S rRNA sequencing. To test for differences at the taxon level, we used the Microbiome Comprehensive Association Mapping algorithm. Results: Early pregnancy PCB-153, -180, and the sum of PCBs (Sigma3PCB) concentrations were associated with a higher relative abundance of Propionibacteriales and Propionibacteriaceae in mid-childhood. Higher PCB-180 and Sigma3PCB were associated with higher relative abundance of Bacillales Family XI. Higher PBDE-99 exposure was associated with a decrease in uncultured bacteria within the Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group and PBDE-47 was associated with differences in Ruminococcus 2. These taxon-level changes did not result in differences in within- or between-subject diversity. Exposures at delivery were not associated with differences in taxa. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to PCBs and PBDEs is associated with mid-childhood gut microbiome profiles. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results and explore health implications.",Associations of prenatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and polychlorinated biphenyls with long-term gut microbiome structure: a pilot study.

"BACKGROUND: Injury is one of the most prevalent potentially emotionally traumatic events that children experience and can lead to persistent impaired physical and emotional health. There is a need for interventions that promote full physical and emotional recovery and that can be easily accessed by all injured children. Based on research evidence regarding post-injury recovery, we created the Cellie Coping Kit for Children with Injury intervention to target key mechanisms of action and refined the intervention based on feedback from children, families, and experts in the field. The Cellie Coping Kit intervention is parent-guided and includes a toy (for engagement), coping cards for children, and a book for parents with evidence-based strategies to promote injury recovery. This pilot research trial aims to provide an initial evaluation of the impact of the Cellie Coping Kit for Children with Injury on proximal targets (coping, appraisals) and later child health outcomes (physical recovery, emotional health, health-related quality of life). METHOD / DESIGN: Eighty children (aged 8-12 years) and their parents will complete a baseline assessment (T1) and then will be randomly assigned to an immediate intervention group or waitlist group. The Cellie Coping Kit for Injury Intervention will be introduced to the immediate intervention group after the T1 assessment and to the waitlist group following the T3 assessment. Follow-up assessments of physical and emotional health will be completed at 6 weeks (T2), 12 weeks (T3), and 18 weeks (T4). DISCUSSION: This will be one of the first randomized controlled trials to examine an intervention tool intended to promote full recovery after pediatric injury and be primarily implemented by children and parents. Results will provide data on the feasibility of the implementation of the Cellie Coping Intervention for Injury as well as estimations of efficacy. Potential strengths and limitations of this design are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03153696 .

"Background: Although anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears have received the most attention, the medial collateral ligament (MCL) is thought to be the most commonly injured knee ligament overall. The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and posterior collateral ligament (PCL) are less frequently compromised but can be involved in severe multiligament injuries. The paucity of information on the native properties of these ligaments in the pediatric population hinders the overall optimization of treatment for these injuries. Purpose: To characterize the mechanical and microstructural properties of pediatric MCLs, LCLs, and PCLs using a rare cadaveric cohort (mean age, 9.2 years). Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: MCLs, LCLs, and PCLs were harvested from 5 fresh-frozen pediatric knee specimens (3 male, 2 female) and were subjected to a tensile loading protocol. A subset of contralateral tissues from a single donor was analyzed using bright-field, polarized light, and transmission electron microscopy to measure collagen fiber morphology. Results: The pediatric MCL exhibited values for ultimate stress (11.7 +/- 6.7 MPa), ultimate strain (18.2% +/- 6.8%), and the Young modulus (93.7 +/- 56.5 MPa) that were similar to values for the LCL (11.4 +/- 11.5 MPa, 27.7% +/- 12.9%, and 64.4 +/- 76.6 MPa, respectively). The PCL demonstrated decreased ultimate stress (4.2 +/- 1.8 MPa), increased ultimate strain (28.8% +/- 11.9%), and a decreased Young modulus (19.8 +/- 10.4 MPa) when compared with the MCL and LCL. All 3 ligaments had similar mean crimp wavelengths (MCL, 32.8 +/- 3.6 microm; LCL, 27.2 +/- 3.5 microm; PCL, 25.8 +/- 3.5 microm) and collagen fibril diameters (MCL, 88.0 +/- 26.0 nm; LCL, 93.3 +/- 34.6 nm; PCL, 90.9 +/- 34.0 nm); however, the fibril distribution profiles exhibited different modalities. Conclusion: The pediatric MCL and LCL possessed similar mechanical properties, while the pediatric PCL was weaker but capable of withstanding higher amounts of strain. All 3 of these pediatric structures were weaker than what has been reported in studies with adult cohorts. Clinical Relevance: Results from this study can be considered preliminary mechanical and microstructural data for healthy pediatric collateral and posterior cruciate ligaments that can be used to guide further laboratory and clinical research.",Mechanical and Microstructural Properties of Native Pediatric Posterior Cruciate and Collateral Ligaments.
"Paclitaxel is a first-line drug for treating epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). However, prognosis for patients with advanced stage cancer remains poor due to primary or acquired drug resistance. Therefore, overcoming chemoresistance is one of the greatest challenges in treating EOC. In this study, we identified microRNAs (miRNA) that regulate paclitaxel resistance and tested their potential utility as therapeutic targets. Paclitaxel-resistant cell lines were established using two EOC cell lines: SKVO3ip1 and HeyA8. miRNA PCR arrays showed that miR-194-5p was downregulated in paclitaxel-resistant cells. Forced expression of miR-194-5p resensitized resistant cells to paclitaxel. Conversely, miR-194-5p inhibition induced paclitaxel resistance in parental cells. In silico analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that MDM2 is a direct target of miR-194-5p. MDM2 was upregulated in paclitaxel resistant cells compared with parental cells. MDM2 inhibition also resensitized resistant cells to paclitaxel and forced MDM2 induced paclitaxel resistance in parental cells. miR-194-5p induced p21 upregulation and G1 phase arrest in resistant cells by downregulating MDM2. Furthermore, a public database showed that high MDM2 expression was associated with a shorter progression-free survival in EOC patients treated with paclitaxel. Collectively, our results show that restoring miR-194-5p expression resensitizes EOCs to paclitaxel, and this may be exploited as a therapeutic option.",Downregulation of miR-194-5p induces paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells by altering MDM2 expression.
"Background: Reversible obstruction on spirometry may be used to diagnose asthma. As per 2005 American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines, our pulmonary center began using 360 microg (four puffs) of albuterol rather than 180 microg (two puffs) to determine reversibility on spirometry starting in 2009. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that fewer patients would respond to two puffs of albuterol than four puffs during spirometric testing. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records from new asthmatics seen in Pediatric Pulmonary Clinic from March 2002 to April 2014 who performed reproducible spirometry. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether they had received two or four puffs of albuterol for bronchodilator assessment. A positive bronchodilator response was defined as an increase of >/=12% in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or >/=25% in forced expiratory flow (FEF25-75%). Data were expressed as percentages and mean +/- standard error of the mean values. Chi-squared test and Student's t-test were utilized. Results: Data were collected for 240 patients; 115 patients received two puffs of albuterol and 125 patients received four puffs. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. There were no differences following two puffs or four puffs in changes in FEV1 (10.0+/-1.1% vs 10.5+/-1.1% predicted) or FEF25-75% (30.2+/-2.9% vs 33.5+/-2.9% predicted). Moreover, there was no difference in ATS-defined bronchodilator response between the two groups. Conclusion: Based on the mean change in FEV1 and overall bronchodilator responsiveness, two puffs of albuterol were not inferior to four puffs in the determination of bronchodilator responsiveness in our pediatric asthmatic patients.",Two vs four puffs of albuterol: does dose change bronchodilator response?
"Essentials Factor XIII is a heterotetramer with 2 catalytic A subunits and 2 non-catalytic B subunits. Structure of active and inactive factor XIII was studied with atomic force microscopy. Inactive factor XIII is made of an A2 globule and 2 flexible B subunits extending from it. Activated factor XIII separates into a B2 homodimer and 2 monomeric active A subunits. SUMMARY: Background Factor XIII (FXIII) is a precursor of the blood plasma transglutaminase (FXIIIa) that is generated by thrombin and Ca(2+) and covalently crosslinks fibrin to strengthen blood clots. Inactive plasma FXIII is a heterotetramer with two catalytic A subunits and two non-catalytic B subunits. Inactive A subunits have been characterized crystallographically, whereas the atomic structure of the entire FXIII and B subunits is unknown and the oligomerization state of activated A subunits remains controversial. Objectives Our goal was to characterize the (sub)molecular structure of inactive FXIII and changes upon activation. Methods Plasma FXIII, non-activated or activated with thrombin and Ca(2+) , was studied by single-molecule atomic force microscopy. Additionally, recombinant separate A and B subunits were visualized and compared with their conformations and dimensions in FXIII and FXIIIa. Results and Conclusions We showed that heterotetrameric FXIII forms a globule composed of two catalytic A subunits with two flexible strands comprising individual non-catalytic B subunits that protrude on one side of the globule. Each strand corresponds to seven to eight out of 10 tandem repeats building each B subunit, called sushi domains. The remainder were not seen, presumably because they were tightly bound to the globular A2 dimer. Some FXIII molecules had one or no visible strands, suggesting dissociation of the B subunits from the globular core. After activation of FXIII with thrombin and Ca(2+) , B subunits dissociated and formed B2 homodimers, whereas the activated globular A subunits dissociated into monomers. These results characterize the molecular organization of FXIII and changes with activation.",Factor XIII topology: organization of B subunits and changes with activation studied with single-molecule atomic force microscopy.

"Our understanding of human evolution has improved rapidly over recent decades, facilitated by large-scale cataloguing of genomic variability amongst both modern and archaic humans. It seems clear that the evolution of the ancestors of chimpanzees and hominins separated 7-9 million years ago with some migration out of Africa by the earlier hominins; Homo sapiens slowly emerged as climate change resulted in drier, less forested African conditions. The African populations expanded and evolved in many different conditions with slow mutation and selection rates in the human genome, but with much more rapid mutation occurring in mitochondrial DNA. We now have evidence stretching back 300 000 years of humans in their current form, but there are clearly four very different large African language groups that correlate with population DNA differences. Then, about 50 000-100 000 years ago a small subset of modern humans also migrated out of Africa resulting in a persistent signature of more limited genetic diversity amongst non-African populations. Hybridization with archaic hominins occurred around this time such that all non-African modern humans possess some Neanderthal ancestry and Melanesian populations additionally possess some Denisovan ancestry. Human populations both within and outside Africa also adapted to diverse aspects of their local environment including altitude, climate, UV exposure, diet and pathogens, in some cases leaving clear signatures of patterns of genetic variation. Notable examples include haemoglobin changes conferring resistance to malaria, other immune changes and the skin adaptations favouring the synthesis of vitamin D. As humans migrated across Eurasia, further major mitochondrial changes occurred with some interbreeding with ancient hominins and the development of alcohol intolerance. More recently, an ability to retain lactase persistence into adulthood has evolved rapidly under the environmental stimulus of pastoralism with the ability to husband lactating ruminants. Increased amylase copy numbers seem to relate to the availability of starchy foods, whereas the capacity to desaturase and elongate monounsaturated fatty acids in different societies seems to be influenced by whether there is a lack of supply of readily available dietary sources of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The process of human evolution includes genetic drift and adaptation to local environments, in part through changes in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. These genetic changes may underlie susceptibilities to some modern human pathologies including folate-responsive neural tube defects, diabetes, other age-related pathologies and mental health disorders.",Nutrition and its role in human evolution.
"Paediatric Strategy Forums have been created by the multistakeholder organisation, ACCELERATE, and the European Medicines Agency to facilitate dialogue between all relevant stakeholders and suggest strategies in critical areas of paediatric oncology drug development. As there are many medicines being developed for B-cell malignancies in adults but comparatively few in children with these malignancies, a Paediatric Strategy Forum was held to discuss the best approach to develop these products for children. It was concluded that as current frontline therapy is highly successful, despite associated acute toxicity, de-escalation of this or substitution of presently used drugs with new medicines can only be undertaken when there is an effective salvage regimen, which is currently not available. Therefore priority should be given to developing treatment for patients with relapsed and refractory mature B-cell lymphomas. The consensus of the clinicians attending the meeting was that CAR T-cells, T-cell engagers and antibody drug conjugates (excluding those with a vinca alkaloid-like drug) presently have the greatest probability of providing benefit in relapse in view of their mechanism of action. However, as producing autologous CAR T-cells currently takes at least 4 weeks, they are not products which could be quickly employed initially at relapse in rapidly progressing mature B-cell malignancies but only for the consolidation phase of the treatment. Global, industry-supported, academic-sponsored studies testing compounds from different pharmaceutical companies simultaneously should be considered in rare populations, and it was proposed that an international working group be formed to develop an overarching clinical trials strategy for these disease groups. Future Forums are planned for other relevant paediatric oncologic diseases with a high unmet medical need and relevant molecular targets.",ACCELERATE and European Medicine Agency Paediatric Strategy Forum for medicinal product development for mature B-cell malignancies in children.
"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) events are tracked in trauma registries and by administrative datasets. Both databases are used to assess outcomes despite having varying processes for data capture. STUDY DESIGN: This study was performed at an urban, university-based, level-one trauma center from 2004-2014. Retrospective review of the trauma registry and the hospital's administrative database was performed querying for all VTEs. Each VTE was then validated through manual chart review. Confirmed events were those with radiographic evidence of VTE by ultrasound, computed tomography, and/or ventilation/perfusion scan. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated and compared between databases. RESULTS: 19,353 trauma patients were admitted during the study period. 656 VTEs were identified in the registry and 890 were identified via administrative data. 527 potential events were identified by both databases; 129 events were only in registry and 363 were only found in the administrative database. 636/656 events in registry were confirmed: PPV 97% (CI:95.6%-98.3%) vs. 815/890 events in administrative: PPV 91.6% (CI:89.75-93.4%), p<0.001. Sensitivity was higher for administrative (87.2 vs. 68.0, p<0.001) as 299 confirmed VTE events were not in the registry. Differences between the two databases were diminished when the analysis excluded untreated events and those present on admission. 23% of validated DVT events in the registry were upper extremity events. CONCLUSIONS: The trauma registry showed higher specificity and lower sensitivity compared to administrative data. The low false positive rate of the trauma registry supports its validity in VTE outcomes research. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the relevance of the variable sensitivity, likely due to definitional differences. Supplementation of trauma registry data with administrative data may strengthen its completeness.",Whose Benchmark Is Right? Validating Venous Thromboembolism Events between Trauma Registries and Hospital Administrative Databases.
"INTRODUCTION: Improving children's tap water intake and reducing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is beneficial for health and health equity, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color. Existing community level interventions to improve the intake of tap water have predominantly occurred in schools and have focused on promoting water consumption in cafeterias during lunch or snack periods. METHODS: The ""Hydrate Philly"" intervention was developed to target multiple environmental and social factors to improve tap water consumption in community recreation centers in low-income communities: replacing old and unappealing water fountains with appealing water-bottle-filling ""hydration stations"", conducting water safety testing and publicizing results, disseminating reusable water bottles, promoting tap water, and discouraging SSB consumption. Efficacy of the intervention will be tested through a group-randomized controlled trial (n=28 centers) of the intervention's impact on center-level water fountain/station use as measured by flow meters during a youth summer camp program primarily for children aged 6-12years. Intervention impact on the primary outcome (use of drinking water sources) will be examined with a difference-in-differences approach using an ordinary least squares regression model for analysis at the center level. Secondary outcomes include SSBs brought to summer camp, reusable and single-use bottled water use, program trash, and recreation center staff SSB consumption. DISCUSSION: Multilevel approaches are needed to increase tap water intake and decrease SSB consumption among low-income and minority youth beyond school and meal settings. The current study describes the Hydrate Philly intervention, the study design, and baseline characteristics of recreation centers participating in the study.

"A chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus with the glycoprotein of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, VSV-GP, is a potent viral vaccine vector that overcomes several of the limitations of wild-type VSV. Here, we evaluated the potential of VSV-GP as an HIV vaccine vector. We introduced genes for different variants of the HIV-1 envelope protein Env, i.e., secreted or membrane-anchored, intact or mutated furin cleavage site or different C-termini, into the genome of VSV-GP. We found that the addition of the Env antigen did not attenuate VSV-GP replication. All HIV-1 Env variants were expressed in VSV-GP infected cells and some were incorporated very efficiently into VSV-GP particles. Crucial epitopes for binding of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 such as MPER (membrane-proximal external region), CD4 binding site, V1V2 and V3 loop were present on the surface of VSV-GP-Env particles. Binding of quaternary antibodies indicated a trimeric structure of VSV-GP incorporated Env. We detected high HIV-1 antibody titers in mice and showed that vectors expressing membrane-anchored Env elicited higher antibody titers than vectors that secreted Envs. In rabbits, Tier 1A HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies were detectable after prime immunization and titers further increased after boosting with a second immunization. Taken together, VSV-GP-Env is a promising vector vaccine against HIV-1 infection since this vector permits incorporation of native monomeric and/or trimeric HIV-1 Env into a viral membrane.",Induction of Tier 1 HIV Neutralizing Antibodies by Envelope Trimers Incorporated into a Replication Competent Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Vector.
"This retrospective cohort study investigated whether unilateral vision impairment (UVI) or amblyopia are associated with driver licensing and crash risk among adolescents. Electronic health records for New Jersey residents who were patients with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's healthcare network were linked to statewide driver licensing and crash data. We compared young adults with a diagnosis of UVI and/or amblyopia to peers without such a diagnosis. Young adults with UVI or amblyopia were less likely to acquire a driver's license than those without these conditions. However, among licensed drivers, the risk of a police-reported crash was similar in all three groups.",Driver licensing and motor vehicle crash rates among young adults with amblyopia and unilateral vision impairment.

"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies suggest that maternal postpartum mental health issues may have an impact on parenting and child development in preterm infants, but have often not measured symptomatology in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or followed families through early childhood. This study examines how maternal depressive symptoms and stress in the NICU are related to parenting behaviors at age 5 years, in mothers of children born very preterm (at </=30 weeks' gestation). METHOD: This longitudinal study followed a diverse sample of 74 very preterm children and their mothers. Maternal depression and stress were assessed in the NICU. At age 5, mother-child dyads were observed and coded for maternal intrusiveness, negativity, sensitivity, and positivity. Other covariates, including maternal and child intelligence, maternal education, income-to-needs ratio, maternal depression at age 5 years, and child sex were included in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The interaction between maternal NICU stress and NICU depression for intrusiveness and negativity indicates that greater NICU depression was associated with more intrusiveness under medium or high levels of NICU stress, and more negativity under high levels of NICU stress. Furthermore, greater NICU depression was associated with less sensitivity, over and above other covariates. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that early maternal peripartum depression and stress in the NICU can have lasting impacts on multiple parenting behaviors, highlighting the need for screening and targeted interventions in the NICU.",Maternal Depression and Stress in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Associations With Mother-Child Interactions at Age 5 Years.
"OBJECTIVE: Adults with established diagnoses of serious mental illness (bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) exhibit structural brain abnormalities, yet less is known about how such abnormalities manifest earlier in development. METHOD: We analyzed the cross-sectional data publicly available from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Structural magnetic resonance neuroimaging data (sMRI) were collected on a subset of the PNC (N=989, ages 9-22 years old). We calculated measures of cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), along with subcortical volumes. Study participants were assessed for psychiatric symptomatology via structured interview and the following groups were created: typically developing (TD, n=376), psychosis spectrum (PS, n=113), bipolar spectrum (BP, n=117), and BP + PS (n=109). We examined group and developmental differences in sMRI measures. We also examined to what extent any structural aberration was related to neurocognition, global functioning, and clinical symptomatology. RESULTS: In comparison to all other groups, PS youth exhibited significantly reduced SA in orbitofrontal, cingulate, precentral, and postcentral regions. PS youth also exhibited reduced thalamic volume in comparison to all other groups. Strongest effects for precentral and posterior cingulate SA reductions were seen during early adolescence (ages 13-15) in PS youth. Strongest effects for reductions in thalamic volume and orbitofrontal and postcentral SA were observed in mid-adolescence (16-18 years) in PS youth. Across groups, better overall functioning was associated with increased lateral orbitofrontal SA. Increased postcentral SA was associated with better executive cognition and less severe negative symptoms in the entire sample. CONCLUSION: In a community-based sample, we found that reduced cortical SA and thalamic volume are present early in adolescent development in youth with psychosis spectrum symptoms, but not in youth with bipolar spectrum symptoms, or with both bipolar and psychosis spectrum symptoms. These findings point to potential biological distinctions between psychosis and bipolar spectrum conditions, which may suggest additional biomarkers relevant to early identification.",Structural Brain Alterations in Youth With Psychosis and Bipolar Spectrum Symptoms.
"Clinical researchers studying the long-term neurocognitive effects of anesthetic and sedative agents on children continue to struggle with identifying a phenotype for anesthetic neurotoxicity, the window of vulnerability, and the toxicity threshold in terms of concentration and duration. The Sixth Biennial Pediatric Anesthesia Neurodevelopment Assessment (PANDA) symposium at Columbia University included a moderated poster presentation session where 4 investigators presented their latest contributions to the landscape of clinical anesthetic neurotoxicity research. A lack of standardization in the design of clinical studies in terms of age at exposure, duration and type of exposure, and outcome measures assessed were highlighted by all the investigators. Suggestions for the future direction of clinical trials included the implementation of more consistent study parameters and the employment of standardized neurocognitive testing and imaging before and after exposure to general anesthesia. Presentations covered a broad range of topics including the valid translation of preclinical studies to human subjects, the quantification of real-world exposures to anesthetic and sedative medications, and possible alternatives to these exposures.",A Review of Clinical Poster Presentations at the Sixth Biennial Pediatric Anesthesia Neurodevelopment Assessment (PANDA) Symposium.
"Blood cultures are essential for the evaluation of sepsis. However, they may sometimes be obtained inappropriately, leading to high false-positive rates, largely due to contamination.1 As a quality improvement project, clinician decision-support tools for evaluating patients with fever or signs and symptoms of sepsis were implemented in April 2014 in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). This initiative resulted in a 46% decrease in blood culture obtainment2 and has been replicated in other institutions.3 It is important to evaluate antibiotic use as a balancing measure because a reduction in blood cultures could lead to an increase in antibiotic treatment days if clinicians continued empiric treatment in scenarios when blood culture results were not available. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether antibiotic use in the PICU changed in association with a reduction in blood culture utilization.",Association of a blood culture utilization intervention on antibiotic use in a pediatric intensive care unit.
"Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a prodrug that is metabolized in the heme biosynthesis pathway to produce protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) for tumor fluorescence detection and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) has been widely used to enhance PpIX accumulation by inhibiting the iron-dependent bioconversion of PpIX to heme, a reaction catalyzed by ferrochelatase (FECH). Tumor response to DFO treatment is known to be highly variable, and some tumors even show no response. Given the fact that tumors often exhibit reduced FECH expression/enzymatic activity, we examined how reducing FECH level affected the DFO enhancement effect. Our results showed that reducing FECH level by silencing FECH in SkBr3 breast cancer cells completely abrogated the enhancement effect of DFO. Although DFO enhanced ALA-PpIX fluorescence and PDT response in SkBr3 vector control cells, it caused a similar increase in MCF10A breast epithelial cells, resulting in no net gain in the selectivity toward tumor cells. We also found that DFO treatment induced less increase in ALA-PpIX fluorescence in tumor cells with lower FECH activity (MDA-MB-231, Hs 578T) than in tumor cells with higher FECH activity (MDA-MB-453). Our study demonstrates that FECH activity is an important determinant of tumor response to DFO treatment.",Ferrochelatase Deficiency Abrogated the Enhancement of Aminolevulinic Acid-mediated Protoporphyrin IX by Iron Chelator Deferoxamine.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endocannabinoids are critically involved in brain reward functions. This is generally believed to be mediated by activation of CB1 receptors, in large part due to their high density in the brain. However, the recent discovery of CB2 receptors (CB2 R) in the brain, particularly in midbrain dopamine neurons, has challenged this view and inspired us to re-examine the roles of both CB1 R and CB2 R in the effects of cannabis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In the present study, we used the electrical intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) paradigm to evaluate the effects of various cannabinoid drugs on brain reward in laboratory rats, and the roles of CB1 R and CB2 R activation in brain reward function(s). KEY RESULTS: Two mixed CB1 R/CB2 R agonists, Delta(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9) -THC) and WIN55,212-2, produced biphasic effects - mild enhancement of brain-stimulation reward (BSR) at low dose, but inhibition at higher doses. Pretreatment with a CB1 R antagonist (AM251) attenuated the low dose-enhanced BSR, while a CB2 R antagonist (AM630) attenuated high dose-inhibited BSR. To confirm these opposing effects, rats were treated with selective CB1 R and CB2 R agonists, and these produced significant BSR enhancement and inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that CB1 R activation produces reinforcing effects, whereas CB2 R activation is aversive. This suggests that the subjective effects of cannabis may depend on the balance of these opposing effects. Therefore, these findings may not only explain previous conflicting results in animal models of addiction, but also explain why cannabis can be either rewarding or aversive in humans, since CB1 R/CB2 R expression may differ in the brains of different subjects.",Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor mechanisms underlie cannabis reward and aversion in rats.
"PURPOSE: Pediatric patients undergoing complex cranial vault reconstruction (CCVR) are at risk of significant perioperative blood loss requiring blood product transfusion. Minimizing allogeneic blood product transfusion is an important goal because of the associated risks and cost. The impact of patient and surgical variables on transfusion is unknown in this population. Our primary aim was to examine relationships between demographic and perioperative variables and blood product transfusion outcomes in CCVR. METHODS: The multicentre Pediatric Surgery Perioperative Registry was checked for children undergoing CCVR between June 2012 and September 2016. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed examining patient, procedure, and blood conservation variables and their relationship to three outcomes: intraoperative red blood cell-containing product (RBC-CP) transfusion, total perioperative blood donor exposures, and transfusion-free hospitalization. RESULTS: The registry search returned data from 1,814 cases. Age and surgical duration were the only variables significantly associated with all three outcomes studied. Predictors of reduced RBC-CP transfusion included lower American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status and antifibrinolytic administration. Total cranial vault reconstruction, intraoperative vasoactive infusion, and presence of a tracheostomy predicted increased donor exposures. Increased body weight, higher preoperative hematocrit, and utilization of intraoperative cell saver and transfusion protocols were associated with transfusion-free hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Clinical factors associated with increased allogeneic blood product transfusion in pediatric CCVR include: age </= 24 months, ASA status >/= III, preoperative anemia, prolonged surgical duration, lack of intraoperative antifibrinolytic use, lack of intraoperative cell saver use, and the lack of transfusion protocols.",Predictors of transfusion outcomes in pediatric complex cranial vault reconstruction: a multicentre observational study from the Pediatric Craniofacial Collaborative Group.
"We report a case of acute pancreatitis after an elective screening colonoscopy. A 51-year-old male with a left ventricular assist device for end-stage nonischemic cardiomyopathy and a family history of colorectal cancer was admitted for an expedited heart transplant evaluation. He underwent screening colonoscopy during this admission which was technically uncomplicated apart from requiring slight maneuvering at the splenic flexure. The following day, the patient developed acute epigastric pain and one episode of emesis. Subsequent laboratory evaluation revealed a significantly elevated lipase level and cross-sectional imaging consistent with acute pancreatitis. With no evidence of gallstones, alcohol use, and hypertriglyceridemia, the acute pancreatitis was deemed to be a complication of colonoscopy. The presumed mechanism of the pancreatitis was due to mechanical trauma from insufflation and abdominal pressure, applied to at the splenic flexure, which is in close proximity to the pancreatic tail. The patient was treated with supportive care (intravenous fluid, analgesia, and pancreatic rest) and improved significantly over a three-day period.",Acute Pancreatitis after Colonoscopy: A Case Presentation and Literature Review.

"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created enteral device specifications to reduce tubing misconnections. The Global Enteral Device Supplier Association (GEDSA) supports a female design: standard and low dose tip (LDT). Concerns include increased complexity of use with adapters, dosing accuracy and workflow. No peer-reviewed studies have evaluated dosing accuracy of the complete female system with adapters. The objective of this study was to compare dosing accuracy of the female design to legacy syringes. METHODS: An in vitro study was conducted at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy pharmaceutics laboratory. Assessments were completed for syringe size, dispense methods and volumes, and adapters when applicable. A gravimetric scale and specific gravity were used to calculate administration volumes. The primary outcome was frequency administration volume exceeded 10% expected amount. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 576 tests were performed. The LDT resulted in significantly higher rates of unacceptable dosing variance compared to legacy (21.2% vs 7.4%, P = 0.003). Variance exceeding 10% occurred more frequently with LDT 0.5 and 1 mL syringes, medication cup dispensing (liquid or tablet) and inappropriate LDT adapter use. Unapproved adapter processes compared to FDA-approved processes held a higher likelihood of unacceptable dosing variance (28% vs 7.4%, P < 0.001). FDA-approved use of adapters with prefilled syringes compared to bedside administration may result in higher rates of dosing inaccuracy (18.8% vs 5.6%, P = 0.06). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: This study raises clinical concerns of dosing inaccuracies with the LDT syringes, particularly with 0.5 and 1 mL sizes. The use of adapters significantly increases the opportunity for inaccurate dosing.",Female low dose tip syringes-increased complexity of use may compromise dosing accuracy in paediatric patients.
"Mitochondrial complex V (CV) generates cellular energy as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mitochondrial disease caused by the m.8993T>G pathogenic variant in the CV subunit gene MT-ATP6 was among the first described human mitochondrial DNA diseases. Due to a lack of clinically available functional assays, validating the definitive pathogenicity of additional MT-ATP6 variants remains challenging. We reviewed all reportedMT-ATP6 disease cases ( n = 218) to date, to assess for MT-ATP6 variants, heteroplasmy levels, and inheritance correlation with clinical presentation and biochemical findings. We further describe the clinical and biochemical features of a new cohort of 14 kindreds with MT-ATP6 variants of uncertain significance. Despite extensive overlap in the heteroplasmy levels of MT-ATP6 variant carriers with and without a wide range of clinical symptoms, previously reported symptomatic subjects had significantly higher heteroplasmy load (p = 2.2 x 10(-16) ). Pathogenic MT-ATP6 variants resulted in diverse biochemical features. The most common findings were reduced ATP synthesis rate, preserved ATP hydrolysis capacity, and abnormally increased mitochondrial membrane potential. However, no single biochemical feature was universally observed. Extensive heterogeneity exists among both clinical and biochemical features of distinct MT-ATP6 variants. Improved mechanistic understanding and development of consistent biochemical diagnostic analyses are needed to permit accurate pathogenicity assessment of variants of uncertain significance in MT-ATP6.",MT-ATP6 mitochondrial disease variants: Phenotypic and biochemical features analysis in 218 published cases and cohort of 14 new cases.

"About one-third of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) cases are caused by mutations in sarcomere or cytoskeletal proteins. However, treating the cytoskeleton directly is not possible because drugs that bind to actin are not well tolerated. Mutations in the actin binding protein CAP2 can cause DCM and KO mice, either whole body (CAP2-KO) or cardiomyocyte-specific KOs (CAP2-CKO) develop DCM with cardiac conduction disease. RNA sequencing analysis of CAP2-KO hearts and isolated cardiomyocytes revealed overactivation of fetal genes, including serum response factor-regulated (SRF-regulated) genes such as Myl9 and Acta2 prior to the emergence of cardiac disease. To test if we could treat CAP2-KO mice, we synthesized and tested the SRF inhibitor CCG-1423-8u. CCG-1423-8u reduced expression of the SRF targets Myl9 and Acta2, as well as the biomarker of heart failure, Nppa. The median survival of CAP2-CKO mice was 98 days, while CCG-1423-8u-treated CKO mice survived for 116 days and also maintained normal cardiac function longer. These results suggest that some forms of sudden cardiac death and cardiac conduction disease are under cytoskeletal stress and that inhibiting signaling through SRF may benefit DCM by reducing cytoskeletal stress.",Targeting MRTF/SRF in CAP2-dependent dilated cardiomyopathy delays disease onset.
"Actinic keratoses (AKs) and squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) are precursor lesions for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), the second most common form of cancer. Current topical therapies for AKs and SCCIS promote skin inflammation to eradicate lesions and do not directly target the biological mechanisms driving growth. We hypothesized that topical small molecule inhibitors targeting kinases promoting keratinocyte growth in AKs and SCCIS could induce regression of these lesions with less inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we determined the efficacy of topical dasatinib, 5-fluorouracil and BEZ-235 in inducing regression of cSCCs in the K14-Fyn Y528 transgenic mouse model. Topical dasatinib induced regression of cSCC with less inflammation, no ulceration and no mortality compared to 5-fluorouracil. Topical BEZ-235 induced cSCC regression similar to dasatinib without erythema or ulceration. These data indicate that topical small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting drivers of AK/SCCIS/cSCC growth represent a promising therapeutic approach to treat these common skin lesions.",Topical kinase inhibitors induce regression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

"BACKGROUND: Somatic overgrowth conditions, including Proteus syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum, are caused by post-zygotic pathogenic variants, result in segmental mosaicism, and give rise to neural, cutaneous and/or lipomatous overgrowth. These variants occur in growth-promoting pathways leading to cellular proliferation and expansion of tissues that arise from the affected cellular lineage. METHODS: We report on 80 serial patients evaluated for somatic overgrowth conditions in a diagnostic laboratory setting, including three prenatal patients. In total, 166 tissues from these 80 patients were subjected to targeted sequencing of an 8-gene panel capturing 10.2 kb of sequence containing known pathogenic variants associated with somatic overgrowth conditions. Deep next-generation sequencing was performed with the IonTorrent PGM platform at an average depth typically >5,000x. RESULTS: Likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants were identified in 36 individuals and variants of unknown significance in four. The overall molecular diagnostic yield was 45% but was highly influenced by both submitted tissue type and phenotype. In the prenatal setting, two patients had pathogenic variants identified in cultured amniocytes but in a third patient, the pathogenic variant was only present in post-natal tissues. Finally, expanding the test to include full gene sequencing of PIK3CA in contrast to targeted sequencing identified likely pathogenic variants in 3 of 7 patients that tested negative on the original panel. CONCLUSION: Next-generation sequencing has enabled sensitive detection of somatic pathogenic variants associated with overgrowth conditions. However, as the pathogenic variant allele frequency varies by tissue type within an individual, submission of affected tissue(s) greatly increases the chances of a molecular diagnosis.",Molecular diagnosis of somatic overgrowth conditions: A single-center experience.
"Data from mouse tumor models suggest that tumor-associated monocyte/macrophage lineage cells (MMLCs) dampen antitumor immune responses. However, given the fundamental differences between mice and humans in tumor evolution, genetic heterogeneity, and immunity, the function of MMLCs might be different in human tumors, especially during early stages of disease. Here, we studied MMLCs in early-stage human lung tumors and found that they consist of a mixture of classical tissue monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The TAMs coexpressed M1/M2 markers, as well as T cell coinhibitory and costimulatory receptors. Functionally, TAMs did not primarily suppress tumor-specific effector T cell responses, whereas tumor monocytes tended to be more T cell inhibitory. TAMs expressing relevant MHC class I/tumor peptide complexes were able to activate cognate effector T cells. Mechanistically, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on bystander TAMs, as opposed to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells, did not inhibit interactions between tumor-specific T cells and tumor targets. TAM-derived PD-L1 exerted a regulatory role only during the interaction of TAMs presenting relevant peptides with cognate effector T cells and thus may limit excessive activation of T cells and protect TAMs from killing by these T cells. These results suggest that the function of TAMs as primarily immunosuppressive cells might not fully apply to early-stage human lung cancer and might explain why some patients with strong PD-L1 positivity fail to respond to PD-L1 therapy.",Human tumor-associated monocytes/macrophages and their regulation of T cell responses in early-stage lung cancer.

"Reports suggesting that vitamin D may have extraskeletal roles have renewed interest in vitamin D research and stimulated publication of an increasing number of new studies each year. These studies typically assess vitamin D status by measuring the blood concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), the principal circulating metabolite of vitamin D. Unfortunately, variations in assay format, inconsistency in interpreting 25(OH)D concentrations, cohort bias (age, BMI, race, season of measurements etc.) and failure to measure critical variables needed to interpret study results, makes interpreting results and comparing studies difficult. Further, variation in reporting results (reporting mean values vs. percent of the cohort that is deficient, no clear statement as to clinical relevance of effect size, etc.) further limits interstudy analyses.

"OBJECTIVE: To understand trends in pediatric cases performed during urology residency including intraresident variability and cases performed relative to required minimums. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case logs of urology residents graduating from 2010 to 2018 were analyzed. Temporal trends in reported pediatric case volume were assessed via ANOVA tests and calculation of compound annual growth rates (CAGRs). Percent differences between the 90th and 10th percentiles of residents were calculated to assess intraresident variability. Reported case volumes were compared with minimum requirements with t tests. RESULTS: 1072 residents from 306 urology residency programs were represented in this study. Minor pediatric cases increased from 2010 to 2018 (105.4 +/- 54 vs 124.6 +/- 65, P=.004, CAGR=2.1%) while major pediatric cases decreased (83.9 +/- 40 vs 60.8 +/- 30, P < .001, CAGR=-3.9%). Orchiopexy (range, 23%-27%), hypospadias (range, 19%-21%), and hydrocele / hernia (range, 15%-19%) were the highest volume case categories. Mean intraresident variability in reported case volumes was 338% for minor pediatric (CAGR=0%) and 382% for major pediatric (CAGR=1.8%). Mean reported case volumes exceeded the minimum requirement for each case category by several fold (P < .001, range, percent difference 232-675%). All urology residents reported minimum pediatric case requirements in 2018. CONCLUSION: Urology residents report more cases than minimum requirements for pediatric urology by several folds. Future research is needed to understand the implications of increasing intraresident case volume variabilities on residency training in pediatric urology.",Disparities in Pediatric Operative Experience during Urology Residency Training.
"BACKGROUND: Human serum albumin (HSA) is a commonly used colloid for volume expansion and albumin replacement and during plasmapheresis. Colloids are an uncommon cause of anaphylaxis, and cases of hypersensitivity reactions to HSA are extremely rare. CASE REPORT: A 10-year-old boy with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was treated with plasmapheresis, with albumin as the replacement fluid. He developed a severe reaction characterized by respiratory, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous symptoms. RESULTS: Skin testing to HSA was positive and resulted in objective systemic symptoms, suggesting an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to HSA. CONCLUSION: While colloids are an uncommon cause of immediate hypersensitivity reactions, they can lead to severe and potentially fatal reactions if not recognized and treated promptly.",Immediate hypersensitivity reaction to human serum albumin in a child undergoing plasmapheresis.
"PURPOSE: Optical redox imaging (ORI), based on collecting the endogenous fluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and oxidized flavoproteins (Fp) containing a redox cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), provides sensitive indicators of cellular metabolism and redox status. ORI indices (such as NADH, FAD, and their ratio) have been under investigation as potential progression/prognosis biomarkers for cancer. Higher FAD redox ratio (i.e., FAD/(FAD + NADH)) has been associated with higher invasive/metastatic potential in tumor xenografts and cultured cells. This study is to examine whether ORI indices can respond to the modulation of oncogene DEK activities that change cancer cell invasive/metastatic potential. PROCEDURES: Using lentiviral shRNA, DEK gene expression was efficiently knocked down in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (DEKsh). These DEKsh cells, along with scrambled shRNA-transduced control cells (NTsh), were imaged with a fluorescence microscope. In vitro invasive potential of the DEKsh cells and NTsh cells was also measured in parallel using the transwell assay. RESULTS: FAD and FAD redox ratios in polyclonal cells with DEKsh were significantly lower than that in NTsh control cells. Consistently, the DEKsh cells demonstrated decreased invasive potential than their non-knockdown counterparts NTsh cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides direct evidence that oncogene activities could mediate ORI-detected cellular redox state.",Optical Redox Imaging Detects the Effects of DEK Oncogene Knockdown on the Redox State of MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells.
"OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a method for areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measurement based on dual-layer spectral CT scout scans. METHODS: A post-processing algorithm using a pair of 2D virtual mono-energetic scout images (VMSIs) was established in order to semi-automatically compute the aBMD at the spine similarly to DXA, using manual soft tissue segmentation, semi-automatic segmentation for the vertebrae, and automatic segmentation for the background. The method was assessed based on repetitive measurements of the standardized European Spine Phantom (ESP) using the standard scout scan tube current (30 mA) and other tube currents (10 to 200 mA), as well as using fat-equivalent extension rings simulating different patient habitus, and was compared to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Moreover, the feasibility of the method was assessed in vivo in female patients. RESULTS: Derived from standard scout scans, aBMD values measured with the proposed method significantly correlated with DXA measurements (r = 0.9925, p < 0.001), and mean accuracy (DXA, 4.12%; scout, 1.60%) and precision (DXA, 2.64%; scout, 2.03%) were comparable between the two methods. Moreover, aBMD values assessed at different tube currents did not differ significantly (p >/= 0.20 for all), suggesting that the presented method could be applied to scout scans with different settings. Finally, data derived from sample patients were concordant with BMD values from a reference age-matched population. CONCLUSIONS: Based on dual-layer spectral scout scans, aBMD measurements were fast and reliable and significantly correlated with the according DXA measurements in phantoms. Considering the number of CT acquisitions performed worldwide, this method could allow truly opportunistic osteoporosis screening. KEY POINTS: * 2D scout scans (localizer radiographs) from a dual-layer spectral CT scanner, which are mandatory parts of a CT examination, can be used to automatically determine areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the spine. * The presented method allowed fast (< 25 s/patient), semi-automatic, and reliable DXA-equivalent aBMD measurements for state-of-the-art DXA phantoms at different tube settings and for various patient habitus, as well as for sample patients. * Considering the number of CT scout scan acquisitions performed worldwide on a daily basis, the presented technique could enable truly opportunistic osteoporosis screening with DXA-equivalent metrics, without involving higher radiation exposure since it only processes existing data that is acquired during each CT scan.",DXA-equivalent quantification of bone mineral density using dual-layer spectral CT scout scans.

"Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARSs) link specific amino acids with their cognate transfer RNAs in a critical early step of protein translation. Mutations in ARSs have emerged as a cause of recessive, often complex neurological disease traits. Here we report an allelic series consisting of seven novel and two previously reported biallelic variants in valyl-tRNA synthetase (VARS) in ten patients with a developmental encephalopathy with microcephaly, often associated with early-onset epilepsy. In silico, in vitro, and yeast complementation assays demonstrate that the underlying pathomechanism of these mutations is most likely a loss of protein function. Zebrafish modeling accurately recapitulated some of the key neurological disease traits. These results provide both genetic and biological insights into neurodevelopmental disease and pave the way for further in-depth research on ARS related recessive disorders and precision therapies.",Biallelic VARS variants cause developmental encephalopathy with microcephaly that is recapitulated in vars knockout zebrafish.
"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis is controlled by cytokine receptor-mediated JAK2 signaling. We previously found that JAK2 is promptly ubiquitinated upon cytokine stimulation. Whether a competing JAK2 de-ubiquitination activity exists is unknown. LNK is an essential adaptor protein that constrains HSC expansion through dampening thrombopoietin (TPO)- induced JAK2 signaling. We show here that a LNK-associated lysine(63)- (K63-) deubiquitinating (DUB) complex, BRISC attenuates HSC expansion through control of JAK2 signaling. We pinpoint a direct interaction between the LNK SH2 domain and a phosphorylated tyrosine residue in KIAA0157 (Abraxas2), a unique and defining BRISC component. Kiaa0157 deficiency in mice led to an expansion of phenotypic and functional HSCs. Endogenous JAK2 and phospho-JAK2 were rapidly K63-ubiquitinated upon TPO stimulation, and this was augmented in cells depleted of BRISC core components KIAA0157, MERIT40, or BRCC36. This increase in JAK2 ubiquitinationn following BRISC knockdown was associated with increased TPO-mediated JAK2 activation and protein levels, and increased MPL receptor presence at the cell surface. Additionally, BRISC depletion promoted membrane-proximal association between the MPL receptor and pJAK2/JAK2, thus enhancing activated JAK2/MPL at the cell membrane. These findings define a novel pathway by which K63-ubiquitination promotes JAK2 stability and activation in a proteasome independent manner. Moreover. mutations in BRCC36 are found in clonal hematopoiesis in humans. This work may shed light into the mechanistic understanding of a potential role of BRCC36 in human HSCs.",The BRISC de-ubiquitinating enzyme complex limits hematopoietic stem cell expansion by regulating JAK2 K63-ubiquitination.
"Background Heart size and function in children with single right ventricle (RV) anomalies may be influenced by shunt type at the Norwood procedure. We sought to identify shunt-related differences during early childhood after staged surgical palliations using echocardiography. Methods We compared echocardiographic indices of RV, neoaortic, and tricuspid valve size and function at 14 months, pre-Fontan, and 6 years in 241 subjects randomized to a Norwood procedure using either the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or RV-to-pulmonary-artery shunt. Results At 6 years, the shunt groups did not differ significantly in any measure except for increased indexed neoaortic area in the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. RV ejection fraction improved between pre-Fontan and 6 years in the RV-to-pulmonary artery shunt group but was stable in the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt group. For the entire cohort, RV diastolic and systolic size and functional indices were improved at 6 years compared with earlier measurements, and indexed tricuspid and neoaortic annular area decreased from 14 months to 6 years. The prevalence of >/=moderate tricuspid and neoaortic regurgitation was uncommon and did not vary by group or time period. Diminished RV ejection fraction at the 14-month study was predictive of late death/transplant; the hazard of late death/transplant when RV ejection fraction was <40% was tripled (hazard ratio, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.41-7.17). Conclusions By 6 years after staged palliation, shunt type has not impacted RV size and function, and RV and valvar size and function show beneficial remodeling. Poor RV systolic function at 14 months predicts worse late survival independent of the initial shunt type. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

"Our understanding of the human mutation rate helps us build evolutionary models and interpret patterns of genetic variation observed in human populations. Recent work indicates that the frequencies of specific polymorphism types have been elevated in Europe, and that many more, subtler signatures of global polymorphism variation may yet remain unidentified. Here, we present an analysis of the 1,000 Genomes Project supported by analysis in the Simons Genome Diversity Panel, suggesting additional putative signatures of mutation rate variation across populations and the extent to which they are shaped by local sequence context. First, we compiled a list of the most significantly variable polymorphism types in a cross-continental statistical test. Clustering polymorphisms together, we observe three sets that showed distinct shared patterns of relative enrichment among ancestral populations, and we characterize each one of these putative 'signatures' of polymorphism variation. For three of these signatures, we found that a single flanking base pair of sequence context was sufficient to determine the majority of enrichment or depletion of a polymorphism type. However, local genetic context up to 2-3 base pairs away contributes additional variability and may help to interpret a previously noted enrichment of certain polymorphism types in some East Asian groups. Moreover, considering broader local genetic context highlights patterns of polymorphism variation which were not captured by previous approaches. Building our understanding of mutation rate in this way can help us to construct more accurate evolutionary models and better understand the mechanisms that underlie genetic change.",Signals of variation in human mutation rate at multiple levels of sequence context.
"Concerns about vaccine safety can lead to decreased acceptance of vaccines and resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases. We summarize the key evidence on some of the main current vaccine safety controversies in the United States, including: 1) MMR vaccine and autism; 2) thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative, and the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders; 3) vaccine-induced Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS); 4) vaccine-induced autoimmune diseases; 5) safety of HPV vaccine; 6) aluminum adjuvant-induced autoimmune diseases and other disorders; and 7) too many vaccines given early in life predisposing children to health and developmental problems. A possible small increased risk of GBS following influenza vaccination has been identified, but the magnitude of the increase is less than the risk of GBS following influenza infection. Otherwise, the biological and epidemiologic evidence does not support any of the reviewed vaccine safety concerns.",Principal Controversies in Vaccine Safety in the United States.

"Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality following allotransplant. Activated donor effector T cells can differentiate into pathogenic T helper (Th)-17 cells and germinal center (GC)-promoting T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, resulting in cGVHD. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase-delta (PI3Kdelta), a lipid kinase, is critical for activated T cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. We demonstrate PI3Kdelta activity in donor T cells that become Tfh cells is required for cGVHD in a nonsclerodermatous multiorgan system disease model that includes bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), dependent upon GC B cells, Tfhs, and counterbalanced by T follicular regulatory cells, each requiring PI3Kdelta signaling for function and survival. Although B cells rely on PI3Kdelta pathway signaling and GC formation is disrupted resulting in a substantial decrease in Ig production, PI3Kdelta kinase-dead mutant donor bone marrow-derived GC B cells still supported BO cGVHD generation. A PI3Kdelta-specific inhibitor, compound GS-649443, that has superior potency to idelalisib while maintaining selectivity, reduced cGVHD in mice with active disease. In a Th1-dependent and Th17-associated scleroderma model, GS-649443 effectively treated mice with active cGVHD. These data provide a foundation for clinical trials of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved PI3Kdelta inhibitors for cGVHD therapy in patients.",Targeting PI3Kdelta function for amelioration of murine chronic graft-versus-host disease.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Weight loss is strongly associated with improvement in blood pressure; however, the mechanism of weight loss can impact the magnitude and sustainability of blood pressure reduction. RECENT FINDINGS: Five drugs-orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine/topiramate, and naltrexone/bupropion-are currently approved for weight loss therapy in the USA. Naltrexone/bupropion results in an increase in in-office and ambulatory blood pressure compared to placebo. Other therapies are associated with modest lowering of blood pressure, and are generally well-tolerated; nonetheless, evidence is limited regarding their effect on blood pressure, particularly longitudinally, in individuals with hypertension. Although weight loss medications can be an effective adjunct to lifestyle modifications in individuals with obesity, there is limited evidence regarding their benefit with regard to blood pressure. Future studies evaluating the effectiveness of weight loss medications should include careful assessment of their short- and long-term impact on blood pressure in individuals with hypertension.",Weight Loss Medications in the Treatment of Obesity and Hypertension.
"Background: This study evaluated the hemoglobin dose response, other efficacy measures and safety of daprodustat, an orally administered, hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor in development for anemia of chronic kidney disease. Methods: Participants (n = 216) with baseline hemoglobin levels of 9-11.5 g/dL on hemodialysis (HD) previously receiving stable doses of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) were randomized in a 24-week dose-range, efficacy and safety study. Participants discontinued rhEPO and then were randomized to receive daily daprodustat (4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 mg) or control (placebo for 4 weeks then open-label rhEPO as required). After 4 weeks, doses were titrated to achieve a hemoglobin target of 10-11.5 g/dL. The primary outcome was characterization of the dose-response relationship between daprodustat and hemoglobin at 4 weeks; additionally, the efficacy and safety of daprodustat were assessed over 24 weeks. Results: Over the first 4 weeks, the mean hemoglobin change from baseline increased dose-dependently from -0.29 (daprodustat 4 mg) to 0.69 g/dL (daprodustat 10 and 12 mg). The mean change from baseline hemoglobin (10.4 g/dL) at 24 weeks was 0.03 and -0.11 g/dL for the combined daprodustat and control groups, respectively. The median maximum observed plasma EPO levels in the control group were approximately 14-fold higher than in the combined daprodustat group. Daprodustat demonstrated an adverse event profile consistent with the HD population. Conclusions: Daprodustat produced dose-dependent changes in hemoglobin over the first 4 weeks after switching from a stable dose of rhEPO as well as maintained hemoglobin target levels over 24 weeks.","Daprodustat for anemia: a 24-week, open-label, randomized controlled trial in participants on hemodialysis."
"Background: Angiopoietin-1 and -2 are vascular growth factors that exert opposing effects on endothelial activation and dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess the association of these biomarkers with outcomes in children with sepsis. Methods: Biomarkers were assayed from the blood collected in an emergency department prior to any intervention. Predictor variables were Ang-1 and Ang-2 levels and the Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio. Outcomes included mortality, length of time on vasopressors, and ICU and hospital lengths of stay. The Pediatric RISk of Mortality III Score was calculated. A vasoactive inotrope score was calculated every 12 hours. Results: Forty-five children with sepsis and 49 with septic shock were analyzed. The median Ang-2 was higher in septic shock. The Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio was approximately 2-fold greater in those with septic shock. The Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio was associated with higher doses of vasoactive agents at 12 hours and longer ICU length of stay. In septic shock, for every 0.35 unit increase in the Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio, the PRISM III score increased by 1. Conclusions: The Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio was higher in children with septic shock. Ang-2/Ang-1 was associated with higher vasoactive agents, longer ICU length of stay, and correlated with the severity of illness score.",Systemic Angiopoietin-1/2 Dysregulation in Pediatric Sepsis and Septic Shock.
"BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and -II play an important role in prenatal growth. During the first 2 months from birth, body fat doubles, and rapid weight gain during this time increases future risk of cardiometabolic disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether IGF measurements at birth associate with body composition and the trajectory of its changes in the first 2 months. METHODS: Umbilical cord IGF-I and -II concentrations were measured in term infants. Air displacement plethysmography was performed at birth and 2 months. Fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were corrected for infant length (L) to FM/L(3) and FFM/L(2), respectively. RESULTS: In 601 (317 male) infants, IGF-I concentrations at birth were associated with FM/L(3) and FFM/L(2) Z-scores at birth (R(2) = 0.05 and 0.04, respectively, P < 0.001), and IGF-II concentrations were associated with FFM/L(2) Z-scores at birth (R(2) = 0.01, P = 0.02). Lower IGF-I concentrations were weakly associated with increases in FM/L(3) Z-scores over the first 2 months (R(2) = 0.01, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: IGF-I concentrations at birth are associated with adiposity and lean mass at birth and inversely with the trajectory of FM accumulation over the first 2 months. IGF-I measurements only account for a small amount of the variance in these measures.",The relationship between IGF-I and -II concentrations and body composition at birth and over the first 2 months.
"Chromatin loops enable transcription-factor-bound distal enhancers to interact with their target promoters to regulate transcriptional programs. Although developmental transcription factors such as active forms of Notch can directly stimulate transcription by activating enhancers, the effect of their oncogenic subversion on the 3D organization of cancer genomes is largely undetermined. By mapping chromatin looping genome-wide in Notch-dependent triple-negative breast cancer and B cell lymphoma, we show that beyond the well-characterized role of Notch as an activator of distal enhancers, Notch regulates its direct target genes by instructing enhancer repositioning. Moreover, a large fraction of Notch-instructed regulatory loops form highly interacting enhancer and promoter spatial clusters termed ""3D cliques."" Loss- and gain-of-function experiments show that Notch preferentially targets hyperconnected 3D cliques that regulate the expression of crucial proto-oncogenes. Our observations suggest that oncogenic hijacking of developmental transcription factors can dysregulate transcription through widespread effects on the spatial organization of cancer genomes.",Oncogenic Notch Promotes Long-Range Regulatory Interactions within Hyperconnected 3D Cliques.
"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting females, with over 260,000 new cases annually and over 3.1 million survivors in the United States alone. Exposure to potentially cardiotoxic therapies, including anthracyclines, trastuzumab, and radiation therapy, coupled with host factors, place patients at increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to non-cancer controls. Overall survival outcomes are significantly worse in patients who develop CVD, and in certain breast cancer populations, cardiovascular death exceeds the risk of cancer death in the long-term. In order to mitigate the risk of CVD, there is a growing interest in the use of cardioprotective strategies at the time of cancer therapy initiation. In this review, we present a detailed evaluation of the evidence from recently completed as well as ongoing cardio-oncology clinical trials in pharmacologic cardioprotection in breast cancer patients. We focus primarily on the potential role of dexrazoxane, alterations in anthracycline dosing or formulation, neurohormonal antagonists, beta-blockers, and combination therapy. We also discuss ongoing studies in statin cardioprotection, radiation delivery strategies, use of risk-guided strategies and the study of specific cancer populations.

"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Hospital acquired venous thromboembolism in children is associated with significant morbidity/mortality. Prevention strategies include sequential compression devices and prophylactic anticoagulation but these interventions carry risk and are poorly studied in children. Objectives were to evaluate primary thromboprophylaxis use in hospitalized children over time and the associated bleeding risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of hospitalized patients aged 10-18years within the Pediatric Health Information System administrative database from January 2008-September 2015. Factors associated with thromboprophylaxis receipt and bleeding were identified using generalized linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: Of 1,075,383 hospitalizations, 10,544 (1%) received prophylactic enoxaparin and 58,768 (5%) received mechanical compression. Mechanical thromboprophylaxis increased slightly over time (4.3% in 2008, 6.2% in 2015), enoxaparin use did not (0.8% in 2008, 1.2% in 2015). Patients aged 16-18 were more likely than younger children (10-12) to receive pharmacologic (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9-3.3) or mechanical thromboprophylaxis (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 2.9-3). Patients on rehabilitation medical service were more likely to receive prophylactic enoxaparin (aOR 53, 95% CI 44.1-64.5). 5.6% (589/10,544) of patients receiving enoxaparin prophylaxis had bleeding. Thromboprophylaxis use by hospital varied with a range of 0.25-3.3% for enoxaparin and 2-26.2% for mechanical compression. CONCLUSION: Thromboprophylaxis is infrequently utilized in hospitalized children. Pharmacologic prophylaxis with enoxaparin remains low and has not substantially increased over time. Significant variability exists across hospitals and services in the administration of both mechanical and pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis highlighting the need for further evidence to standardize practice.",Primary thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized children: A multi-center retrospective analysis.
"The cardiovascular biology of proton radiotherapy is not well understood. We aimed to compare the genomic dose-response to proton and gamma radiation of the mouse aorta to assess whether their vascular effects may diverge. We performed comparative RNA sequencing of the aorta following (4 hrs) total-body proton and gamma irradiation (0.5-200 cGy whole body dose, 10 dose levels) of conscious mice. A trend analysis identified genes that showed a dose response. While fewer genes were dose-responsive to proton than gamma radiation (29 vs. 194 genes; q-value </= 0.1), the magnitude of the effect was greater. Highly responsive genes were enriched for radiation response pathways (DNA damage, apoptosis, cellular stress and inflammation; p-value </= 0.01). Gamma, but not proton radiation induced additionally genes in vasculature specific pathways. Genes responsive to both radiation types showed almost perfectly superimposable dose-response relationships. Despite the activation of canonical radiation response pathways by both radiation types, we detected marked differences in the genomic response of the murine aorta. Models of cardiovascular risk based on photon radiation may not accurately predict the risk associated with proton radiation.",Distinct vascular genomic response of proton and gamma radiation-A pilot investigation.
"INTRODUCTION: Home hemodialysis (HHD) is an under-utilized renal replacement modality in the United States in part because of high rates of discontinuation and transfer to in-center hemodialysis. Understanding, from the perspective of patients, facilitators, and barriers to sustained use of HHD is important for increasing successful use of this modality. METHODS: We conducted 25 semistructured interviews with 15 current and 10 former adult patients treated with home hemodialysis (23 short daily HHD and 2 nocturnal HHD). Interview transcripts were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. FINDINGS: Five themes related to continuation or discontinuation of HHD emerged: (1) degree of independence (increased flexibility, burden of therapy), (2) availability of support (emotional and physical support and caregiver burden), (3) technical aspects (familiarity with machine), (4) home environment (ability to organize supplies, space in home), and (5) attitude and expectations (positive or negative outlook about performing HHD). For each theme, positive aspects facilitated continuation of HHD and negative aspects contributed to discontinuation of HHD. DISCUSSION: HHD can be burdensome to patients and family members, and some discontinuations may be preventable. Helping patients with scheduling and organization, improving communication about expectations and trouble-shooting, supporting patients as well as family members, adapting the dialysis prescription to the patient's lifestyle when possible, and providing respite when needed may make HHD more sustainable for patients.",The home hemodialysis patient experience: A qualitative assessment of modality use and discontinuation.
"Cells in tissues in vivo face a very different microenvironment than typical cultured cells plated on a plastic dish. Already several decades ago, cell biologists observed that cell lines show dramatically different morphology and growth characteristics when embedded into three-dimensional (3D) substrates or standard tissue culture plates (Montesano R, Schaller G, Orci L, Cell. 66:697-711, 1991; Barcellos-Hoff MH, Aggeler J, Ram TG, Bissell MJ, Development. 105:223-235, 1989; Simian M, Bissell MJ, J Cell Biol. 216:31-40, 2017). Despite its imminent benefit for cell biological studies, suspicion and prejudice toward more complicated sample preparation requirements limited the popularity of 3D culture techniques until recently, when it was shown that soft 3D gels made of basement membrane extracts (BME) allow prolonged culture of many types of primary epithelial cells (Clevers H, Cell. 165:1586-1597, 2016; Sato T, Vries RG, Snippert HJ, van de Wetering M, Barker N, Stange DE, et al., Nature. 459:262-265, 2009).

"OBJECTIVE: Simulation technology provides a safe environment to learn crisis resource management in stressful clinical scenarios, such as the acute airway. While a number of surgical simulation studies have assessed trainees, there remains a paucity of data on simulation benefits for practicing physicians. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of a simulation symposium on airway management for practicing otolaryngologists. METHODS: Questionnaires (5-point Likert and open-answer questions) and interviews were distributed and conducted at a simulation symposium on airway management held at an annual meeting. RESULTS: The majority of participants had no prior experience in simulation (62.5%). The data suggested a strong increase in comfort with airway management scenarios (2.93 to 4.09 (p&lt;0.001)). Participants reported the symposium as relevant (4.68) and useful (4.67), with increased confidence about their knowledge of crisis resource management and team training (4.53). Qualitative data suggested great educational value for technical skills and communication strategies. CONCLUSION: Simulation with feedback may provide an opportunity for the practicing otolaryngologist to fulfill Continuing Medical Education and Professional Development requirements. This symposium allowed practicing otolaryngologists, including those in the community, to learn, develop, and refresh technical and communication skills while fulfilling certification requirements.",Using Simulation Technology to Improve Patient Safety in Airway Management by Practicing Otolaryngologists.

Most phenotypic manifestations are multi-systemic, with presentations varying at different age of onset and may show great variability within members of the same family; making these truly complex IEMs. Most primary mitochondrial diseases are autosomal recessive (AR); but maternally-inherited [from mitochondrial (mt) DNA], autosomal dominant and X-linked inheritance are also known. Mitochondria are unique energy-generating cellular organelles, geared for survival and contain their own unique genetic coding material, a circular piece of mtDNA about 16,000 base pairs in size. Additional nuclear (n)DNA encoded genes maintain mitochondrial biogenesis by supervising mtDNA replication, repair and synthesis, which is modified during increased energy demands or physiological stress. Despite our growing knowledge of the hundreds of genetic etiologies for this group of disorders, diagnosis can also remain elusive due to unique aspects of mitochondrial genetics. Though cure and FDA-approved therapies currently elude these IEMs, and current suggested therapies which include nutritional supplements and vitamins are of questionable efficacy; multi-center, international clinical trials are in progress for primary mitochondrial disorders.",Mitochondrial disorders.
"Insulin resistance is associated with numerous metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type II diabetes, that currently plague our society. Although insulin normally promotes anabolic metabolism in the liver by increasing glucose consumption and lipid synthesis, insulin-resistant individuals fail to inhibit hepatic glucose production and paradoxically have increased liver lipid synthesis, leading to hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Here, we detail the intrahepatic and extrahepatic pathways mediating insulin's control of glucose and lipid metabolism. We propose that the interplay between both of these pathways controls insulin signaling and that mis-regulation between the 2 results in the paradoxic effects seen in the insulin-resistant liver instead of the commonly proposed deficiencies in particular branches of only the direct hepatic pathway.",Resolving the Paradox of Hepatic Insulin Resistance.
"Somatic mutations have been identified in aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) in genes that include KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, and CACNA1D. Based on independent studies, there appears to be racial differences in the prevalence of somatic KCNJ5 mutations, particularly between East Asians and Europeans. Despite the high cardiovascular disease mortality of blacks, there have been no studies focusing on somatic mutations in APAs in this population. In the present study, we investigated genetic characteristics of APAs in blacks using a CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) immunohistochemistry-guided next-generation sequencing approach. The adrenal glands with adrenocortical adenomas from 79 black patients with primary aldosteronism were studied. Seventy-three tumors from 69 adrenal glands were confirmed to be APAs by CYP11B2 immunohistochemistry. Sixty-five of 73 APAs (89%) had somatic mutations in aldosterone-driver genes. Somatic CACNA1D mutations were the most prevalent genetic alteration (42%), followed by KCNJ5 (34%), ATP1A1 (8%), and ATP2B3 mutations (4%). CACNA1D mutations were more often observed in APAs from males than those from females (55% versus 29%, P=0.033), whereas KCNJ5 mutations were more prevalent in APAs from females compared with those from males (57% versus 13%, P<0.001). No somatic mutations in aldosterone-driver genes were identified in tumors without CYP11B2 expression. In conclusion, 89% of APAs in blacks harbor aldosterone-driving mutations, and unlike Europeans and East Asians, the most frequently mutated aldosterone-driver gene was CACNA1D. Determination of racial differences in the prevalence of aldosterone-driver gene mutations may facilitate the development of personalized medicines for patients with primary aldosteronism.",Genetic Characteristics of Aldosterone-Producing Adenomas in Blacks.

"Previous work suggests that, compared to white adults, black adults have lower perceived risk for smoking-related diseases (SRDs), which may influence cessation behavior and health outcomes; however, racial differences in SRD risk perceptions among high-risk patients (i.e., a group that exhibits elevated risk for SRDs) following lung screening remain unknown. This paper thus examined differences in risk perceptions for lung cancer and other SRDs among black and white National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) participants. We administered a 10-item measure of perceived lifetime risk of lung cancer and other SRD (Smoking Risk Perceptions Scale; SRPS) to NLST participants at 1 year following lung screening to (1) establish the internal consistency of the SRPS for both black and white participants, (2) compare smoking-related disease risk perceptions between black and white participants, and (3) identify predictors of risk perceptions for black and white participants using multivariable linear regression models. We determined the SRPS items loaded onto two factors (personal and comparative risks; Cronbach's alpha = 0.93 and 0.95 for 1743 white and 194 black participants, respectively), thus demonstrating high internal consistency for both black and white adults. Compared to white participants, black adults demonstrated lower SRD risk perceptions (SRPS range = 10-50, mean difference = 2.55, SE = 0.50, p < 0.001), even after adjusting for smoking status and sociodemographics. Younger age, female gender, higher education, white race, and current smoking status were independently associated with high risk perceptions. Sociodemographic factors associated with lower risk perceptions resemble factors related to continued smoking. Findings suggest current and former black smokers are at risk of having lower risk perceptions for lung cancer and SRDs than white adults following lung cancer screening; these differences may explain observed racial differences in cessation outcomes. Although similar factors influence black and white adults' beliefs, risk perceptions may differentially impact smoking behavior among these groups. Behavior change models that guide tobacco treatment approaches, particularly for high-risk black smokers, should consider the influence of cultural factors on risk perceptions and cessation efforts.",Racial Differences in Smoking-related Disease Risk Perceptions Among Adults Completing Lung Cancer Screening: Follow-up Results from the ACRIN/NLST Ancillary Study.
"Proteomic characterization of isolated organelles can provide insight into the functional components of the structure and novel targets for further testing. Germplasm in developing oocytes is difficult to isolate for protein identification because not all types of germplasm are stable outside of the cytoplasm. In zebrafish, the Balbiani body forms a proteinaceous aggregate that contains the germplasm and we found is stable outside of the oocyte. Here we present a manual isolation protocol that collects intact Balbiani bodies from stage I zebrafish oocytes. We lysed oocytes by passing them through a syringe, and then used a fine injection needle to wick up Balbiani bodies by capillary action with minimal buffer solution. Using this protocol we collected sufficient material for proteomic analysis of the zebrafish Balbiani body.",Isolation of Zebrafish Balbiani Bodies for Proteomic Analysis.
"Few studies have examined the incremental validity of multi-informant depression screening approaches. In response, we examined how recommendations for using a multi-informant approach may vary for identifying concurrent or prospective depressive episodes. Participants included 663 youth (AgeM = 11.83; AgeSD = 2.40) and their caregiver who independently completed youth depression questionnaires, and clinical diagnostic interviews, every 6 months for 3 years. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses showed that youth-report best predicted concurrent episodes, and that both youth and parent-report were necessary to adequately forecast prospective episodes. More specifically, youth-reported negative mood symptoms and parent-reported anhedonic symptoms incrementally predicted future depressive episodes. Findings were invariant to youth's sex and age, and results from person and variable-centered analyses suggested that discrepancies between informants were not clinically meaningful. Implications for future research and evidence-based decision making for depression screening initiatives are discussed.",Youth Depression Screening with Parent and Self-Reports: Assessing Current and Prospective Depression Risk.
"Cancer cells frequently boost nucleotide metabolism (NM) to support their increased proliferation, but the consequences of elevated NM on tumor de-differentiation are mostly unexplored. Here, we identified a role for thymidylate synthase (TS), a NM enzyme and established drug target, in cancer cell de-differentiation and investigated its clinical significance in breast cancer (BC). In vitro, TS knockdown increased the population of CD24(+) differentiated cells, and attenuated migration and sphere-formation. RNA-seq profiling indicated repression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature genes upon TS knockdown, and TS-deficient cells showed an increased ability to invade and metastasize in vivo, consistent with the occurrence of a partial EMT phenotype. Mechanistically, TS enzymatic activity was found essential for maintenance of the EMT/stem-like state by fueling a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase-dependent pyrimidine catabolism. In patient tissues, TS levels were found significantly higher in poorly differentiated and in triple negative BC, and strongly correlated with worse prognosis. The present study provides the rationale to study in-depth the role of NM at the crossroads of proliferation and differentiation, and depicts new avenues for the design of novel drug combinations for the treatment of BC.",Thymidylate synthase maintains the de-differentiated state of triple negative breast cancers.
"Proper chromosome segregation depends upon kinetochore phosphorylation by the Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC). Current models suggest the activity of the CPC decreases in response to the inter-kinetochore stretch that accompanies the formation of bi-oriented microtubule attachments, however little is known about tension-independent CPC phosphoregulation. Microtubule bundles initially lie in close proximity to inner centromeres and become depleted by metaphase. Here we find these microtubules control kinetochore phosphorylation by the CPC in a tension independent manner via a microtubule-binding site on the Borealin subunit. Disruption of Borealin-microtubule interactions generates reduced phosphorylation of prometaphase kinetochores, improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments and weakened spindle checkpoint signals. Experimental and modeling evidence suggests that kinetochore phosphorylation is greatly stimulated when the CPC binds microtubules that lie near the inner centromere, even if kinetochores have high inter-kinetochore stretch. We propose the CPC senses its local environment through microtubule structures to control phosphorylation of kinetochores.",The binding of Borealin to microtubules underlies a tension independent kinetochore-microtubule error correction pathway.
"BACKGROUND: Of 37 pediatric rheumatology fellowship training programs in the United States, many have three or fewer fellows at a given time, making large-scale assessment of fellow performance difficult. An objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is a scenario-based simulation method that assesses individual performance, thus indirectly measuring training program effectiveness. This study describes the development and implementation of two national pediatric rheumatology OSCEs and methods used for programmatic improvement. METHODS: OSCEs for pediatric rheumatology fellows were held in 2009 and 2011 during national rheumatology meetings using scenarios and assessment forms originally developed by a fellowship program director. The seven scenarios tested medical knowledge, physical exam and interpersonal skills. Pediatric rheumatologist evaluators assessed fellows' performance using checklists and gave immediate feedback. Program directors were sent summaries of their fellows' performances. Fellows evaluated the OSCE, providing organizational and scenario improvement suggestions. Programmatic changes to the 2011 OSCE were based on 2009 performance data and program evaluation feedback. RESULTS: Twenty-two fellows participated in 2009 and 19 in 2011. Performance scores in similar scenarios did not change considerably over the two iterations. In 2009, 85.7% of participants reported desire to change clinical behavior. Assessors' 2009 program evaluation data prompted changes in rating scales and removal of invalid or unreliable assessments. Negative evaluation data about individual stations decreased from 60% in 2009 to 15.4% in 2011. Fellows' ratings of the experience's overall value were similar in 2009 and 2011. The average experience ratings were lower among fellows who proposed scenario-specific improvements and higher among those who recommended organizational improvements. CONCLUSIONS: The 2011 examination exhibited programmatic improvement via reduction in fellows' scenario-specific negative feedback. Fellows' overall satisfaction did not change. Further work in scenario selection, assessment validation and inter-rater reliability will improve future pediatric rheumatology OSCEs.",The pediatric rheumatology objective structured clinical examination: progressing from a homegrown effort toward a reliable and valid national formative assessment.
"Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a common pediatric epilepsy syndrome with distinct seizure semiology, electroencephalography (EEG) features, and treatment. A diagnosis of CAE can be obtained during an office visit with a careful history, physical exam including prolonged hyperventilation, and a routine EEG. The treatment of choice for CAE with absence seizures only is ethosuximide. Valproic acid and lamotrigine are also effective treatments for many patients, but when compared to ethosuximide, valproic acid has more adverse effects and lamotrigine is less effective. Attention to predictors of response to treatment, including clinical, electrographic, and genetic factors, is increasing. Refractory CAE occurs in fewer than half of patients, and treatment strategies are available, though efficacy data are lacking. Careful assessment and treatment of psychosocial comorbidities is essential in caring for patients with CAE.",A Practical Guide to Treatment of Childhood Absence Epilepsy.
"BACKGROUND: There exists a need for an adjustable socket to accommodate residual limb volume and shape changes. Further, limb loss rates globally are rising and there is a large unmet need for affordable and accessible prosthetic systems. OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of an immediate fit modular prosthetic system (IFIT Prosthetics, LLC((R)) ). DESIGN: Prospective feasibility study involving a two-week single-group pre-post intervention study. SETTING: PM&R gait laboratory PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were at least 6-months post amputation and walking with a conventional prosthesis. They were free of skin wounds, other neurological disorders, and severe pain conditions. METHODS: Participants were fit with an immediate fit prosthesis and instructed to wear it for a two-week evaluation period. They were given a progressive wearing schedule and they completed outcome measurements at the two week follow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported satisfaction, ii) gait biomechanics, and iii) intrasocket peak pressures. RESULTS: Twenty-six participants entered the study, with twenty-two completing the single group pre-post study. Subjects averaged 50 years (SD &pm;10.2) of age; four were female. Sixteen were dysvascular and ten were traumatic in etiology. Significant differences (p= .03) in self-reported satisfaction was found in favor of the IFIT device 29.33 (SD &pm; 4.51) versus the conventional device 25.52 (SD &pm; 6.8). No falls or limb ischemia were reported. Gait biomechanics revealed no differences across any temporal characteristics. Intra-socket peak pressures were significantly lower for the IFIT prostheses overall (p = .0014), at the anterior tibia (p=.0002), and the lateral side of the residual limb (p=.013). CONCLUSIONS: The IFIT transtibial prosthetic system appears to be safe in this short term single group pre-post study. This study provided preliminary evidence to support the feasibility of the IFIT system. It compared favorably to subjects' conventional prostheses across all outcome measures. With its cost, adjustability, and accessibility advantages, this device may prove useful for persons with transtibial amputations. A larger multi-center study is needed to confirm these results.

"PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that antagonizes the PI3K/AKT pathway and is recognized as a major dose-dependent tumor suppressor. The cellular mechanisms that control PTEN levels therefore offer potential routes to therapy, but these are as yet poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that PTEN plays an unexpected role in regulating its own stability through the transcriptional upregulation of the deubiquitinase USP11 by the PI3K/FOXO pathway, and further show that this feedforward mechanism is implicated in its tumor-suppressive role, as mice lacking Usp11 display increased susceptibility to PTEN-dependent tumor initiation, growth and metastasis. Notably, USP11 is downregulated in cancer patients, and correlates with PTEN expression and FOXO nuclear localization. Our findings therefore demonstrate that PTEN-PI3K-FOXO-USP11 constitute the regulatory feedforward loop that improves the stability and tumor suppressive activity of PTEN.",PTEN self-regulates through USP11 via the PI3K-FOXO pathway to stabilize tumor suppression.
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Data are scarce on blood metabolite associations with proteinuria, a strong risk factor for adverse kidney outcomes. We sought to investigate associations of proteinuria with serum metabolites identified using untargeted profiling in populations with CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using stored serum samples from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK; n=962) and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study (n=620), two rigorously conducted clinical trials with per-protocol measures of 24-hour proteinuria and GFR, we evaluated cross-sectional associations between urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and 637 known, nondrug metabolites, adjusting for key clinical covariables. Metabolites significantly associated with proteinuria were tested for associations with CKD progression. RESULTS: In the AASK and the MDRD study, respectively, the median urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 80 (interquartile range [IQR], 28-359) and 188 (IQR, 54-894) mg/g, mean age was 56 and 52 years, 39% and 38% were women, 100% and 7% were black, and median measured GFR was 48 (IQR, 35-57) and 28 (IQR, 18-39) ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Linear regression identified 66 serum metabolites associated with proteinuria in one or both studies after Bonferroni correction (P<7.8x10(-5)), 58 of which were statistically significant in a meta-analysis (P<7.8x10(-4)). The metabolites with the lowest P values (P<10(-27)) were 4-hydroxychlorthalonil and 1,5-anhydroglucitol; all six quantified metabolites in the phosphatidylethanolamine pathway were also significant. Of the 58 metabolites associated with proteinuria, four were associated with ESKD in both the AASK and the MDRD study. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 58 serum metabolites with cross-sectional associations with proteinuria, some of which were also associated with CKD progression.

"PURPOSE: The results of spinal accessory to suprascapular nerve transfers have been less reliable than other nerve transfers in the upper limb, possibly owing to compression of the nerve by the suprascapular ligament. The posterior approach has been advocated to allow for release of the ligament. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a ligament release is possible from the anterior approach. METHODS: Nine fresh-frozen cadavers were dissected to determine whether the ligament could be approached and released from the anterior approach. Complete ligament release was demonstrated by subluxation of the nerve out of the suprascapular notch. RESULTS: Ligament release was achieved in all specimens, although in one, confirmation of complete release required a posterior approach. CONCLUSIONS: Release of the suprascapular ligament to eliminate a potential source of compression of the suprascapular nerve during spinal accessory to suprascapular nerve transfer is possible through an anterior approach. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Release of the suprascapular ligament through an anterior approach allows this procedure to be performed through the same approach as brachial plexus exploration and spinal accessory nerve to suprascapular nerve transfer. This method could reduce surgical time and patient repositioning and avoid additional incisions.",Suprascapular Ligament Release From an Anterior Approach: An Anatomic Feasibility Study.
"PURPOSE: The goals of this study were 2-fold: (1) to determine the risk factors for cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) after implementation of a comprehensive surgical and anesthetic protocol consisting of patient risk stratification, maintenance of normotensive anesthesia, and patient positioning in a staged fashion, and (2) to assess for subclinical neurologic decline associated with intraoperative ischemic events through cognitive testing. METHODS: One hundred patients undergoing shoulder surgery in the beach chair position were stratified for risk of CDE based on Framingham stroke criteria, body mass index (BMI), and history of cerebrovascular accidents. Cerebral oxygen saturation was monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy. As per a standardized protocol, mean arterial pressure was maintained between 70 and 90 mm Hg. The head was raised in 2 stages separated by 3 minutes. CDE were defined as >20% drop from baseline or <55% O2 absolute threshold. Patients completed a Mini-Mental State Examination during preoperative examination and at the first postoperative visit. RESULTS: The CDE rate was 4% overall and 4.3% in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Forty-five patients were in the higher risk category, and all CDEs occurred in that group. Patients with a Framingham score >/= 10 or BMI >/= 35 who underwent general anesthesia had an increased risk of CDE (P = .04). No significant change was noted in Mini-Mental State Examination scores between pre- and postoperative visits. No correlation was shown between CDE and history of diabetes, smoking, cardiovascular disease, or left ventricular hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Our observed CDE rate was lower than previously reported rates, likely because of risk stratification, staged positioning, and normotensive anesthesia. Framingham score >/= 10 and BMI >/= 35 are risk factors for CDE in the beach chair position.

"BACKGROUND: A small percentage of patients relies extensively on hospital-based care and account for a disproportionately high share of health care spending in the United States. Evidence shows that behavioral health conditions are common among these individuals, but understanding of their behavioral health needs is limited. This study aimed to understand the behavioral health characteristics and needs of patients with high hospital utilization patterns in Camden, New Jersey. METHODS: The sample consisted of patients in a care management intervention for individuals with patterns of high hospital utilization who were referred for behavioral health assessments (N = 195). A clinical psychologist conducted the assessments, which informed a multiaxial evaluation with diagnostic criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and a Mental Status Examination, to facilitate accurate diagnosis. Demographic characteristics, housing instability, exposure to trauma, and health care service utilization data were also collected through self-report and chart reviews. RESULTS: Ninety percent of patients were diagnosed with a psychiatric and/or active substance use disorder. Depression was the most common psychiatric disorder and alcohol use was the most common substance use disorder. However, only 10% of patients with an active substance use disorder were in treatment, and only 17% of patients with a mental health diagnosis were receiving mental health treatment. Nearly all (91%) patients reported having a primary care provider at the time of assessment and most had seen their primary care provider within three months of their last hospital discharge. Non-medical barriers to health and wellness, specifically housing instability and exposure to trauma, were also common (35 and 61% of patients, respectively) among patients. CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the importance of identifying and treating patients with behavioral health needs in the primary care setting. Developing connections with community agencies who provide behavioral health and substance use treatment can enhance primary care providers' efforts to address their patients' non-medical barriers to treatment, as can embedding behavioral health providers within primary care offices. The study also underscores the need for trauma-informed care in primary care settings.",Characteristics and behavioral health needs of patients with patterns of high hospital use: implications for primary care providers.
"Nail involvement in psoriasis is common, and the severity of it does not always parallel the intensity of cutaneous disease. We created a consensus group, of which the aim was to provide practical recommendations for the treatment of nail psoriasis in patients without skin psoriasis, or with mild skin lesions with no indication for a systemic treatment. This collaborative process was conducted by an international panel of dermatologists with special expertise in nail disorders, using a formal consensus methodology. During this process, the panel strived to establish an agreement regarding the definition of nail psoriasis, the severity of nail psoriasis, and treatment response. Treatment recommendations are provided regarding nail psoriasis severity and matrix or bed involvement. ""Few-nail"" disease was considered as nail psoriasis affecting 3 or less nails. In the case of matrix involvement only, intralesional steroid injections were considered the treatment of choice.

"BACKGROUND: Closed reduction (CR) is a common treatment for infantile developmental dysplasia of the hip. The purpose of this observational, prospective, multicenter study was to determine the early outcomes following CR. METHODS: Prospectively collected data from an international multicenter study group was analyzed for patients treated from 2010 to 2014. Baseline demographics, clinical exam, radiographic/ultrasonographic data, and history of previous orthotic treatment were assessed. At minimum 1-year follow-up, failure was defined as an IHDI grade 3 or 4 hip and/or need for open reduction. The incidence of avascular necrosis (AVN), residual dysplasia, and need for further surgery was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients undergoing CR for 87 hips were evaluated with a median age at initial reduction of 8 months (range, 1 to 20 mo). Of these, 8 hips (9%) were unable to be closed reduced initially. At most recent follow-up (median 22 mo; range, 12 to 36 mo), 72/79 initially successful CRs (91%) remained stable. The likelihood of failure was unaffected by initial clinical reducibility of the hip (P=0.434), age at initial CR (P=0.897), or previous treatment in brace (P=0.222). Excluding those hips that failed initial CR, 18/72 hips (25%) developed AVN, and the risk of osteonecrosis was unaffected by prereduction reducibility of the hip (P=0.586), age at CR (P=0.745), presence of an ossific nucleus (P=0.496), or previous treatment in brace (P=0.662). Mean acetabular index on most recent radiographs was 25 degrees (+/-6 degrees), and was also unaffected by any of the above variables. During the follow-up period, 8/72 successfully closed reduced hips (11%) underwent acetabular and/or femoral osteotomy for residual dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Following an initially successful CR, 9% of hips failed reduction and 25% developed radiographic AVN at early-term follow-up. History of femoral head reducibility, previous orthotic bracing, and age at CR did not correlate with success or chances of developing AVN. Further follow-up of this prospective, multicenter cohort will be necessary to establish definitive success and complication rates following CR for infantile developmental dysplasia of the hip.

"It is now accepted that neurons contain and release multiple transmitter substances. However, we still have only limited insight into the regulation and functional effects of this co-transmission. Given that there are 200 or more neurotransmitters, the chemical complexity of the nervous system is daunting. This is made more-so by the fact that their interacting effects can generate diverse non-linear and novel consequences. The relatively poor history of pharmacological approaches likely reflects the fact that manipulating a transmitter system will not necessarily mimic its roles within the normal chemical environment of the nervous system (e.g., when it acts in parallel with co-transmitters). In this article, co-transmission is discussed in a range of systems [from invertebrate and lower vertebrate models, up to the mammalian peripheral and central nervous system (CNS)] to highlight approaches used, degree of understanding, and open questions and future directions. Finally, we offer some outlines of what we consider to be the general principles of co-transmission, as well as what we think are the most pressing general aspects that need to be addressed to move forward in our understanding of co-transmission.",General Principles of Neuronal Co-transmission: Insights From Multiple Model Systems.
"Acyl CoA metabolites derived from the catabolism of carbon fuels can react with lysine residues of mitochondrial proteins, giving rise to a large family of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Mass spectrometry-based detection of thousands of acyl-PTMs scattered throughout the proteome has established a strong link between mitochondrial hyperacylation and cardiometabolic diseases; however, the functional consequences of these modifications remain uncertain. Here, we use a comprehensive respiratory diagnostics platform to evaluate three disparate models of mitochondrial hyperacylation in the mouse heart caused by genetic deletion of malonyl CoA decarboxylase (MCD), SIRT5 demalonylase and desuccinylase, or SIRT3 deacetylase. In each case, elevated acylation is accompanied by marginal respiratory phenotypes. Of the >60 mitochondrial energy fluxes evaluated, the only outcome consistently observed across models is a approximately 15% decrease in ATP synthase activity. In sum, the findings suggest that the vast majority of mitochondrial acyl PTMs occur as stochastic events that minimally affect mitochondrial bioenergetics.",Respiratory Phenomics across Multiple Models of Protein Hyperacylation in Cardiac Mitochondria Reveals a Marginal Impact on Bioenergetics.

"PURPOSE: African-American (AA) patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are less likely to achieve pathologic complete response from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and have poorer prognosis than Caucasian patients with TNBC, suggesting potential biological differences by race. Immune infiltration is the most consistent predictive marker for chemotherapy response and improved prognosis in TNBC. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the immune microenvironment differs between AA and Caucasian patients. METHODS: RNA-seq expression data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for 162 AA and 697 Caucasian breast cancers. Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive, and TNBC subtypes were included in the analyses. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) counts, immunomodulatory scores, and molecular subtypes were obtained from prior publications for a subset of the TNBC cases. Differences in immune cell distributions and immune functions, measured through gene expression and TIL counts, as well as neoantigen, somatic mutation, amplification, and deletion loads, were compared by race and tumor subtype. RESULTS: Immune metagene analysis demonstrated marginal immune attenuation in AA TNBC relative to Caucasian TNBC that did not reach statistical significance. The distributions of immune cell populations, lymphocyte infiltration, molecular subtypes, and genomic aberrations between AA and Caucasian subtypes were also not significantly different. The MHC1 metagene demonstrated increased expression in AA ER-positive cancers relative to Caucasian ER-positive cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the immunological differences between AA and Caucasian breast cancers represented by TCGA data are subtle, if they exist at all. We observed no consistent racial differences in immune gene expression or TIL counts in TNBC by race. However, this study cannot rule out small differences in immune cell subtype distribution and activity status that may not be apparent in bulk RNA analysis.",Immune microenvironment of triple-negative breast cancer in African-American and Caucasian women.

"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little prospective evidence exists on the effects of OSA treatment in preclinical AD. The objective was to determine if continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment adherence, controlling for baseline differences, predicts cognitive and everyday function after 1 year in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to determine effect sizes for a larger trial. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental pilot clinical trial with CPAP adherence defined as CPAP use 4 hours or more per night over 1 year. SETTING: Sleep and geriatric clinics and community. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults, aged 55 to 89 years, with an apnea-hypopnea index of 10 or higher participated: (1) MCI, OSA, and CPAP adherent (MCI +CPAP), n = 29; and (2) MCI, OSA, CPAP nonadherent (MCI -CPAP), n = 25. INTERVENTION: CPAP. MEASUREMENTS: The primary cognitive outcome was memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised), and the secondary cognitive outcome was psychomotor/cognitive processing speed (Digit Symbol subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Substitution Test). Secondary function and progression measures were the Everyday Cognition, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change Scale, and Clinical Dementia Rating. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in psychomotor/cognitive processing speed in the MCI +CPAP group vs the MCI -CPAP group were observed at 1 year after adjustment for age, race, and marital status (parameter estimate = 1.68; standard error = 0.47; 95% confidence interval = 0.73-2.62), with a 6-month effect size (ES) of 0.46 and a 1-year ES of 1.25. There were small to moderate ESs for memory (ES 0.20, 6 mo), attention (ES 0.25, 1 y), daytime sleepiness (ES 0.33, 6 mo and ES 0.22, 1 y), and everyday function (ES 0.50, 6 mo) favoring the MCI +CPAP group vs the MCI -CPAP group. CONCLUSION: Controlling for baseline differences, 1 year of CPAP adherence in MCI +OSA significantly improved cognition, compared with a nonadherent control group, and may slow the trajectory of cognitive decline.

"Purpose A new dual-layer multi-leaf collimator (MLC) system with several improved characteristics was introduced with the Varian Halcyon treatment platform. This study evaluated this new MLC's impact on head and neck plan quality and delivery efficiency. Methods Nine patients were retrospectively studied with Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. To compare plan quality between the Halcyon dual-layer MLC and Truebeam(R) MLC, all patients were replanned with the same prescription and target coverage following the institutional clinical protocol for both platforms and using both intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetrically modulated arc therapy (VMAT) techniques. Organs-at-risk (OAR) dose-volume histogram (DVH) statistics were compared along with total plan monitor units (MU). To evaluate delivery efficiency, actual beam-on time for five patients' plans were recorded and compared. To evaluate the impact of MLC performance parameters on plan quality, virtual MLC models were generated by matching Truebeam MLC's parameters to those of the Halcyon dual-layer MLC both individually and combined. OAR doses were then compared between these virtual MLCs, the Truebeam MLC, and the actual Halcyon MLC. Results Overall the Halcyon dual-layer MLC provided similar plan quality compared to Truebeam MLC for VMAT plans, and improved sparing for majority of the OARs when using IMRT. Paired comparison showed median dose differences in mean doses to the parotids, cochlea, esophagus, and larynx ranged from -0.83 Gy to 0.37 Gy for VMAT, and from -4.79 Gy to -0.04 Gy for IMRT, with negative values indicating improved performance by Halcyon. Despite a slight increase in plan MU, the Halcyon reduced the total beam-on time by 42.8 +/- 8.5%. Virtual MLC simulations demonstrated that matching MLC transmission accounted for nearly half of the total dose difference between Halcyon and Truebeam IMRT plans. Conclusion When compared to the Truebeam, the Halcyon's dual-layer MLC achieved similar plan quality using VMAT, and improved OAR sparing using IMRT, while providing nearly twice as fast treatment delivery. Reduction in MLC transmission is the dominating factor contributing to dosimetric differences in OAR sparing.",Impact of Multi-leaf Collimator Parameters on Head and Neck Plan Quality and Delivery: A Comparison between Halcyon and Truebeam(R) Treatment Delivery Systems.

"Myocardial blood flow and myocardial blood flow reserve (MBFR) measurements are often used clinically to quantify coronary microvascular function. Developing imaging-based methods to measure MBFR for research in mice would be advantageous for evaluating new treatment methods for coronary microvascular disease (CMVD), yet this is more challenging in mice than in humans. This work investigates microSPECT's quantitative capabilities of cardiac imaging by utilizing a multi-part cardiac phantom and applying a known kinetic model to synthesize kinetic data from static data, allowing for assessment of kinetic modeling accuracy. The phantom was designed with four main components: two left-ventricular (LV) myocardial sections and two LV blood-pool sections, sized for end-systole (ES) and end-diastole (ED). Each section of the phantom was imaged separately while acquiring list-mode data. These static, separate-compartment data were manipulated into synthetic dynamic data using a kinetic model representing the myocardium and blood-pool activity concentrations over time and then combined into a set of dynamic image frames and reconstructed. Regions of interest were drawn on the resulting images, and kinetic parameters were estimated. This process was performed for three tracer uptake values (K 1), three myocardial wall thicknesses, ten filter parameters, and 20 iterations for 25 noise ensembles. The degree of filtering and iteration number were optimized to minimize the root mean-squared error (RMSE) of K 1 values, with the largest number of iterations and minimal filtering yielding the lowest error. Using the optimized parameters, K 1 was determined with reasonable error (~3% RMSE) over all wall thicknesses and K 1 input values. This work demonstrates that accurate and precise measurements of K 1 are possible for the U-SPECT+ system used in this study, for several different uptake rates and LV dimensions. Additionally, it allows for future investigation utilizing other imaging systems, including PET studies with any radiotracer, as well as with additional phantom parts containing lesions.",Quantification of myocardial uptake rate constants in dynamic small-animal SPECT using a cardiac phantom.
"Interprofessional education (IPE) is a critical component of medical education and is affected by the characteristics of the clinical teams in which students and residents train. However, clinical teams are often shaped by professional silos and hierarchies which may hinder interprofessional collaborative practice (IPCP). Narrative medicine, a branch of health humanities that focuses on close reading, reflective writing, and sharing in groups, could be an innovative approach for improving IPE and IPCP. In this report, we describe the structure, feasibility, and a process-oriented program evaluation of a narrative medicine program implemented in interprofessional team meetings in three academic primary care clinics. Program evaluation revealed that a year-long narrative medicine program with modest monthly exposure was feasible in academic clinical settings. Staff members expressed engagement and acceptability as well as support for ongoing implementation. Program success required administrative buy-in and sustainability may require staff training in narrative medicine.",Implementing an interprofessional narrative medicine program in academic clinics: Feasibility and program evaluation.
"Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a prominent feature in adult and pediatric interstitial lung disease (ILD and ChILD), but in vivo models linking AT2 cell ER stress to ILD have been elusive. Based on a clinical ChILD case, we identified a critical cysteine residue in the surfactant protein C gene (SFTPC) BRICHOS domain whose mutation induced ER stress in vitro. To model this in vivo, we generated a knockin mouse model expressing a cysteine-to-glycine substitution at codon 121 (C121G) in the Sftpc gene. SftpcC121G expression during fetal development resulted in a toxic gain-of-function causing fatal postnatal respiratory failure from disrupted lung morphogenesis. Induced SftpcC121G expression in adult mice resulted in an ER-retained pro-protein causing AT2 cell ER stress. SftpcC121G AT2 cells were a source of cytokines expressed in concert with development of polycellular alveolitis. These cytokines were subsequently found in a high-dimensional proteomic screen of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from ChILD patients with the same class of SFTPC mutations. Following alveolitis resolution, SftpcC121G mice developed spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis and restrictive lung impairment. This model provides proof of concept linking AT2 cell ER stress to fibrotic lung disease coupled with translationally relevant biomarkers.",An SFTPC BRICHOS mutant links epithelial ER stress and spontaneous lung fibrosis.

"BACKGROUND: There is a need for improved opioid stewardship in orthopedic surgery through multimodal analgesia strategies. Perioperative administration of ketorolac in children undergoing closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) for displaced supracondylar humerus (SCH) fracture may decrease pain, reduce opioid requirements, and decrease hospitalization costs. METHODS: Retrospective case-control investigation of children (aged, 1 to 14) treated with CRPP for closed, modified Gartland type III extension-type SCH fractures at a single children's hospital between 2011 and 2017. Patients that received ketorolac perioperatively (cases) were randomly matched 1:2 by sex and age (+/-1 y) with patients that did not receive ketorolac (controls). Data abstraction included demographic and perioperative details including inpatient Wong-Baker FACES pain ratings and analgesic requirements. Analysis included 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U and chi tests. RESULTS: In total, 342 patients were studied including 114 cases and 228 controls. Age (mean, 6.2+/-2.4 y), sex ratio (M:F, 1.28:1), operative time, and number of pins used were equivalent between groups. Mean pain rating at 0 to 29 minutes postoperatively was lower in the ketorolac group (0.7+/-1.9) than in controls (1.4+/-2.6, P=0.017), as well as at 30 to 120 minutes postoperatively (1.1+/-2.3 and 1.7+/-2.8, respectively, P=0.036), as seen in Figure 1. Patients in the ketorolac group received a lower number of inpatient oxycodone doses (1.0+/-0.6) than control patients (1.2+/-0.5, P=0.003). Mean postoperative length-of-stay (LOS) was 50.0% longer for control patients (20.4+/-11.3 h) than the ketorolac patients (13.6+/-8.8 h, P<0.001). Ketorolac administration was associated with 40.4% lower inpatient hospitalization cost compared to control patients, providing a 33.8 times return on investment. There was no difference in the 90-day complication rate between patient groups (P=0.905). CONCLUSIONS: The complementary administration of ketorolac reduces postoperative pain and opioid use in children with displaced supracondylar humerus fractures. Perioperative ketorolac is also associated with reduced LOS following CRPP for supracondylar humerus fractures and offers significant cost savings opportunities.

"Diffusion MRI is being used increasingly in studies of the brain and other parts of the body for its ability to provide quantitative measures that are sensitive to changes in tissue microstructure. However, inter-scanner and inter-protocol differences are known to induce significant measurement variability, which in turn jeopardises the ability to obtain 'truly quantitative measures' and challenges the reliable combination of different datasets. Combining datasets from different scanners and/or acquired at different time points could dramatically increase the statistical power of clinical studies, and facilitate multi-centre research. Even though careful harmonisation of acquisition parameters can reduce variability, inter-protocol differences become almost inevitable with improvements in hardware and sequence design over time, even within a site. In this work, we present a benchmark diffusion MRI database of the same subjects acquired on three distinct scanners with different maximum gradient strength (40, 80, and 300mT/m), and with 'standard' and 'state-of-the-art' protocols, where the latter have higher spatial and angular resolution. The dataset serves as a useful testbed for method development in cross-scanner/cross-protocol diffusion MRI harmonisation and quality enhancement. Using the database, we compare the performance of five different methods for estimating mappings between the scanners and protocols. The results show that cross-scanner harmonisation of single-shell diffusion data sets can reduce the variability between scanners, and highlight the promises and shortcomings of today's data harmonisation techniques.",Cross-scanner and cross-protocol diffusion MRI data harmonisation: A benchmark database and evaluation of algorithms.
,Factors associated with decision-making preferences among parents of infants in neonatal intensive care.
"BACKGROUND: Infants are commonly supported with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) such as nasal CPAP and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). These modes utilize a nasal/oral interface precluding use of a traditional airway flow sensor, such as a pneumotachometer (PNT), needed for pulmonary mechanics (PM) measurements. Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography (RIP), when properly calibrated, records tidal volume non-invasively from chest wall movements. Our aim was to integrate RIP into an existing neonatal pulmonary function testing system to measure PM in infants on NIV and to compare measurements of dynamic lung compliance (CL) and resistance (RL) using RIP with those obtained using a PNT. DESIGN/METHODS: RIP ribcage (RC) and abdominal (ABD) signals were recorded simultaneously with the flow signal from a PNT; transpulmonary pressure was estimated using an esophageal catheter. Two calibration algorithms were applied to obtain RC and ABD scaling factors. RESULTS: Forty PM measurements were performed on 25 infants (GA 31.5+/-2.9 weeks; birth weight 1598+/-510 g; median age 7 days). Correlation coefficients for RIP- vs. PNT-based PM were r2 = 0.987 for CL and r2 = 0.997 for RL. From Bland-Altman analysis, the mean bias (+/-95% CI) between RIP and PNT methods was -0.004+/-0.021 ml/cmH2O/kg for CL and 0.7+/-2.9 cmH2O/(L/sec) for RL. The upper, lower limits of agreement (+/-95% CI) were 0.128+/-0.037, -0.135+/-0.037 ml/cmH2O/kg for CL and 18.6+/-5.1, -17.2+/-5.1 cmH2O/(L/sec) for RL. CONCLUSION: Properly calibrated RIP may be a useful tool with sufficient diagnostic accuracy for PM measurements without need for a nasal/oral airflow sensor in infants receiving NIV.",Pulmonary mechanics measurements by respiratory inductive plethysmography and esophageal manometry: Methodology for infants on non-invasive respiratory support.
"OBJECTIVES: Screening tests of global cognition detect racial differences in scores even after adjustment for educational attainment. Differential educational environments in adolescence may affect individual cognitive function. This study examines the impact of high school educational quality on late-life cognition among community-dwelling older adults. METHODS/DESIGN: Data were collected from community-dwelling individuals from the Philadelphia Healthy Brain Aging (PHBA) cohort at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. The present analysis included subjects from the PHBA over the age of 55 years without a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or dementia, who had attended high school in the City of Philadelphia. Cognition was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); clinical information was abstracted from the subject's electronic health record. High school information was obtained from the Philadelphia Board of Education. After univariable correlations were defined, we performed stepwise multiple linear regression models to determine the most significant predictors of late-life cognitive status. RESULTS: A total of 130 subjects meeting inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. Years of education, race, educational level, school district, and financial status were all positively associated with MoCA. Significant negative associations included composite vascular risk, attendance at highly segregated schools, and historical poverty status. In stepwise multiple linear regression modeling, the impact of race on cognition remained significant when educational attainment was added to the model but was no longer significant once segregation status was added. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that academic and community factors beyond years of education have a marked impact on late-life cognition.",Quality of education impacts late-life cognition.

"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms and rare mutations in factor H (FH; official name, CFH) are associated with age-related macular degeneration and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, a form of thrombotic microangiopathy. Mice with the FH W1206R mutation (FH(R/R)) share features with human atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. Herein, we report that FH(R/R) mice exhibited retinal vascular occlusion and ischemia. Retinal fluorescein angiography demonstrated delayed perfusion and vascular leakage in FH(R/R) mice. Optical coherence tomography imaging of FH(R/R) mice showed retinal degeneration, edema, and detachment. Histologic analysis of FH(R/R) mice revealed retinal thinning, vessel occlusion, as well as degeneration of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium. Immunofluorescence showed albumin leakage from blood vessels into the neural retina, and electron microscopy demonstrated vascular endothelial cell irregularity with narrowing of retinal and choroidal vessels. Knockout of C6, a component of the membrane attack complex, prevented the aforementioned retinal phenotype in FH(R/R) mice, consistent with membrane attack complex-mediated pathogenesis. Pharmacologic blockade of C5 also rescued retinas of FH(R/R) mice. This FH(R/R) mouse strain represents a model for retinal vascular occlusive disorders and ischemic retinopathy. The results suggest complement dysregulation can contribute to retinal vascular occlusion and that an anti-C5 antibody might be helpful for C5-mediated thrombotic retinal diseases.",Complement Factor H Mutation W1206R Causes Retinal Thrombosis and Ischemic Retinopathy in Mice.
"It is imperative to find the balance between pain control and addressing the opioid epidemic. Opioids, although effective in the acute pain management, have multiple side effects and can lead to dependence, abuse, overdose, or death. Physicians should identify patients who abuse opioids, using their states' prescription drug-monitoring programs and use screening tools to identify patients at increased risk of developing opioid dependence.

"Funding for research has become increasingly difficult to obtain in an environment of decreasing clinical revenue, increasing research costs, and growing competition for federal and nonfederal funding sources. This paper identifies critical requirements to build and sustain a successful radiology research program (eg, key personnel and leadership, research training and mentorship, infrastructure, institutional and departmental funding or support), reviews the current state of available funding for radiology (including federal, nonfederal, philanthropy, crowdfunding, and industry), and describes promising opportunities for future funding (eg, health services, comparative effectiveness, and patient-centered outcomes research). The funding climate, especially at the federal level, changes periodically, so it is important to have radiology-specific organizations such as the American College of Radiology and the Academy of Radiology Research serving as our key advocates. Key to obtaining any funding, no matter what the source, is a well-formulated grant proposal, so a review of opportunities specifically available to radiologists to develop and hone their grant-writing skills is provided.

"SUMMARYRecent observations showed that nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts, pre-mRNAs, and noncoding RNAs are highly susceptible to premature 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) from numerous intronic cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs). The importance of this in gene regulation was not previously appreciated as PASs, despite their prevalence, were thought to be active in terminal exons at gene ends. Unexpectedly, antisense oligonucleotide interference with U1 snRNA base-pairing to 5' splice sites, which is necessary for U1 snRNP's (U1) function in splicing, caused widespread PCPA in metazoans. This uncovered U1's PCPA suppression activity, termed telescripting, as crucial for full-length transcription in thousands of vertebrate genes, providing a general role in transcription elongation control. Progressive intron-size expansion in metazoan evolution greatly increased PCPA vulnerability and dependence on U1 telescripting. We describe how these observations unfolded and discuss U1 telescripting's role in shaping the transcriptome.",U1 snRNP Telescripting: Suppression of Premature Transcription Termination in Introns as a New Layer of Gene Regulation.
"Microbiome sequence analyses have suggested that changes in gut bacterial composition are associated with autoimmune disease in humans and animal models. However, little is known of the mechanisms through which the gut microbiota influences autoimmune responses to distant tissues. Here, we evaluated systemic antibody responses against cultured human gut bacterial strains to determine whether observed patterns of anticommensal antibody (ACAb) responses are associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in two cohorts of pediatric study participants. In the first cohort, ACAb responses in sera collected from participants within 6 months of T1D diagnosis were compared with age-matched healthy controls and also with patients with recent onset Crohn's disease. ACAb responses against multiple bacterial species discriminated among these three groups. In the second cohort, we asked whether ACAb responses present before diagnosis were associated with later T1D development and with HLA genotype in participants who were discordant for subsequent progression to diabetes. Serum IgG2 antibodies against Roseburia faecis and against a bacterial consortium were associated with future T1D diagnosis in an HLA DR3/DR4 haplotype-dependent manner. These analyses reveal associations between antibody responses to intestinal microbes and HLA-DR genotype and islet autoantibody specificity and with a future diagnosis of T1D. Further, we present a platform to investigate antibacterial antibodies in biological fluids that is applicable to studies of autoimmune diseases and responses to therapeutic interventions.",Association of HLA-dependent islet autoimmunity with systemic antibody responses to intestinal commensal bacteria in children.

"Caveolins (CAVs) are structural proteins of caveolae that function as signaling platforms to regulate smooth muscle contraction. Loss of CAV protein expression is associated with impaired contraction in obstruction-induced bladder smooth muscle (BSM) hypertrophy. In this study, microarray analysis of bladder RNA revealed down-regulation of CAV1, CAV2, and CAV3 gene transcription in BSM from models of obstructive bladder disease in mice and humans. We identified and characterized regulatory regions responsible for CAV1, CAV2, and CAV3 gene expression in mice with obstruction-induced BSM hypertrophy, and in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. DNA affinity chromatography and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed a greater increase in binding of GATA-6 and NF-kappaB to their cognate binding motifs on CAV1, CAV2, and CAV3 promoters in obstructed BSM relative to that observed in control BSM. Knockout of NF-kappaB subunits, shRNA-mediated knockdown of GATA-6, or pharmacologic inhibition of GATA-6 and NF-kappaB in BSM increased CAV1, CAV2, and CAV3 transcription and promoter activity. Conversely, overexpression of GATA-6 decreased CAV2 and CAV3 transcription and promoter activity.

"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Older adults frequently receive post-acute care (PAC) after hospital discharge, but little is known about how perceived costs influence PAC choices. This research study sought to understand how clinicians, patients, and their caregivers evaluate the cost of skilled nursing facility (SNF) care in their decisions about whether to utilize SNFs after hospital discharge. DESIGN: Guided by principles of social constructivist theory, we conducted a qualitative interpretative study using semistructured interviews with clinicians, patients, and caregivers. SETTING: The study took place in three SNFs and three hospitals located in an urban area. Purposive sampling was used to maximize variability in SNFs, hospitals, units within hospitals, and staff. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 104 participants made up the study: 25 hospital clinicians, 20 SNF clinicians, 20 hospital patients, 15 SNF patients, 14 hospital caregivers, and 10 SNF caregivers who were directly involved in patients' transition from acute hospitalization to SNFs. MEASUREMENTS: Central themes related to how perceived costs of care influence PAC choices. RESULTS: Clinicians, patients, and caregivers did not understand the nuances of SNF insurance coverage or out-of-pocket costs. They felt constrained by insurance coverage in their discharge disposition choices and faced delays in hospital discharge due to insurance authorization processes. Some clinicians reacted to these constraints by ""documenting failure,"" sending patients home to ""fail"" so they could justify SNF to insurers. Others changed their recommendations to provide patients ""some"" postdischarge care, even if inadequate, because of cost constraints. Clinicians discussed conserving resources to take maximal advantage of insurance-covered SNF days. Overall, cost constraint resulted in patient safety concerns, clinician professional dilemma, and moral distress. CONCLUSION: Improving patient and caregiver understanding about costs and constraints of PAC would improve decision making. There is a need for improved comprehension of cost and insurance coverage of SNF care for informed patient and provider decision making at the time of hospital discharge.","Perceived Costs of Care Influence Post-Acute Care Choices by Clinicians, Patients, and Caregivers."

PATIENTS: Fifty-eight children between the ages of 3-17 years with new traumatic or nontraumatic brain insult and expected ICU admission greater than 48 hours. INTERVENTIONS: Early protocolized (consultation of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy within 72 hr ICU admission, n = 26) or usual care (consultation per treating team, n = 32). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcomes were consultation timing, treatment type, and frequency of deferrals and safety events. Secondary outcomes included patient and family functional and quality of life outcomes at 6 months. Comparing early protocolized (n = 26) and usual care groups (n = 32), physical therapy was consulted during the hospital admission in 26 of 26 versus 28 of 32 subjects (p = 0.062) on day 2.4 +/- 0.8 versus 7.7 +/- 4.8 (p = 0.001); occupational therapy in 26 of 26 versus 23 of 32 (p = 0.003), on day 2.3 +/- 0.6 versus 6.9 +/- 4.8 (p = 0.001); and speech and language therapy in 26 of 26 versus 17 of 32 (p = 0.011) on day 2.3 +/- 0.7 versus 13.0 +/- 10.8 (p = 0.026). More children in the early protocolized group had consults and treatments occur in the ICU versus ward for all three services (all p < 0.001). Eleven sessions were discontinued early: nine during physical therapy and two during occupational therapy, none impacting patient outcome. There were no group differences in functional or quality of life outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: A protocol for early personalized rehabilitation by physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy in pediatric neurocritical care patients could be safely implemented and led to more ICU-based treatment sessions, accelerating the temporal profile and changing composition of interventions versus usual care, but not altering the total dose of rehabilitation.",Early Protocolized Versus Usual Care Rehabilitation for Pediatric Neurocritical Care Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
"WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Rapid response to witnessed, pulseless cardiac arrest is associated with increased survival. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: Assessment of witnessed, pulseless cardiac arrests occurring at 538 hospitals during a 9-yr period indicates that CPR did not occur immediately at 0 min in 5.7% of patients despite guidelines for instantaneous initiation. Delay in initiation of CPR was associated with significantly decreased survival.Time to initiation of CPR and subsequent time to initiation of administration of defibrillation shock (for shockable arrhythmias) and epinephrine were both associated with reduced patient survival. BACKGROUND: Because the extent to which delays in initiating cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) versus the time from CPR to defibrillation or epinephrine treatment affects survival remains unknown, it was hypothesized that all three independently decrease survival in in-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: Witnessed, index cases of cardiac arrest from the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation Database occurring between 2000 and 2008 in 538 hospitals were included in this analysis. Multivariable risk-adjusted logistic regression examined the association of time to initiation of CPR and time from CPR to either epinephrine treatment or defibrillation with survival to discharge. RESULTS: In the overall cohort of 57,312 patients, there were 9,802 survivors (17.1%). Times to initiation of CPR greater than 2 min were associated with a survival of 14.7% (91 of 618) as compared with 17.1% (9,711 of 56,694) if CPR was begun in 2 min or less (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], 0.68 [0.54 to 0.87]; P < 0.002). Times from CPR to either defibrillation or epinephrine treatment of 2 min or less were associated with a survival of 18.0% (7,654 of 42,475), as compared with 15.0% (1,680 of 11,227) for 3 to 5 min (reference, 0 to 2 min; adjusted odds ratios [95% CI], 0.83 [0.78 to 0.88]; P < 0.001), 12.8% (382 of 2,983) for 6 to 8 min (0.67 [0.60 to 0.76], P < 0.001), and 13.7% (86 of 627) for 9 to 11 min (0.54 [0.42 to 0.69], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Delays in the initiation of CPR and from CPR to defibrillation or epinephrine treatment were each associated with lower survival.","Delays in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, Defibrillation, and Epinephrine Administration All Decrease Survival in In-hospital Cardiac Arrest."

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a perceived shortage of evidence-based treatment programs for adults on the autism spectrum. This article reviews the recent research literature on psychosocial/behavioral interventions targeting social functioning in autistic adults without intellectual disability. RECENT FINDINGS: We identified only 41 peer-reviewed studies published from 1980 to 2017 that tested intervention programs focused on one or more of the behavioral components of social functioning (i.e., social motivation, social anxiety, social cognition, and social skills) in more than one adult with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The studies demonstrated substantial variability in treatment objectives, intervention procedures, assessment methods, and methodologic quality. The results indicate a strong need for additional research to develop and rigorously test interventions for autistic adults that target the many behavioral components of social functioning and that include procedures to promote generalization of knowledge and skills to community settings.",Psychosocial Interventions Targeting Social Functioning in Adults on the Autism Spectrum: a Literature Review.
"Rumination and impaired inhibition are considered core characteristics of depression. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms that contribute to these atypical cognitive processes remain unclear. To address this question, we apply a computational network control theory (NCT) approach to structural brain imaging data acquired via diffusion tensor imaging in a large sample of participants, to examine how NCT relates to individual differences in subclinical depression. Recent application of this theory at the neural level is built on a model of brain dynamics, which mathematically models patterns of inter-region activity propagated along the structure of an underlying network. The strength of this approach is its ability to characterize the potential role of each brain region in regulating whole-brain network function based on its anatomical fingerprint and a simplified model of node dynamics. We find that subclinical depression is negatively related to higher integration abilities in the right anterior insula, replicating and extending previous studies implicating atypical switching between the default mode and executive control networks in depression. We also find that subclinical depression is related to the ability to ""drive"" the brain system into easy to reach neural states in several brain regions, including the bilateral lingual gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus. These findings highlight brain regions less known in their role in depression, and clarify their roles in driving the brain into different neural states related to depression symptoms.",A computational network control theory analysis of depression symptoms.
"Purpose: Daily magnetic resonance (MR)-guided radiation has the potential to improve stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for tumors of the liver. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) introduces unique variables that are untested clinically: electron return effect, MRI geometric distortion, MRI to radiation therapy isocenter uncertainty, multileaf collimator position error, and uncertainties with voxel size and tracking. All could lead to increased toxicity and/or local recurrences with SBRT. In this multi-institutional study, we hypothesized that direct visualization provided by MR guidance could allow the use of small treatment volumes to spare normal tissues while maintaining clinical outcomes despite the aforementioned uncertainties in MR-guided treatment. Methods and materials: Patients with primary liver tumors or metastatic lesions treated with MR-guided liver SBRT were reviewed at 3 institutions. Toxicity was assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4. Freedom from local progression (FFLP) and overall survival were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and chi(2) test. Results: The study population consisted of 26 patients: 6 hepatocellular carcinomas, 2 cholangiocarcinomas, and 18 metastatic liver lesions (44% colorectal metastasis). The median follow-up was 21.2 months. The median dose delivered was 50 Gy at 10 Gy/fraction. No grade 4 or greater gastrointestinal toxicities were observed after treatment. The 1-year and 2-year overall survival in this cohort is 69% and 60%, respectively. At the median follow-up, FFLP for this cohort was 80.4%. FFLP for patients with hepatocellular carcinomas, colorectal metastasis, and all other lesions were 100%, 75%, and 83%, respectively. Conclusions: This study describes the first clinical outcomes of MR-guided liver SBRT. Treatment was well tolerated by patients with excellent local control. This study lays the foundation for future dose escalation and adaptive treatment for liver-based primary malignancies and/or metastatic disease.",A Multi-Institutional Experience of MR-Guided Liver Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.
"Hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) are X-linked bleeding disorders due to inheritable deficiencies in either coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), respectively. Recently, gene therapy clinical trials with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and protein-engineered transgenes, B-domain deleted (BDD) FVIII and FIX-Padua, have reported near-phenotypic cures in subjects with HA and HB, respectively. Here, we review the biology and the clinical development of FVIII-BDD and FIX-Padua as transgenes. We also examine alternative bioengineering strategies for FVIII and FIX, as well as the immunological challenges of these approaches. Other engineered proteins and their potential use in gene therapy for hemophilia with inhibitors are also discussed. Continued advancement of gene therapy for HA and HB using protein-engineered transgenes has the potential to alleviate the substantial medical and psychosocial burdens of the disease.",Protein-Engineered Coagulation Factors for Hemophilia Gene Therapy.
"PRRX1 is a homeodomain transcriptional factor, which has two isoforms, PRXX1A and PRRX1B. The PRRX1 isoforms have been demonstrated to be important in pancreatic cancer, especially in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in liver metastasis. In order to determine the functional underpinnings of PRRX1 and its isoforms, we have unraveled a new interplay between PRRX1 and the FOXM1 transcriptional factors. Our detailed biochemical analysis reveals the direct physical interaction between PRRX1 and FOXM1 proteins that requires the PRRX1A/B 200-222/217 amino acid (aa) region and the FOXM1 Forkhead domain. Additionally, we demonstrate the cooperation between PRRX1 and FOXM1 in the regulation of FOXM1-dependent transcriptional activity. Moreover, we establish FOXM1 as a critical downstream target of PRRX1 in pancreatic cancer cells. We demonstrate a novel role for PRRX1 in the regulation of genes involved in DNA repair pathways. Indeed, we show that expression of PRRX1 isoforms may limit the induction of DNA damage in pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrate that targeting FOXM1 with the small molecule inhibitor FDI6 suppress pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and induces their apoptotic cell death. FDI6 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to Etoposide and Gemcitabine induced apoptosis. Our data provide new insights into PRRX1's involvement in regulating DNA damage and provide evidence of a possible PRRX1-FOXM1 axis that is critical for PDAC cells.",PRRX1 isoforms cooperate with FOXM1 to regulate the DNA damage response in pancreatic cancer cells.
"Sleep remains a major mystery of biology. In particular, little is known about the mechanisms that account for the drive to sleep. In an unbiased screen of more than 12,000 Drosophila lines, we identified a single gene, nemuri, that induces sleep. The NEMURI protein is an antimicrobial peptide that can be secreted ectopically to drive prolonged sleep (with resistance to arousal) and to promote survival after infection. Loss of nemuri increased arousability during daily sleep and attenuated the acute increase in sleep induced by sleep deprivation or bacterial infection. Conditions that increase sleep drive induced expression of nemuri in a small number of fly brain neurons and targeted it to the sleep-promoting, dorsal fan-shaped body. We propose that NEMURI is a bona fide sleep homeostasis factor that is particularly important under conditions of high sleep need; because these conditions include sickness, our findings provide a link between sleep and immune function.","A sleep-inducing gene, nemuri, links sleep and immune function in Drosophila."

"The 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine (TP) heterocycle, in spite of its relatively simple structure, has proved to be remarkably versatile as evidenced by its use in many different applications reported over the years in different areas of drug design. For example, as the ring system of TPs is isoelectronic with that of purines, this heterocycle has been proposed as a possible surrogate of the purine ring. However, depending on the choice of substituents, the TP ring has also been described as a potentially viable bio-isostere of the carboxylic acid functional group and of the N-acetyl fragment of epsilon-N-acetylated lysine. In addition, the metal-chelating properties of the TP ring have also been exploited to generate candidate treatments for cancer and parasitic diseases. In the present review article, we discuss recent applications of the TP scaffold in medicinal chemistry, and provide an overview of its properties and methods of synthesis.","1,2,4-Triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines in drug design."
"Newly revised regulations for human research affecting translational oncology will become effective in January 2019. A substantial component of the debate leading to this revision was how to regulate biospecimen research; specifically, whether all biospecimens should be considered inherently ""identifiable,"" thereby necessitating informed consent for use in research. The famous cases seminal to this discussion involve cancer cell lines, but the unique features of this kind of biospecimen research were largely missing from the regulatory deliberation. However, special aspects of cell line research-at the stages of procurement, generation, evolution, and sharing-alter how society should balance participant interests against the goals of research.

"BACKGROUND: The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 provides the framework to link reimbursement for providers based on outcome metrics. Concerns exist that the lack of risk adjustment for patients undergoing revision TKA for an infection may cause problems with access to care. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) After controlling for confounding variables, do patients undergoing revision TKA for infection have higher 30-day readmission, reoperation, and mortality rates than those undergoing revision TKA for aseptic causes? (2) Compared with patients undergoing revision TKA who are believed not to have infections, are patients undergoing revision for infected TKAs at increased risk for complications? METHODS: We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for patients undergoing revision TKA from 2012 to 2015 identified by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 27486, 27487, and 27488. Of the 10,848 patients identified, four were excluded with a diagnosis of malignancy (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code 170.7, 170.9, 171.8, or 198.5). This validated, national database records short-term outcome data for inpatient procedures and does not rely on administrative coding data. Demographic variables, comorbidities, and outcomes were compared between patients believed to have infected TKAs and those undergoing revision for aseptic causes. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent factors associated with complications, readmissions, reoperations, and mortality. RESULTS: After controlling for demographic factors and medical comorbidities, TKA revision for infection was independently associated with complications (odds ratio [OR], 3.736; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.198-4.365; p < 0.001), 30-day readmission (OR, 1.455; 95% CI, 1.207-1.755; p < 0.001), 30-day reoperation (OR, 1.614; 95% CI, 1.278-2.037; p < 0.001), and 30-day mortality (OR, 3.337; 95% CI, 1.213-9.180; p = 0.020). Patients with infected TKA had higher rates of postoperative infection (OR, 3.818; 95% CI, 3.082-4.728; p < 0.001), renal failure (OR, 36.709; 95% CI, 8.255-163.231; p < 0.001), sepsis (OR, 7.582; 95% CI, 5.529-10.397; p < 0.001), and septic shock (OR, 3.031; 95% CI, 1.376-6.675; p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers should be aware of the higher rate of mortality, readmissions, reoperations, and complications in patients with infected TKA. Without appropriate risk adjustment or excluding these patients all together from alternative payment and quality reporting models, fewer providers will be incentivized to care for patients with infected TKA.

"The identification of genes implicated in myopathies is essential for diagnosis and for revealing novel therapeutic targets. Here we characterize a novel subclass of congenital myopathy at the morphological, molecular, and functional level. Through exome sequencing, we identified de novo ACTN2 mutations, a missense and a deletion, in two unrelated patients presenting with progressive early-onset muscle weakness and respiratory involvement. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses of muscle biopsies revealed a distinctive pattern with the presence of muscle fibers containing small structured cores and jagged Z-lines. Deeper analysis of the missense mutation revealed mutant alpha-actinin-2 properly localized to the Z-line in differentiating myotubes and its level was not altered in muscle biopsy. Modelling of the disease in zebrafish and mice by exogenous expression of mutated alpha-actinin-2 recapitulated the abnormal muscle function and structure seen in the patients. Motor deficits were noted in zebrafish, and muscle force was impaired in isolated muscles from AAV-transduced mice. In both models, sarcomeric disorganization was evident, while expression of wild-type alpha-actinin-2 did not result in muscle anomalies. The murine muscles injected with mutant ACTN2 displayed cores and Z-line defects. Dominant ACTN2 mutations were previously associated with cardiomyopathies, and our data demonstrate that specific mutations in the well-known Z-line regulator alpha-actinin-2 can cause a skeletal muscle disorder.","ACTN2 mutations cause ""Multiple structured Core Disease"" (MsCD)."
"Sigma-2 receptors have been implicated in both tumor proliferation and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently the sigma-2 receptor was identified as transmembrane protein 97 (TMEM97). Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) was also recently reported to form a complex with TMEM97 and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, and this trimeric complex is responsible for the rapid internalization of LDL. Sigma-2 receptor ligands with various structures have been shown to induce cell death in cancer cells. In the current study, we examined the role of TMEM97 and PGRMC1 in mediating sigma-2 ligand-induced cell death. Cell viability and caspase-3 assays were performed in control, TMEM97 knockout (KO), PGRMC1 KO, and TMEM97/PGRMC1 double KO cell lines treated with several sigma-2 ligands. The data showed that knockout of TMEM97, PGRMC1, or both did not affect the concentrations of sigma-2 ligands that induced 50% of cell death (EC50), suggesting that cytotoxic effects of these compounds are not mediated by TMEM97 or PGRMC1. Sigma-1 receptor ligands, (+)-pentazocine and NE-100, did not block sigma-2 ligand cytotoxicity, suggesting that sigma-1 receptor was not responsible for sigma-2 ligand cytotoxicity. We also examined whether the alternative, residual binding site (RBS) of 1,3-Di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) could be responsible for sigma-2 ligand cytotoxicity. Our data showed that the binding affinities (K i) of sigma-2 ligands on the DTG RBS did not correlate with the cytotoxicity potency (EC50) of these ligands, suggesting that the DTG RBS was not fully responsible for sigma-2 ligand cytotoxicity. In addition, we showed that knocking out TMEM97, PGRMC1, or both reduced the initial internalization rate of a sigma-2 fluorescent ligand, SW120. However, concentrations of internalized SW120 became identical later in the control and knockout cells. These data suggest that the initial internalization process of sigma-2 ligands does not appear to mediate the cell-killing effect of sigma-2 ligands. In summary, we have provided evidence that sigma-2 receptor/TMEM97 and PGRMC1 do not mediate sigma-2 ligand cytotoxicity. Our work will facilitate elucidating mechanisms of sigma-2 ligand cytotoxicity.",TMEM97 and PGRMC1 do not mediate sigma-2 ligand-induced cell death.
"Mycobacterial lipoproteins are considered to be involved in both virulence and immunoregulatory processes during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection. In our previous investigations on the immunoreactivity of more than 30 M.tb proteins in active TB patients, we identified mycobacterial lipoprotein Z (LppZ) as one of the most immune dominant antigens. How LppZ triggers immune responses is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed LppZ-mediated innate and adaptive immunity using a murine air pouch model and an M.tb infection model, respectively. We found that LppZ could not only recruit inflammatory cells but also induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines inside the pouches. LppZ could also induce strong Th1 responses following immunization and confer protection against challenge with M.tb virulent strain H37Rv at a similar level to BCG vaccination but with less pathological damage in the lungs. Furthermore, we revealed the presence of LppZ-specific functional CD4(+) T cells in the lungs of the challenged mice that were capable of secreting double or triple cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-2, and TNF-alpha. Our study thus demonstrates that LppZ is of strong immunogenicity during M.tb infection in both humans and mice and has the ability to trigger effective innate and cellular immunity. Considering the limitations of candidate antigens in the pipeline of TB vaccine development, LppZ-mediated immune protection against M.tb challenge in the mouse model implies its potential application in vaccine development.",Mycobacterial Lipoprotein Z Triggers Efficient Innate and Adaptive Immunity for Protection Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection.
"CD4(+) T cells play critical roles in defending against poxviruses, both by potentiating cellular and humoral responses and by directly killing infected cells. Despite this central role, the basis for pox-specific CD4(+) T cell activation, specifically the origin of the poxvirus-derived peptides (epitopes) that activate CD4(+) T cells, remains poorly understood. In addition, because the current licensed poxvirus vaccines can cause serious adverse events and even death, elucidating the requirements for MHC class II (MHC-II) processing and presentation of poxviral Ags could be of great use. To address these questions, we explored the CD4(+) T cell immunogenicity of ectromelia, the causative agent of mousepox. Having identified a large panel of novel epitopes via a screen of algorithm-selected synthetic peptides, we observed that immunization of mice with inactivated poxvirus primes a virtually undetectable CD4(+) T cell response, even when adjuvanted, and is unable to provide protection against disease after a secondary challenge. We postulated that an important contributor to this outcome is the poor processability of whole virions for MHC-II-restricted presentation. In line with this hypothesis, we observed that whole poxvirions are very inefficiently converted into MHC-II-binding peptides by the APC as compared with subviral material. Thus, stability of the virion structure is a critical consideration in the rational design of a safe alternative to the existing live smallpox vaccine.",Poor Antigen Processing of Poxvirus Particles Limits CD4(+) T Cell Recognition and Impacts Immunogenicity of the Inactivated Vaccine.
"Amplification of the MYCN oncogene is associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor outcome in childhood neuroblastoma. Polyamines are highly regulated essential cations that are frequently elevated in cancer cells, and the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), is a direct transcriptional target of MYCN. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the ODC1 inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), although a promising therapeutic strategy, is only partially effective at impeding neuroblastoma cell growth due to activation of compensatory mechanisms resulting in increased polyamine uptake from the surrounding microenvironment. In this study, we identified solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2) as the key transporter involved in polyamine uptake in neuroblastoma. Knockdown of SLC3A2 in neuroblastoma cells reduced the uptake of the radiolabeled polyamine spermidine, and DFMO treatment increased SLC3A2 protein. In addition, MYCN directly increased polyamine synthesis and promoted neuroblastoma cell proliferation by regulating SLC3A2 and other regulatory components of the polyamine pathway. Inhibiting polyamine uptake with the small-molecule drug AMXT 1501, in combination with DFMO, prevented or delayed tumor development in neuroblastoma-prone mice and extended survival in rodent models of established tumors. Our findings suggest that combining AMXT 1501 and DFMO with standard chemotherapy might be an effective strategy for treating neuroblastoma.",Inhibition of polyamine synthesis and uptake reduces tumor progression and prolongs survival in mouse models of neuroblastoma.

"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence, age of onset, and risk factors for overweight and obesity in children with congenital heart disease (CHD). STUDY DESIGN: Children with CHD who were seen at our institution from 1996 to 2017 were studied. Patients were full-time residents of the United States and were receiving all cardiac care at our institution. Patients were categorized by age and CHD diagnosis. The date of last normal weight for age and the date of first recorded weight in the range of overweight and obese were documented. RESULTS: Nine hundred sixty-eight patients with CHD were included. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 31.5% and 16.4%, respectively. For patients who became overweight or obese, the last recorded normal weight was between 6 and 10 years of age. Electrophysiologic disease and older age were risk factors for obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CHD have an increasing risk of becoming overweight and obese in early childhood. This study provides important information and identifies critical period to implement preventative measures and counsel families about the risk of obesity in CHD.","Obesity trends in children, adolescents, and young adults with congenital heart disease."

"BACKGROUND: Adults with congenital heart disease face psychological challenges although an understanding of depression vs. anxiety symptoms is unclear. We analyzed the prevalence of elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression and explored associations with demographic and medical factors as well as quality of life. METHODS: Adults with congenital heart disease enrolled from an outpatient clinic completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and two measures of quality of life: the Linear Analogue Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Medical data were obtained by chart review. RESULTS: Of 130 patients (median age = 32 years; 55% female), 55 (42%) had elevated anxiety symptoms and 16 (12%) had elevated depression symptoms on subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Most patients with elevated depression symptoms also had elevated anxiety symptoms (15/16; 94%). Of 56 patients with at least one elevated subscale, 37 (66%) were not receiving mental health treatment. Compared to patients with 0 or 1 elevated subscales, patients with elevations in both (n=15) were less likely to be studying or working (47% vs. 81%; p=0.016) and reported lower scores on the Linear Analogue Scale (60 vs. 81, p&lt;0.001) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (14 vs. 28, p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with congenital heart disease, elevated anxiety symptoms are common and typically accompany elevated depressive symptoms. The combination is associated with unemployment and lower quality of life.

"BACKGROUND: Human milk is a life-saving medical intervention. Infants with congenital heart disease are at an increased risk for necrotizing enterocolitis, chylothorax, feeding difficulties, and growth failure. In the absence of evidence-based care, their mothers are also at risk for low milk supply and/or poor breastfeeding outcomes. PURPOSE: Summarize the role of human milk and clinical outcomes for infants with congenital heart disease (CHD). Summarize methods of ideal breastfeeding support. METHODS/SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were the databases used. The terms used for the search related to CHD and necrotizing enterocolitis were ""human milk"" and ""necrotizing enterocolitis"" and ""congenital heart disease."" This resulted in a total of 17 publications for review. FINDINGS: Infants receiving exclusive human milk diet are at a lower risk for necrotizing enterocolitis and will have improved weight gain. Infants with chylothorax who receive skimmed human milk have higher weight-for-age scores than formula-fed infants. Maternal breastfeeding education correlates with decreased risk of poor breastfeeding outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Human milk is the ideal source of nutrition for infants with CHD and should be encouraged by the care team. Evidence-based lactation education and care must be provided to mothers and families prenatally and continue throughout the infant's hospitalization. If a mother's goal is to directly breastfeed, this should be facilitated during the infant's hospital stay.

"BACKGROUND: While recent data has demonstrated the utility of lumbar pedicle screws for the treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis, the data are limited for thoracic pedicle screws. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of thoracic pedicle screws for the surgical treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis. METHODS: A retrospective review of all operations performed by 2 spinal neurosurgeons from 1999 to 2012 yielded 30 cases of vertebral osteomyelitis that were treated with thoracic pedicle screws. Sixteen (53%) of which underwent combined anterior and posterior fusion and 14 patients (47%) underwent standalone posterior fusion. Postoperative records were analyzed for pertinent clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients, 21 were males (70%), 8 were females (27%), and 1 was transsexual (3%). The mean age was 47 yr (range 18-69). The most common organism cultured was Staphylococcus aureus in 12 cases (50%). The mean patient stay in the hospital was 12.4 d after surgery (range 5-38 d). The mean antibiotic duration after discharge was 8 wk (range 1-24 wk). Of the 25 patients with long-term follow-up (mean, 49 mo), 92% had improved back pain (6/25 marked improvement, 17/25 complete resolution), 83% had improved muscle weakness (8/18 marked improvement, 7/18 complete resolution), and 100% had improved urinary incontinence (3/8 marked improvement, 5/8 complete resolution). Two patients (7%) required additional surgical revision due to instrumentation failure or wound infection.

"The Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) is a commonly used measure of risk of aberrant drug-related behaviors in patients with chronic pain prescribed opioid therapy. In this study, the discriminant predictive validity of the ORT was evaluated in a unique cohort of patients with chronic nonmalignant pain (CNMP) on long-term opioid therapy who displayed no evidence of developing an opioid use disorder (OUD) and a sample of patients with CNMP who developed an OUD after commencing opioid therapy. Results revealed that the original ORT was able to discriminate between patients with and without OUDs (odds ratio=1.624; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.539-1.715, P < .001). A weighted ORT eliminating the gender-specific history of preadolescent sexual abuse item revealed comparable results (odds ratio=1.648, 95% CI=1.539-1.742, P < .001). A revised unweighted ORT removing the history of preadolescent sexual abuse item was notably superior in predicting the development of OUD in patients with CNMP on long-term opioid therapy (odds ratio=3.085; 95% CI=2.725-3.493; P < .001) with high specificity (.851; 95% CI=.811-.885), sensitivity (.854; 95% CI=.799-.898), positive predictive value (.757; 95% CI=.709-.799), and negative predictive value (.914; 95% CI=.885-.937). Perspective: The revised ORT is the first tool developed on a unique cohort to predict the risk of developing an OUD in patients with CNMP receiving opioid therapy, as opposed to aberrant drug-related behaviors that can reflect a number of other issues. The revised ORT has clinical usefulness in providing clinicians a simple, validated method to rapidly screen for the risk of developing OUD in patients on or being considered for opioid therapy.",Development of the Revised Opioid Risk Tool to Predict Opioid Use Disorder in Patients with Chronic Nonmalignant Pain.
"Background: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) chronic prevalence among pregnant women in the United States (U.S.) U.S. doubled nationally from 2009-2014 (~0.7%), yet many remain undiagnosed. Screening pregnant women is not recommended by the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, despite new AASLD/IDSA guidelines recommending screening this group. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of HCV screening for pregnant women in the U.S. Methods: An HCV natural history Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal HCV screening of pregnant women followed by treatment after pregnancy compared to background risk-based screening from a health care payer perspective. We assumed 0.73% HCV chronic prevalence among pregnant women based on national data. We assume no Medicaid reimbursement restrictions by fibrosis stage at baseline, but explore differing restrictions in sensitivity analyses. We assessed cost (in USD$) and health outcomes (in quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) over a lifetime horizon, using new HCV drug costs of $25,000/treatment. We assess mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) under a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained. We additionally evaluate potential population impact. Results: Universal antenatal screening was cost-effective in all treatment eligibility scenarios (mean ICER <$3,000/QALY gained). Screening remained cost-effective at 0.07% prevalence, the lowest estimated prevalence state in the U.S. (Hawaii). Screening the ~5.04 million pregnant women in 2018 could result in detection and treatment of 33,000 women based on current fibrosis restrictions. Conclusions: Universal screening for HCV among pregnant women in the U.S. is cost effective and should be recommended nationally.",Cost-Effectiveness of Universal Hepatitis C Virus Screening of Pregnant Women in The United States.

"BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to organophosphate (OP) pesticide neurotoxicity may be greatest during the prenatal period; however, previous studies have produced mixed findings concerning in utero OP pesticide exposure and child cognition. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine whether maternal urinary concentrations of OP pesticide metabolites are inversely associated with child nonverbal IQ at 6 y of age and to examine potential effect measure modification by the PON1 gene. METHODS: Data came from 708 mother-child pairs participating in the Generation R Study. Maternal urine concentrations of six dialkylphosphates (DAPs), collected at [Formula: see text], 18-25, and [Formula: see text] of gestation, were determined. Child nonverbal IQ was measured at 6 y of age using the Mosaics and Categories subtests from the Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test-Revised. PON1 was determined in cord blood for 474 infants. Multiple linear regression models were fit to estimate the DAP-IQ associations and PON1 interactions. RESULTS: Overall, associations between child nonverbal IQ and maternal DAP concentrations were small and imprecise, and these associations were inconsistent across urine sampling periods. Howover, for a 10-fold difference in total DAP concentration for the [Formula: see text] of gestation samples, adjusted child nonverbal IQ was 3.9 points lower (95% CI: [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]). Heterogeneity in the DAP-IQ association by PON1 gene allele status was not observed ([Formula: see text]). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent evidence of an association between higher maternal urinary DAP concentrations and lower child IQ scores at 6 y of age was not observed. There was some evidence for an inverse relation of child nonverbal IQ and late pregnancy urinary DAPs, but the estimated association was imprecise. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3024.",Organophosphate Pesticide Metabolite Concentrations in Urine during Pregnancy and Offspring Nonverbal IQ at Age 6 Years.
"This study aims to present and discuss acute Head Injury (HI) presentations including etiology, referral patterns and disposition in patients presenting to a major referral hospital in Gaborone, Botswana. Cross-sectional, retrospective data collection from July 2015 through September 2015 extracted descriptions of patient demographics, mechanism of injury, comorbidities, diagnosis and disposition from Emergency Centre (EC) records. 360 HI patients presented in three months, averaging four per day and increasing on weekends and end of the month. HI disproportionately impacted young adult males, with motor vehicle accidents accounting for 38%, violence implicated in 39% and 80% recorded as blunt trauma. HIV status was unknown for 84% of patients at the time of presentation and 10% of patients were recorded as HIV positive. Patients referred from external hospitals had a higher admission rate. HI in young males is a significant trauma burden in this hospital, similar to the known regional trauma patterns.

"BACKGROUND: The current incidence of major complications in paediatric craniofacial surgery in North America has not been accurately defined. In this report, the Pediatric Craniofacial Collaborative Group evaluates the incidence and determines the independent predictors of major perioperative complications using a multicentre database. METHODS: The Pediatric Craniofacial Surgery Perioperative Registry was queried for subjects undergoing complex cranial vault reconstruction surgery over a 5-year period. Major perioperative complications were identified through a structured a priori consensus process. Logistic regression was applied to identify predictors of a major perioperative complication with bootstrapping to evaluate discrimination accuracy and provide internal validity of the multivariable model. RESULTS: A total of 1814 patients from 33 institutions in the US and Canada were analysed; 15% were reported to have a major perioperative complication. Multivariable predictors included ASA physical status 3 or 4 (P=0.005), craniofacial syndrome (P=0.008), antifibrinolytic administered (P=0.003), blood product transfusion >50 ml kg(-1) (P<0.001), and surgery duration over 5 h (P<0.001). Bootstrapping indicated that the predictive algorithm had good internal validity and excellent discrimination and model performance. A perioperative complication was estimated to increase the hospital length of stay by an average of 3 days (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The predictive algorithm can be used as a prognostic tool to risk stratify patients and thereby potentially reduce morbidity and mortality. Craniofacial teams can utilise these predictors of complications to identify high-risk patients. Based on this information, further prospective quality improvement initiatives may decrease complications, and reduce morbidity and mortality.",Predictors of perioperative complications in paediatric cranial vault reconstruction surgery: a multicentre observational study from the Pediatric Craniofacial Collaborative Group.
"The vesicular monoamine transporter is involved in presynaptic catecholamine storage and neurotransmission. Two isoforms of the transporter exist, VMAT1 and VMAT2, and both are. expressed in the brain, though VMAT2 expression is more robust and has been more widely studied. In this study we investigated the role of VMAT1 KO on markers of dopaminergic function and neurotransmission, and dopamine-related behaviors. Null-mutant VMAT1 mice were studied behaviorally using the tail suspension test, elevated zero maze and locomotor activity assessments. Tissue monoamines were measured both ex vivo and by using in vivo microdialysis. Protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and D2 dopamine receptors was measured using western blot analysis. Results show that VMAT1 KO mice have decreased dopamine levels in the frontal cortex, increased postsynaptic D2 expression, and lower frontal cortex tyrosine hydroxylase expression compared to WT mice. VMAT1 KO mice also show an exaggerated behavioral locomotor response to acute amphetamine treatment. We conclude that dopaminergic signaling is robustly altered in the frontal cortex of VMAT1 null-mutant mice and suggest that VMAT1 may be relevant to the pathogenesis and/or treatment of psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia and bipolar disease.",Deletion of the vesicular monoamine transporter 1 (vmat1/slc18a1) gene affects dopamine signaling.
"PURPOSE: Shoulder dystocia is the strongest known risk factor for brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP). Fractures of the clavicle are known to occur in the setting of shoulder dystocia. It remains unknown whether a clavicle fracture that occurs during a birth delivery with shoulder dystocia increases the risk of BPBP or, alternatively, is protective. The purpose of this study was to use a large, national database to determine whether a clavicle fracture in the setting of shoulder dystocia is associated with an increased or decreased risk of BPBP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 1997 to 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) was analyzed for this study. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes were used to identify newborns diagnosed with shoulder dystocia and BPBP as well as a concurrent fracture of the clavicle. Newborns with shoulder dystocia were stratified into 2 groups: dystocia without a clavicle fracture and dystocia with a clavicle fracture. Multivariable logistic regression was used to quantify the risk for BPBP among shoulder dystocia subgroups. RESULTS: The dataset included 5,564,628 sample births extrapolated to 23,385,597 population births over the 16-year study period. A BPBP occurred at a rate of 1.2 per 1,000 births. Shoulder dystocia complicated 18.8% of births with a BPBP. A total of 7.84% of newborns with a BPBP also sustained a clavicle fracture. Births with shoulder dystocia and a clavicle fracture incurred BPBP at a rate similar to that for newborns with shoulder dystocia and no fracture (9.82% vs 11.77%). Shoulder dystocia without a concurrent clavicle fracture was an independent risk factor for BPBP (odds ratio, 112.1; 95% confidence interval, 103.5-121.4). Those with shoulder dystocia and clavicle fracture had a risk for BPBP comparable with those with shoulder dystocia but no fracture (odds ratio, 126.7 vs 112.1). CONCLUSIONS: This population-level investigation suggests that, among newborns with shoulder dystocia, clavicle fracture is not associated with a significant change in the risk of BPBP.

"INTRODUCTION: There is not a structured algorithm, timeline, or resource on how, when, and which programs are looking for a new staff pediatric urologist. We hypothesized that current and future pediatric urology fellows could benefit from the experiences of recently graduated fellows on navigating the urology job market. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to survey current and recent pediatric urology fellowship graduates about the process of finding their first job. STUDY DESIGN: A Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) online survey was designed and distributed through email to current fellows and 2012-2017 graduates. Results were evaluated using STATA. RESULTS: 153 participants were emailed, and 94 (61%) completed the survey. The plurality of applicants (44%) began the job search at the Spring American Urological Association meeting, 14 months before finishing (Figure). Of those who started 14 months before finishing, 33% wished they started earlier and 61% would have started at the same point. The median number of programs contacted for a position was 3-4 and the median number of programs visited and offers received was two. After the offer, 40% reported having >8 weeks to decide. Less than half (38.5%) hired an attorney for contract negotiation. Of those who hired an attorney, 68% felt it provided benefit. Regarding contract negotiation, 22% did not negotiate and 35% negotiated for salary. Unsurprisingly, 28% of those who took academic jobs thought negotiating for protected research/educational time was most important compared with only 4% of those who took non-academic jobs (P = 0.02). When asked how they learned about the job they accepted: 28% were contacted by the program, 25% cold called the program, 30% accepted where they did residency or fellowship, and 18% learned through society websites. The plurality (50%) thought the number of desirable positions during the process were as they expected. 41% however, thought the number of desirable positions were expectedly or surprisingly low. Regarding quality of life and satisfaction with job/career choice, 98% stated that they would still choose to subspecialize in pediatric urology. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this survey should provide guidance to fellows on how to approach the job search with respect to timing, expectations, contract negotiation, and initial job satisfaction.",Uncharted territory: navigating the pediatric urology job market.
"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the use of wearable devices among the veteran population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate veterans' perceptions of and experiences with wearable devices and identify the potential barriers and opportunities to using such devices to increase physical activity levels in this population. METHODS: Veterans able to ambulate with or without assistance completed surveys about their mobile technology use and physical activity levels. They were then given the option of using a wearable device to monitor their activity levels. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted after 2 months. RESULTS: A total of 16 veterans were enrolled in this study, and all of them agreed to take home and use the wearable device to monitor their activity levels. At follow-up, 91% (10/11) veterans were still using the device daily. Veterans identified both opportunities and barriers for incorporating these devices into interventions to increase physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Veterans engaged in using wearable devices at high rates.",Barriers and Opportunities for Using Wearable Devices to Increase Physical Activity Among Veterans: Pilot Study.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this paper is to review current literature on the gut microbiome within the context of host response to surgery and subsequent risk of developing complications, particularly anastomotic leak. We provide background on the relationship between host and gut microbiota with description of the role of the intestinal mucus layer as an important regulator of host health. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite improvements in surgical technique and adherence to the tenets of creating a tension-free anastomosis with adequate blood flow, the surgical community has been unable to decrease rates of anastomotic leak using the current paradigm. Rather than adhere to empirical strategies of decontamination, it is imperative to focus on the interaction between the human host and the gut microbiota that live within us. The gut microbiome has been found to play a potential role in development of post-operative complications, including but not limited to anastomotic leak. Evidence suggests that peri-operative interventions may have a role in instigating or mitigating the impact of the gut microbiota via disruption of the protective mucus layer, use of multiple medications, and activation of virulence factors. The microbiome plays a potential role in the development of surgical complications and can be modulated by peri-operative interventions. As such, further research into this relationship is urgently needed.",The Microbiome-Host Interaction as a Potential Driver of Anastomotic Leak.

"This retrospective review of 33 children's dynamic 4-dimensional (4-D) computed tomography (CT) images of the airways, performed using volume scanning on a 320-detector array without anaesthesia (free-breathing) and 1.4-s continuous scanning, was undertaken to report technique, pitfalls, quality, radiation doses and findings. Tracheobronchomalacia (airway diameter collapse >28%) was recorded. Age-matched routine chest CT scans and bronchograms acted as benchmarks for comparing effective dose. Pitfalls included failure to administer intravenous contrast, pull back endotracheal tubes and/or remove nasogastric tubes. Twenty-two studies (67%) were diagnostic. Motion artefact was present in 16 (48%). Mean effective dose: dynamic 4-D CT 1.0 mSv; routine CT chest, 1.0 mSv, and bronchograms, 1.4 mSv. Dynamic 4-D CT showed tracheobronchomalacia in 20 patients (61%) and cardiovascular abnormalities in 12 (36%). Fourteen children (70%) with tracheobronchomalacia were managed successfully by optimising conservative management, 5 (25%) underwent surgical interventions and 1 (5%) died from the presenting disorder.","Technique, pitfalls, quality, radiation dose and findings of dynamic 4-dimensional computed tomography for airway imaging in infants and children."
"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been successfully used to deliver gene therapy to improve auditory function in mouse models of hereditary hearing loss. Many forms of hereditary hearing loss have mutations which affect the cochlear hair cells, the mechanosensory cells which allow for sound detection and processing. While most conventional AAVs infect inner hair cells (IHCs) with various efficiencies, they infect outer hair cells (OHCs) and supporting cells at lower levels in the cochlea. Here we examine the infection patterns of two synthetic AAVs (AAV2.7m8 and AAV8BP2) in the mouse inner ear. AAV2.7m8 infects both IHCs and OHCs with high efficiency. In addition, AAV2.7m8 infects inner pillar cells and inner phalangeal cells with high efficiency. Our results suggest that AAV2.7m8 is an excellent viral vector for inner ear gene therapy targeting cochlear hair cells and supporting cells, and it will likely greatly expand the potential applications for inner ear gene therapy.",AAV2.7m8 is a powerful viral vector for inner ear gene therapy.

"The molecular basis for the formation of functional, higher-ordered macro-molecular domains is not completely known. The Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) genome forms a super-molecular domain structure during latent infection that is strictly dependent on the DNA binding of the viral nuclear antigen LANA to the viral terminal repeats (TR). LANA is known to form oligomeric structures that have been implicated in viral episome maintenance. In this study, we show that the LANA oligomerization interface is required for the formation of higher-order nuclear bodies that partially colocalize with DAXX, EZH2, H3K27me3, and ORC2 but not with PML. These nuclear bodies assemble at the periphery of condensed cellular chromosomes during mitotic cell division. We demonstrate that the LANA oligomerization interface contributes to the cooperative DNA binding at the viral TR and the recruitment of ORC to the viral episome. Oligomerization mutants failed to auto-regulate LANA/ORF73 transcription, and this correlated with the loss of a chromosome conformational DNA-loop between the TR and LANA promoter. Viral genomes with LANA oligomerization mutants were subject to genome rearrangements including the loss of subgenomic DNA. Our data suggests that LANA oligomerization drives stable binding to the TR and formation of an epigenetically stable chromatin architecture resulting in higher-order LANA nuclear bodies important for viral genome integrity and long-term episome persistence.",LANA oligomeric architecture is essential for KSHV nuclear body formation and viral genome maintenance during latency.
"By describing an instance of racial violence by a patient against a resident physician, the authors hope to stimulate further discussion by addressing three specific questions about managing racist patients: (1) How should the resident (or any level of trainee) respond to the immediate situation?, (2) How should the unit respond to the event as a community?, and (3) How should the institution (hospital and/or academic institution) respond to the event? The authors argue that responses to such incidents should acknowledge the history of structural racism in U.S. society and in medicine. The authors recommend an approach that names the racism directly while addressing the safety of the patient and the providers in the moment, supports those affected in the aftermath, and considers appropriate consequences for the perpetrators of violence.","Confronting Racial Violence: Resident, Unit, and Institutional Responses."

"Following injury to the central nervous system, astrocytes perform critical and complex functions that both promote and antagonize neural repair. Understanding the molecular signaling pathways that coordinate their diverse functional properties is key to developing effective therapeutic strategies. In the healthy, adult CNS, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is active in mature, differentiated astrocytes. Shh has been shown to undergo injury-induced upregulation and promote neural repair. Here, we investigated whether Shh signaling mediates astrocyte response to injury. Surprisingly, we found that following an acute, focal injury, reactive astrocytes exhibit a pronounced reduction in Shh activity in a spatiotemporally-defined manner. Shh signaling is lost in reactive astrocytes at the lesion site, but persists in mild to moderately reactive astrocytes in distal tissues. Nevertheless, local pharmacological activation of the Shh pathway in astrocytes mitigates inflammation, consistent with a neuroprotective role for Shh signaling after injury. Interestingly, we find that Shh signaling is restored to baseline levels two weeks after injury, a time during which acute inflammation has largely subsided and lesions have matured. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenous Shh signaling in astrocytes is dynamically regulated in a context dependent manner. In addition, exogenous activation of the Shh pathway promotes neuroprotection mediated by reactive astrocytes.",Sonic hedgehog signaling is negatively regulated in reactive astrocytes after forebrain stab injury.
"Most patients with late-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) initially respond to chemotherapy but inevitably relapse and develop resistance, highlighting the need for novel therapies to improve patient outcomes. The MEK/ERK pathway is activated in a large subset of HGSOC, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Here, we systematically evaluated the extent of MEK/ERK pathway activation and efficacy of pathway inhibition in a large panel of well-annotated HGSOC patient-derived xenograft models. The vast majority of models were nonresponsive to the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib (GDC-0973) despite effective pathway inhibition. Proteomic analyses of adaptive responses to GDC-0973 revealed that GDC-0973 upregulated the proapoptotic protein BIM, thus priming the cells for apoptosis regulated by BCL2-family proteins. Indeed, combination of both MEK inhibitor and dual BCL-2/XL inhibitor (ABT-263) significantly reduced cell number, increased cell death, and displayed synergy in vitro in most models. In vivo, GDC-0973 and ABT-263 combination was well tolerated and resulted in greater tumor growth inhibition than single agents. Detailed proteomic and correlation analyses identified two subsets of responsive models-those with high BIM at baseline that was increased with MEK inhibition and those with low basal BIM and high pERK levels. Models with low BIM and low pERK were nonresponsive. Our findings demonstrate that combined MEK and BCL-2/XL inhibition has therapeutic activity in HGSOC models and provide a mechanistic rationale for the clinical evaluation of this drug combination as well as the assessment of the extent to which BIM and/or pERK levels predict drug combination effectiveness in chemoresistant HGSOC.",Combined MEK and BCL-2/XL Inhibition Is Effective in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Patient-Derived Xenograft Models and BIM Levels Are Predictive of Responsiveness.

"PURPOSE: The Urinary Tract Dilation classification system was designed to be more objective and reproducible than currently available grading systems. We evaluated the reliability and consistency of the system in newborns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 1,046 infants 0 to 90 days old undergoing ultrasound for hydronephrosis 243 were randomly selected for study inclusion. Seven readers (4 radiologists and 3 urologists) at 4 institutions classified complete, de-identified ultrasound studies on a Web based platform. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement was evaluated using the Fleiss kappa statistic. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for Urinary Tract Dilation risk score was moderate among the 7 readers (kappa = 0.421, 95% CI 0.404-0.438). Interobserver agreement using the Society for Fetal Urology scale was worse than with the Urinary Tract Dilation classification (kappa = 0.344, 95% CI 0.330-0.359). All 7 readers assigned the same Urinary Tract Dilation score in 19.3% of cases (47 of 243). In 38.7% of cases (94 of 243) at least 3 readers assigned a Urinary Tract Dilation score different from that assigned by the other readers. In 7% of cases (17 of 243) at least 3 readers assigned a score of P0/P1, while at least 3 readers scored the same cases as P2/P3. At least 3 different Urinary Tract Dilation risk scores were assigned to the same patient in 30.45% of patients (74 of 243). Among individual Urinary Tract Dilation elements calyceal dilatation and bladder status had the highest disagreement. Five readers regraded 80 cases and agreed with their previous Urinary Tract Dilation risk score in 57.5% to 75.0% of cases (kappa 0.432 to 0.729). CONCLUSIONS: Interobserver agreement using the Urinary Tract Dilation grading system is fair to moderate, with variable agreement on individual elements of the system.

"Purpose: This study aims to determine the effectiveness of an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program based on a Clinical Pathway (CP) to improve appropriateness in perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP). Materials and methods: This pre-post quasi-experimental study was conducted in a 12 month period (six months before and six months after CP implementation), in a tertiary Pediatric Surgical Centre. All patients from 1 month to 15 years of age receiving one or more surgical procedures were eligible for inclusion. PAP was defined appropriate according to clinical practice guidelines. Results: Seven hundred sixty-six children were included in the study, 394 in pre-intervention and 372 in post-intervention. After CP implementation, there was an increase in appropriate PAP administration, as well as in the selection of the appropriate antibiotic for prophylaxis, both for monotherapy (p = 0.02) and combination therapy (p = 0.004). Even the duration of prophylaxis decreased during the post-intervention period, with an increase of correct PAP discontinuation from 45.1 to 66.7% (p < 0.001). Despite the greater use of narrow-spectrum antibiotic for fewer days, there was no increase in treatment failures (10/394 (2.5%) pre vs 7/372 (1.9%) post, p = 0.54). Conclusions: CPs can be a useful tool to improve the choice of antibiotic and the duration of PAP in pediatric patients.",Effects of an antimicrobial stewardship intervention on perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in pediatrics.
"Protein dimerization and oligomerization are essential to most cellular functions, yet measurement of the size of these oligomers in live cells, especially when their size changes over time and space, remains a challenge. A commonly used approach for studying protein aggregates in cells is number and brightness (N&B), a fluorescence microscopy method that is capable of measuring the apparent average number of molecules and their oligomerization (brightness) in each pixel from a series of fluorescence microscopy images. We have recently expanded this approach in order to allow resampling of the raw data to resolve the statistical weighting of coexisting species within each pixel. This feature makes enhanced N&B (eN&B) optimal for capturing the temporal aspects of protein oligomerization when a distribution of oligomers shifts toward a larger central size over time. In this protocol, we demonstrate the application of eN&B by quantifying receptor clustering dynamics using electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD)-based total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF) imaging. TIRF provides a superior signal-to-noise ratio, but we also provide guidelines for implementing eN&B in confocal microscopes. For each time point, eN&B requires the acquisition of 200 frames, and it takes a few seconds up to 2 min to complete a single time point. We provide an eN&B (and standard N&B) MATLAB software package amenable to any standard confocal or TIRF microscope. The software requires a high-RAM computer (64 Gb) to run and includes a photobleaching detrending algorithm, which allows extension of the live imaging for more than an hour.",Using enhanced number and brightness to measure protein oligomerization dynamics in live cells.
": media-1vid110.1542/5972296743001PEDS-VA_2018-0496Video Abstract BACKGROUND: Developing a research agenda that is focused on the priorities of key stakeholders may expedite implementation and dissemination. Our objective was to identify the highest-priority patient-safety research topics among pediatric clinicians, health care leaders, and families. METHODS: The Children's Hospitals Solutions for Patient Safety Network is a network of >100 children's hospitals working together to eliminate harm due to health care. Parents and site leaders responded to an open-ended, anonymous e-mail survey used to elicit research topics. A key stakeholder panel winnowed related topics and prioritized topics using Likert scale ratings. Site leaders and parents responded to a second anonymous e-mail survey and rated the importance of each topic. Health system executive interviews were used to elicit their opinions regarding top priorities for patient-safety research. RESULTS: The elicitation survey had 107 respondents who produced 49 unique research topics. The key stakeholder panel developed a final list of 24 topics. The prioritization survey had 74 respondents. Top-priority research topics concerned high reliability, safety culture, open communication, and early detection of patient deterioration and sepsis. During 7 qualitative interviews, health system executives highlighted diagnostic error, medication safety, deterioration, and ambulatory patient safety as priority areas. CONCLUSIONS: With this study, we take a first step toward a stakeholder-driven research agenda on the basis of the assumption that stakeholders are best positioned to determine what research will be used to address the problems of most concern to them.",Priorities for Pediatric Patient Safety Research.
"Male germ cells of all placental mammals express an ancient nuclear RNA binding protein of unknown function called RBMXL2. Here we find that deletion of the retrogene encoding RBMXL2 blocks spermatogenesis. Transcriptome analyses of age-matched deletion mice show that RBMXL2 controls splicing patterns during meiosis. In particular, RBMXL2 represses the selection of aberrant splice sites and the insertion of cryptic and premature terminal exons. Our data suggest a Rbmxl2 retrogene has been conserved across mammals as part of a splicing control mechanism that is fundamentally important to germ cell biology. We propose that this mechanism is essential to meiosis because it buffers the high ambient concentrations of splicing activators, thereby preventing poisoning of key transcripts and disruption to gene expression by aberrant splice site selection.",An ancient germ cell-specific RNA-binding protein protects the germline from cryptic splice site poisoning.

"OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate trends over time in computed tomography (CT) scan utilization after implementation of a clinical pathway in a tertiary care children's hospital emergency department (ED), to determine how ED throughput differs by CT utilization, and to determine provider reasoning for obtaining head CT in low-risk patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients 21 years or younger discharged from our ED with head trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale score >/=13 and a head trauma International Classification of Diseases code) over a 5-year period, starting 1 year after pathway implementation (January 2012 to December 2016). A manual chart review of 10% of patients who received a CT was performed to determine reasoning for CT utilization and guideline compliance. RESULTS: In total, 6.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9%-6.6%) of 21,129 discharged patients received a head CT, decreasing annually by an average of 0.9%. Pediatricians were more likely to obtain a CT than pediatric emergency medicine physicians after adjusting for acuity (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.02-1.82). Those who received a CT stayed 90 minutes longer (95% CI, 79-101 minutes) than those who did not after propensity score matching. Thirty percent of patients who received a CT in our manual chart review met low-risk Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Head CT rates in patients with minor head trauma consistently decreased each year after guideline implementation. Children who received head CT did not have prolonged lengths of stay compared with those who did not. A minority of patients who received a CT and were discharged met low-risk criteria by standardized guidelines.",Trends in Emergent Head Computed Tomography Utilization for Minor Head Trauma After Implementation of a Clinical Pathway.
"Outcomes of pediatric and young adult patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved significantly in the past few decades. Treatment advances have provided 5-year survival rates ranging from 78 to 91% depending on the age at diagnosis. However, approximately 2-3% of patients will present with refractory disease that is unresponsive to chemotherapy, and 10-15% of patients will relapse. Outcomes post-relapse show significantly reduced 5-year survival rates that continue to decrease with each subsequent relapse. Despite our increased understanding of risk factors and disease predictors, treatment strategies for patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease, including variations of chemotherapy and stem cell transplant, remain ineffective for many patients. To improve outcomes of patients with r/r disease, immunotherapies targeting specific B cell antigens are being developed. Tisagenlecleucel is an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with refractory leukemia or those with second or later relapse. In this treatment strategy, a patient's own T cells are transduced to express an anti-CD19 CAR that, when reintroduced into the patient, directs specific binding and killing of CD19+ B cells. In a phase 2, single-arm, multicenter, global study, tisagenlecleucel resulted in a remission rate of 81% in pediatric and adolescent patients with r/r B cell ALL. This review article summarizes four typical cases of pediatric and adolescent r/r B-cell ALL, focusing on the patient's journey from initial diagnosis to treatment with CAR T cell therapy.",The journey to CAR T cell therapy: the pediatric and young adult experience with relapsed or refractory B-ALL.
"OBJECTIVE: Exercise and sleep are two important health promoting behaviors, but large parts of the population do not exercise or are chronically sleep deprived. We investigated to what degree exercise and sleep compete with each other and with other waking activities for time. METHODS: Analyses are based on 2003-2016 American Time Use Survey data of a representative sample of N = 47,862 working Americans aged 18-65 years interviewed on weekdays. Models were adjusted for various sociodemographic variables and time spent working on the interview day. RESULTS: Long work hours and several sociodemographic variables were associated both with short sleep and low exercise rates. Respondents who exercised slept on average 15.5 min less (95% CI: -18.4 min; -12.7 min, P < .0001) than those who did not exercise. Sleep duration decreased with exercise duration in a dose-dependent manner. The strongest association between exercise and sleep duration was observed for exercise between 6 AM and 8 AM (ie, before work) and between 9 PM and 11 PM (ie, before bed). However, unless exercise was performed before work in the morning, exercise durations of up to 1 h were not associated with relevantly curtailed sleep. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that exercise and sleep compete with each other for time. However, exercise regimens that follow current guidelines are unlikely to curtail sleep substantially, especially since exercise has been shown to positively affect sleep structure and quality. Public health efforts should nevertheless emphasize the importance of both exercise and sleep, and of not sacrificing one activity for the other.",Healthy behaviors competing for time: associations of sleep and exercise in working Americans.
"Gene-editing using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is promising as a potential therapeutic strategy for many genetic disorders. CRISPR-based therapies are already being assessed in clinical trials, and evaluation of this technology in Fragile X syndrome has been performed by a number of groups. The findings from these studies and the advancement of CRISPR-based technologies are insightful as the field continues towards treatments and cures of Fragile X-Associated Disorders (FXADs). In this review, we summarize reports using CRISPR-editing strategies to target Fragile X syndrome (FXS) molecular dysregulation, and highlight how differences in FXS and Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) might alter treatment strategies for each syndrome. We discuss the various modifications and evolutions of the CRISPR toolkit that expand its therapeutic potential, and other considerations for moving these strategies from bench to bedside. The rapidly growing field of CRISPR therapeutics is providing a myriad of approaches to target a gene, pathway, or transcript for modification. As cures for FXADs have remained elusive, CRISPR opens new avenues to pursue.",CRISPR to the Rescue: Advances in Gene Editing for the FMR1 Gene.
"Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD) is a macular degeneration caused by mutations in TIMP3, the majority of which introduce a novel cysteine. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying SFD remain unknown. We aimed to provide novel insights into the functional consequences of a distinct N-terminal mutation. Haplotype reconstruction in three SFD families revealed that the identified c.113C>G, p.(Ser38Cys) mutation is a founder in Belgian and northern French families with a late-onset SFD phenotype. Functional consequences of the p.(Ser38Cys) mutation were investigated by high-resolution Western blot analysis of wild type and mutant TIMP3 using patient fibroblasts and in vitro generated proteins, and by molecular modeling of TIMP3 and its interaction partners. We could not confirm a previous hypothesis on dimerization of mutant TIMP3 proteins. However, we identified aberrant intramolecular disulfide bonding. Our data provide evidence for disruption of the established Cys36-Cys143 disulfide bond and formation of a novel Cys36-Cys38 bond, possibly associated with increased glycosylation of the protein. In conclusion, we propose a novel pathogenetic mechanism underlying the p.(Ser38Cys) TIMP3 founder mutation involving intramolecular disulfide bonding. These results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SFD and other retinopathies linked to mutations in TIMP3, such as age-related macular degeneration.",The N-terminal p.(Ser38Cys) TIMP3 mutation underlying Sorsby fundus dystrophy is a founder mutation disrupting an intramolecular disulfide bond.

"PARP inhibitors (PARPis) have remarkable antitumor activity in BRCA mutant ovarian carcinoma. Emerging evidence has shown that responses to PARPis are not limited to BRCA mutant tumors, but could expand to other homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) carcinomas. However, relatively little is known about the efficacy of PARPis in patients with HRD when compared to non-HRD carriers. In this systematic review, 13 clinical trials were included and analyzed for the treatment effect of PARPis on progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for HRD (BRCA mutant HRD, n = 697; BRCA wild-type HRD, n = 478) vs. non-HRD (n = 1,417) patients. Pooled analyses of the effect of PARPis in both ovarian and nonovarian carcinoma groups showed significantly higher PFS rates at 6 months and 12 months (PFS6 and PFS12) in the HRD subgroup, as compared to the non-HRD subgroup. Within the HRD subgroup, the BRCA-mutant population achieved significantly higher PFS6 (OR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.03-5.08) and PFS12 (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.26-3.01) when compared to BRCA wild-type patients. Furthermore, within BRCA wild-type carcinomas, mutations in other HRD-related genes also led to increased PFS6 (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.27-2.43) and PFS12 (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.31-2.62), as compared to non-HRD counterparts. Therefore, patients with HRD carcinomas exhibited pronounced PFS advantages upon treatment with PARPis, as compared to non-HRD carcinomas. In addition to BRCA mutations, other non-BRCA HRD-related aberrations may serve as novel biomarkers for the prediction of PARPi efficacy.",Antitumor efficacy of PARP inhibitors in homologous recombination deficient carcinomas.
"T cells engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have emerged as a potent new class of therapeutics for cancer, based on their remarkable potency in blood cancers. Since the first clinical reports of their efficacy emerged 7 years ago, investigators have focused on the mechanisms and properties that make CARs effective or toxic, and their effects on T cell biology.

"OBJECTIVE: Pediatric aerodigestive programs appear to be rapidly proliferating and provide multi-disciplinary, coordinated care to complex, medically-fragile children. Pediatric subspecialists are considered essential to these programs. This study evaluated the state of these programs in 2017 by surveying their size, composition, prevalence, and the number of patients that they serve. METHODS: The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition Aerodigestive Special Interest Group leadership distributed an 11-question survey to the Pediatric Gastroenterology International Listserv. The mean time of the programs' existence, number of half-day clinics, number of procedure days, number of patients evaluated and the lead primary specialty were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-four programs responded. Twenty-five were based in academic centers. 31 programs were located across the United States. The average time of program existence was 5.3 years (SD 4.3 range 1-17 years). 64.7% were started in the past five years. Twelve programs were based in the division of gastroenterology. The average number of gastroenterologists serving aerodigestive programs was 2 (SD 1.1). The mean number of half-day clinic sessions and procedure days were 2.8 (SD 2.9) and 2.6 (SD 2) respectively. New and follow-up visits per year in each program averaged 184 (SD 168, range 10-750). CONCLUSION: Pediatric aerodigestive programs are prevalent, proliferating, and serve a large number of complex patients across North America and the world. This survey demonstrated that programs are predominantly based in academic settings. The number of patients cared for by aerodigestive centers varies widely depending on size and age of program.",Size and Prevalence of Pediatric Aerodigestive Programs in 2017.
"BACKGROUND: Neurogastroenterology and motility (NGM) disorders are common and have a high health care burden. Although pediatric gastroenterology fellows are expected to obtain comprehensive training in the diagnosis and management of NGM disorders, there is ongoing concern for unmet training needs and lack of exposure in treating patients who suffer from NGM problems. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-section survey of trainees listed as pediatric gastroenterology fellows in North American training programs in 2018 via direct E-mail and the pediatric gastroenterology listserv. Eighty-one pediatric gastroenterology fellows responded to the anonymous survey. RESULTS: A total of 53.1% of the fellows reported interest in NGM, however, 75.1% of the fellows believed they had not been adequately trained in NGM during their fellowship. Eighty percent of fellows with two weeks or less of dedicated motility training reported that they received inadequate NGM training, compared to 46.2% fellows who received one or more months of dedicated motility training (p = 0.0148). The majority of fellows reported not being comfortable in performing gastrointestinal (GI) motility studies. The majority of fellows also reported not being comfortable in interpreting GI motility studies. CONCLUSION: While most pediatric gastroenterology fellows expressed interest in NGM, the lack of exposure and dedicated training in motility during fellowship were identified as barriers to pursuing motility-focused careers. Furthermore, most fellows reported limited comfort with performing and/or interpreting motility studies. Changes are needed to encourage fellows to develop their interest and expertise in NGM.",Barriers in Neurogastroenterology and Motility Training Experience for Pediatric Gastroenterology Fellows.
"OBJECTIVES: Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive neonatal fibroinflammatory cholangiopathy. We hypothesized that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) would be safe, feasible, acceptable, and efficacious for the treatment of BA. The primary objective of this study was to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and safety profile of IVIg administration after hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) in BA. The secondary objective was to determine the treatment efficacy of IVIg based on good bile drainage and survival with the native liver. METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, phase I/IIA trial of IVIg was conducted, with 1 g/kg/dose of IVIg infused at 3-5, 30, and 60 days post-HPE, and subjects followed for 360 days post-HPE. Twenty-nine participants completed the study. RESULTS: Administration of IVIg infusions was feasible and acceptable in 79%. None of the serious adverse events (SAEs) were directly related to IVIg infusions; however, 90% of participants had an SAE. Compared with a historical placebo-arm group, there was no significant increase in the proportion of IVIg participants with a serum total bilirubin <1.5 mg/dL at 90, 180, or 360 days post-HPE. Survival with the native liver in the IVIg participants showed no significant benefit over the historical placebo arm, with a difference at 360 days of -11.9% (IVIg: 58.6%, placebo: 70.5%; 90% UCB: 2.1%; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although IVIg infusions in infants with BA post-HPE were feasible, acceptable and safe, there was no trend to lower bilirubin levels or improved 360-day survival with the native liver.

"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common autoimmune cytopenia in children. Approximately, 25% of patients develop chronic disease, which may be unpredictable and challenging to treat. It is not currently possible to predict at the time of presentation which patients will have chronic disease or will experience symptoms requiring second-line therapy defined as treatment beyond corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or Rh immune globulin. A multi-institutional retrospective review of 311 pediatric patients with ITP was performed with the goal of identifying clinical characteristics associated with disease course. In a cohort of 216 patients tested and for whom disease status was known, a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was associated with chronic ITP vs spontaneous resolution of disease (29.2% vs 8.1%, P < 0.001) as well as the need for treatment with second line agents (38.5% vs 11.4%, P < 0.001) in 241 patients. Controlling for the effect of Evans syndrome, defined as having two immune cytopenias, a positive DAT was independently associated with chronic ITP (OR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.0-7.2, P = 0.041) and use of second-line agents (OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.7-7.7, P = 0.001) by multivariate logistic regression model. These findings demonstrate an association with positive DAT and chronic disease, as well as refractory disease requiring second-line agents.",Association of a positive direct antiglobulin test with chronic immune thrombocytopenia and use of second line therapies in children: A multi-institutional review.
"Sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) are a useful and increasingly popular approach for gathering information to inform the construction of adaptive interventions to treat psychological and behavioral health conditions. Until recently, analysis methods for data from SMART designs considered only a single measurement of the outcome of interest when comparing the efficacy of adaptive interventions. Lu et al. proposed a method for considering repeated outcome measurements to incorporate information about the longitudinal trajectory of change. While their proposed method can be applied to many kinds of outcome variables, they focused mainly on linear models for normally distributed outcomes. Practical guidelines and extensions are required to implement this methodology with other types of repeated outcome measures common in behavioral research. In this article, we discuss implementation of this method with repeated binary outcomes. We explain how to compare adaptive interventions in terms of various summaries of repeated binary outcome measures, including average outcome (area under the curve) and delayed effects. The method is illustrated using an empirical example from a SMART study to develop an adaptive intervention for engaging alcohol- and cocaine-dependent patients in treatment. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed technique.",A Data Analysis Method for Using Longitudinal Binary Outcome Data from a SMART to Compare Adaptive Interventions.
"SOX4, together with SOX11 and SOX12, forms group C of SRY-related (SOX) transcription factors. They play key roles, often in redundancy, in multiple developmental pathways, including neurogenesis and skeletogenesis. De novo SOX11 heterozygous mutations have been shown to cause intellectual disability, growth deficiency, and dysmorphic features compatible with mild Coffin-Siris syndrome. Using trio-based exome sequencing, we here identify de novo SOX4 heterozygous missense variants in four children who share developmental delay, intellectual disability, and mild facial and digital morphological abnormalities. SOX4 is highly expressed in areas of active neurogenesis in human fetuses, and sox4 knockdown in Xenopus embryos diminishes brain and whole-body size. The SOX4 variants cluster in the highly conserved, SOX family-specific HMG domain, but each alters a different residue. In silico tools predict that each variant affects a distinct structural feature of this DNA-binding domain, and functional assays demonstrate that these SOX4 proteins carrying these variants are unable to bind DNA in vitro and transactivate SOX reporter genes in cultured cells. These variants are not found in the gnomAD database of individuals with presumably normal development, but 12 other SOX4 HMG-domain missense variants are recorded and all demonstrate partial to full activity in the reporter assay. Taken together, these findings point to specific SOX4 HMG-domain missense variants as the cause of a characteristic human neurodevelopmental disorder associated with mild facial and digital dysmorphism.",De Novo SOX4 Variants Cause a Neurodevelopmental Disease Associated with Mild Dysmorphism.

"Children and adolescents with renal disease experience daily social, emotional, and medical challenges. Renal transplantation can help to improve quality of life but requires a lifelong regimen of immunosuppressant medication to maintain health. Adherence to a daily complex regimen can be difficult, particularly for adolescents who are beginning to develop autonomy from caregivers and are faced with a unique set of socio-emotional challenges. This study examines two factors that have shown to influence adherence in other pediatric populations, namely family functioning and parent health locus of control, from mothers' perspectives, in predicting medication non-adherence for adolescents (ages 12-19 years) 1 year post-transplant. Non-adherence was defined as the percentage of missed doses and late doses of the weekly immunosuppressant doses prescribed. Regression results demonstrated that mothers' perceptions of poorer overall family functioning predicted missed medication doses (DeltaR(2) = 0.383, F(7, 21) = 2.570, P = 0.044) with significant contributions in the domains of problem-solving (beta = -0.795, t(21) = -2.927, P = 0.008) and affective involvement (beta = 0.872, t(21) = 3.370, P = 0.003). Moreover, mothers who perceived that their adolescent had control over his/her health also predicted more missed medication doses (DeltaR(2) = 0.133, F(1, 27) = 5.155, P = 0.031). Important implications for these findings include implementation of family-based interventions that promote developmentally appropriate skills for adolescents and cultivate emotional involvement within the family.",Medication adherence in pediatric renal transplant patients: The role of family functioning and parent health locus of control.
"Rim2 is an unusual mitochondrial carrier protein capable of transporting both iron and pyrimidine nucleotides. Here we characterize two point mutations generated in the predicted substrate-binding site, finding that they yield disparate effects on iron and pyrimidine transport. The Rim2 (E248A) mutant was deficient in mitochondrial iron transport activity. By contrast, the Rim2 (K299A) mutant specifically abrogated pyrimidine nucleotide transport and exchange, while leaving iron transport activity largely unaffected. Strikingly, E248A preserved TTP/TTP homoexchange but interfered with TTP/TMP heteroexchange, perhaps because proton coupling was dependent on the E248 acidic residue. Rim2-dependent iron transport was unaffected by pyrimidine nucleotides. Rim2-dependent pyrimidine transport was competed by Zn(2+) but not by Fe(2+), Fe(3+) or Cu(2+). The iron and pyrimidine nucleotide transport processes displayed different salt requirements; pyrimidine transport was dependent on the salt content of the buffer whereas iron transport was salt independent. In mitochondria containing Rim2 (E248A), iron proteins were decreased, including aconitase (Fe-S), pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoic acid containing) and cytochrome c (heme protein). Additionally, the rate of Fe-S cluster synthesis in isolated and intact mitochondria was decreased compared with the K299A mutant, consistent with the impairment of iron-dependent functions in that mutant. In summary, mitochondrial iron transport and pyrimidine transport by Rim2 occur separately and independently. Rim2 could be a bifunctional carrier protein.","Splitting the functions of Rim2, a mitochondrial iron/pyrimidine carrier."
"BACKGROUND: Viral suppression among HIV-positive individuals is essential for protecting health and preventing HIV transmission. Financial incentives have shown promise in modifying various health behaviours in low-income countries but few studies have assessed whether they can improve HIV treatment outcomes. We aimed to determine the impact of time-limited financial incentives on viral suppression among HIV-positive adults in rural Uganda. METHODS: We did a randomised controlled trial in four rural Ugandan parishes. We recruited HIV-positive individuals (aged >/=18 years) from community health campaigns that included HIV testing services or at a local government health facility where HIV treatment is offered. Participants included those who were initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) or already receiving ART. Eligibility to participate in the study did not depend on current ART or viral suppression status. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to the financial incentive intervention or the control group in computer-generated blocks (block size 10 participants) and pre-printed scratch cards were used to reveal study group assignment. We measured participants' viral load at baseline and at weeks 6, 12, 24, and 48. At each timepoint, we provided results and viral load counselling. Participants in the intervention group received financial incentives for viral suppression at weeks 6, 12, and 24, with incentive amounts increasing from US$4 to $12.5. The primary outcome was viral suppression (viral load <400 copies per mL) at 24 weeks in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02890459. FINDINGS: Between June 27, 2016, and May 25, 2018, we enrolled 400 adults in the study, of whom 203 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 197 to the control group. Of these, 324 were enrolled from community health campaigns and 76 from the government clinic. Eight (2%) withdrew from the study and were not included in analyses. Over the 48-week follow-up period, 35 (9%) died or were lost-to-follow-up. Participants' median daily income was $0.79. At baseline, 300 participants (77%) were virally suppressed. In intention-to-treat analyses, 168 participants (84%) in the intervention group and 156 (82%) in the control group were virally suppressed at 24 weeks (odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.68-1.93, p=0.62). Six participants (3%) in the control group and four (2%) in the intervention group had adverse events. Six of the adverse events were serious, including two deaths in the intervention group, three deaths in the control group, and one serious injury (tibia fracture) after an auto accident. No adverse events or deaths were related to study participation. INTERPRETATION: Financial incentives had no effect on viral suppression among HIV-positive adults. High baseline viral suppression and provision of viral load results might have contributed to high viral suppression among participants. These findings highlight the need for interventions that promote achievement of viral suppression among unsuppressed individuals.

"PURPOSE: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is widely used in the treatment of head and neck cancers (HNC). There is not enough evidence to suggest that some radiation oncologists (ROs) are associated with better outcomes in patients with HNC. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to evaluate the effect of ROs' characteristics on outcomes in patients with HNC treated with IMRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study used the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database to identify patient characteristics. Physician records were obtained from the American Medical Association. Logistic regression models with propensity scores were analyzed to look for an association between RO characteristics and patient outcomes. RESULTS: RO characteristics showed that approximately 30% of ROS completed their training in or after the year 2000 (recently trained), and 17% were in top decile of treatment volume (high volume). Less than 3% of ROs work in academic settings. We found that ROs who were recently trained have higher odds (odds ratio [OR]: 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.011-1.191) compared with those who were not. In addition, ROs who were treating high volumes of patients have higher odds (OR: 1.08; 95% CI, 1.010-1.165) compared with those treating low volumes of an event of adverse effect of IMRT or death among patients. ROs who work in academic settings have a protective effect (OR: 0.72; 95% CI, 0.569-0.925). CONCLUSIONS: ROs who were recently trained and had a high treatment volume are associated with poorer outcomes among patients with HNC who receive IMRT treatment.",Radiation Oncologist Characteristics and their Association with Outcomes in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer.

"Hierarchical condition categories (HCCs) are groups of diagnostic codes that are used to adjust federal payments to insurers and health systems based on differences in expected spending. Risk models built on HCCs improve on previous adjustment strategies that used demographic characteristics but did not include clinical diagnoses. Thus, accurate coding by clinicians of inpatient and outpatient encounters ensures capitated payments and reimbursements that are commensurate with predicted expenditures. Pulmonary diseases and various forms of critical illness play a significant role in this risk adjustment process both through their associated HCC codes and through interactions with other risk categories representing cardiac and psychiatric diseases. Ongoing uncertainty in federal health policy ensures a changing role for HCCs and risk-adjusted reimbursements across a variety of payment models and federal programs.",Hierarchical Condition Categories for Pulmonary Diseases: Population Health Management and Policy Opportunities.
"INTRODUCTION: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a two-step treatment involving the administration of a photosensitive agent followed by its activation at a specific light wavelength for targeting of tumor cells. MATERIALS/METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed to analyze the indications for PDT, mechanisms of action, use of different photosensitizers, the immunomodulatory effects of PDT, and both preclinical and clinical studies for use in high-grade gliomas (HGGs). RESULTS: PDT has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of premalignant and malignant diseases, such as actinic keratoses, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal cancers, and endobronchial non-small cell lung cancers, as well as for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization. In neuro-oncology, clinical trials are currently underway to demonstrate PDT efficacy against a number of malignancies that include HGGs and other brain tumors. Both photosensitizers and photosensitizing precursors have been used for PDT. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), an intermediate in the heme synthesis pathway, is a photosensitizing precursor with FDA approval for PDT of actinic keratosis and as an intraoperative imaging agent for fluorescence-guided visualization of malignant tissue during glioma surgery. New trials are underway to utilize 5-ALA as a therapeutic agent for PDT of the intraoperative resection cavity and interstitial PDT for inoperable HGGs. CONCLUSION: PDT remains a promising therapeutic approach that requires further study in HGGs. Use of 5-ALA PDT permits selective tumor targeting due to the intracellular metabolism of 5-ALA. The immunomodulatory effects of PDT further strengthen its use for treatment of HGGs and requires a better understanding. The combination of PDT with adjuvant therapies for HGGs will need to be studied in randomized, controlled studies.",5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy for the treatment of high-grade gliomas.
"Objectives To identify factors predicting maternal sex steroid hormone concentrations in early pregnancy. Methods The Infant Development and the Environment Study recruited healthy pregnant women from academic medical centers in four US cities. Gold standard liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure maternal sex steroids concentrations (total testosterone [TT], free testosterone [FT], estrone [E1], estradiol [E2], and estriol [E3] concentrations) in serum samples from 548 women carrying singletons (median = 11.7 weeks gestation). Women completed questionnaires on demographic and lifestyle characteristics. Results In multivariable linear regression analyses, hormone concentrations varied in relation to maternal age, body mass index (BMI), race, and parity. Older mothers had significantly lower levels of most hormones; for every year increase in maternal age, there was a 1-2% decrease in E1, E2, TT, and FT. By contrast, each unit increase in maternal BMI was associated 1-2% lower estrogen (E1, E2, E3) levels, but 1-2% higher androgen (TT, FT) concentrations. Hormone concentrations were 4-18% lower among parous women, and for each year elapsed since last birth, TT and FT were 1-2% higher (no difference in estrogens). Androgen concentrations were 18-30% higher among Black women compared to women of other races. Fetal sex, maternal stress, and lifestyle factors (including alcohol and tobacco use) were not related to maternal steroid concentrations. Conclusions for Practice Maternal demographic factors predict sex steroid hormone concentrations during pregnancy, which is important given increasing evidence that the prenatal endocrine environment shapes future risk of chronic disease for both mother and offspring.",Predictors of Steroid Hormone Concentrations in Early Pregnancy: Results from a Multi-Center Cohort.
"BACKGROUND: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is a common but unproven management strategy in paediatric critical care. Oscillator settings have been traditionally guided by patient age and/or weight rather than by lung mechanics, thereby potentially negating any beneficial effects. We have adopted an open-lung HFOV strategy based on a corner frequency approach using an initial incremental-decremental mean airway pressure titration manoeuvre, a high frequency (8-15 Hz), and high power to initially target a proximal pressure amplitude (Pproximal) of 70-90 cm H2O, irrespective of age or weight. METHODS: We reviewed prospectively collected data on patients < 18 years of age who were managed with HFOV for acute respiratory failure. We measured metrics for oxygenation, ventilation, and haemodynamics as well as the use of sedative-analgesic medications and neuromuscular blocking agents. RESULTS: Data from 115 non-cardiac patients were analysed, of whom 53 had moderate-to-severe paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). Sixteen patients (13.9%) died. Frequencies>/= 8 Hz and high Pproximal were achieved in all patients irrespective of age or PARDS severity. Patients with severe PARDS showed the greatest improvement in oxygenation. pH and PaCO2 normalized in all patients. Haemodynamic parameters, cumulative amount of fluid challenges, and daily fluid balance did not deteriorate after transitioning to HFOV in any age or PARDS severity group. We observed a transient increase neuromuscular blocking agent use after switching to HFOV, but there was no increase in the daily cumulative amount of continuous midazolam or morphine in any age or PARDS severity group. No patients experienced clinically apparent barotrauma. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting the feasibility of an alternative, individualized, physiology-based open-lung HFOV strategy targeting high F and high Pproximal. No adverse effects were observed with this strategy. Our findings warrant further systematic evaluation.","Feasibility of an alternative, physiologic, individualized open-lung approach to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in children."
"Early brain development requires a tight orchestration between neural tube patterning and growth. How pattern formation and brain growth are coordinated is incompletely understood. Previously we showed that aristaless-related homeobox (ARX), a paired-like transcription factor, regulates cortical progenitor pool expansion by repressing an inhibitor of cell cycle progression. Here we show that ARX participates in establishing dorsoventral identity in the mouse forebrain. In Arx mutant mice, ventral genes, including Olig2, are ectopically expressed dorsally. Furthermore, Gli1 is upregulated, suggesting an ectopic activation of SHH signaling. We show that the ectopic Olig2 expression can be repressed by blocking SHH signaling, implicating a role for SHH signaling in Olig2 induction. We further demonstrate that the ectopic Olig2 accounts for the reduced Pax6 and Tbr2 expression, both dorsal specific genes essential for cortical progenitor cell proliferation. These data suggest a link between the control of dorsoventral identity of progenitor cells and the control of their proliferation. In summary, our data demonstrate that ARX functions in a gene regulatory network integrating normal forebrain patterning and growth, providing important insight into how mutations in ARX can disrupt multiple aspects of brain development and thus generate a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in human patients.",Arx Expression Suppresses Ventralization of the Developing Dorsal Forebrain.

"Background: The need for a more integrated, multidisciplinary approach to care for individuals with bleeding or clotting disorders has been highlighted in recent years. Evidence-based education adapted to nurses' needs is essential for a successful evolution. However, limited data currently exist on the clinical challenges nurses face in this specialty area. Objectives: Identify barriers and challenges faced by specialty nurses, and determine possible causes, to develop appropriate educational interventions. Methods: A mixed-methods study, combining qualitative (semi-structured interviews) and quantitative (online survey) data was conducted on the challenges experienced by hemostasis nurses in nine countries (Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US), and deployed in five languages (English, French, German, Mandarin, and Spanish). Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Quantitative data were analyzed using frequency tables, chi-squares and standard deviations. Results: Participants (n = 234) included nurses (n = 212; n = 22 qualitative; n = 190 quantitative); and patients receiving care for bleeding or clotting conditions or their caretakers (n = 22 qualitative phase only). Through triangulated data analysis, six challenging areas emerged: (a) Understanding of von Willebrand disease (VWD); (b) Anticoagulant safety profile in specific patients; (c) Understanding the treatment of patients with inhibitors; (d) Patient risk assessments; (e) Individualization of care and communication with patients; and (f) Accessing and implementing relevant professional education. Conclusions: This needs assessment provides a comprehensive illustration of the current challenges faced by nurses in the field of bleeding and clotting disorders, and indicates where gaps in skills, knowledge or confidence would benefit from nurse-specific educational programming.","Education needs of nurses in thrombosis and hemostasis: An international, mixed-methods study."

"BACKGROUND: Peppermint oil (PO) has intrinsic properties that may benefit patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. The study objective was to determine the effect of peppermint oil in the treatment of the IBS. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE (Ovid), and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PO for IBS. We appraised the eligible studies by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We performed random-effects meta-analysis on primary outcomes including global improvement in IBS symptoms and abdominal pain. A PRISMA-compliant study protocol is registered in PROSPERO Register [2016, CRD42016050917]. RESULTS: Twelve randomized trials with 835 patients were included. For global symptom improvement, the risk ratio (RR) from seven RCTs for the effect of PO (n = 253) versus placebo (n = 254) on global symptoms was 2.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.93, 2.97], I(2) = 0%, z = 7.93 (p < 0.00001). Regarding abdominal pain, the RR from six RCTs for the effect of PO (n = 278) versus placebo (n = 278) was 1.78 [95% CI: 1.43, 2.20], I(2) = 0%, z = 5.23 (p < 0.00001). Overall, there were no differences in the reported adverse effects: PO (32 events, 344 total, 9.3%) versus placebo (20 events, 327 total, 6.1%) for eight RCTs; RR 1.40 [95% CI: 0.87, 2.26] I(2) = 0%, z = 1.39 (p = 0.16). The number needed to treat with PO to prevent one patient from having persistent symptoms was three for global symptoms and four for abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: In the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date, PO was shown to be a safe and effective therapy for pain and global symptoms in adults with IBS.",The impact of peppermint oil on the irritable bowel syndrome: a meta-analysis of the pooled clinical data.
"Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII (MPS7, also called beta-glucuronidase deficiency or Sly syndrome; MIM 253220) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, caused by mutations in the GUSB gene. beta-glucuronidase (GUSB) is a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the stepwise degradation of glucuronic acid-containing glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Patients affected with MPS VII are not able to completely degrade glucuronic acid-containing GAGs, including chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate. The accumulation of these GAGs in lysosomes of various tissues leads to cellular and organ dysfunctions. Characteristic features of MPS VII include short stature, macrocephaly, hirsutism, coarse facies, hearing loss, cloudy cornea, short neck, valvular cardiac defects, hepatosplenomegaly, and dysostosis multiplex. Oral manifestations in patients affected with MPS VII have never been reported. Oral manifestations observed in three patients consist of wide root canal spaces, taurodontism, hyperplastic dental follicles, malposition of unerupted permanent molars, and failure of tooth eruption with malformed roots. The unusual skeletal features of the patients include maxillary hypoplasia, hypoplastic midface, long mandibular length, mandibular prognathism, hypoplastic and aplastic mandibular condyles, absence of the dens of the second cervical vertebra, and erosion of the cortex of the lower border of mandibles. Dogs affected with MPS VII had anterior and posterior open bite, maxillary hypoplasia, premolar crowding, and mandibular prognathism. Unlike patients with MPS VII, the dogs had unremarkable mandibular condyles. This is the first report of oral manifestations in patients affected with MPS VII.",Oral manifestations in patients and dogs with mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII.
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease with high prevalence among populations of northern European ancestry. Past studies have shown that exposure to ultraviolet radiation could explain the difference in MS prevalence across the globe. In this study, we investigate whether the difference in MS prevalence could be explained by European genetic risk factors. We characterized the ancestry of MS-associated alleles using RFMix, a conditional random field parameterized by random forests, to estimate their local ancestry in the largest assembled admixed population to date, with 3,692 African Americans, 4,915 Asian Americans, and 3,777 Hispanics. The majority of MS-associated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, including the prominent HLA-DRB1*15:01 risk allele, exhibited cosmopolitan ancestry. Ancestry-specific MS-associated HLA alleles were also identified. Analysis of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 risk allele in African Americans revealed that alleles on the European haplotype conferred three times the disease risk compared to those on the African haplotype. Furthermore, we found evidence that the European and African HLA-DRB1*15:01 alleles exhibit single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences in regions encoding the HLA-DRB1 antigen-binding heterodimer. Additional evidence for increased risk of MS conferred by the European haplotype were found for HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-A*03:01 in African Americans. Most of the 200 non-HLA MS SNPs previously established in European populations were not significantly associated with MS in admixed populations, nor were they ancestrally more European in cases compared to controls. Lastly, a genome-wide search of association between European ancestry and MS revealed a region of interest close to the ZNF596 gene on chromosome 8 in Hispanics; cases had a significantly higher proportion of European ancestry compared to controls. In conclusion, our study established that the genetic ancestry of MS-associated alleles is complex and implicated that difference in MS prevalence could be explained by the ancestry of MS-associated alleles.",Admixture mapping reveals evidence of differential multiple sclerosis risk by genetic ancestry.

"OBJECTIVE: To examine predictors of remission among patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) initiating a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. METHODS: Patients with PsA enrolled in the Corrona Registry between 2005 and 2013 were followed from initiation of a TNF inhibitor (TNFi; etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab, or golimumab) to the visit closest to 12 months. Additional inclusion criteria included 3 tender or 3 swollen joints. Outcomes of interest were Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) </= 2.8 (remission), low disease activity (LDA; CDAI </= 10), change in the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ) >/= 0.35 and achievement of mHAQ < 0.30. Predictors were measured on or before TNFi initiation. Covariates significant in univariable logistic regression models and </= 5% missing values were included in a multivariable model and removed individually until all remaining variables were significant (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Among 1832 TNFi initiations, 774 initiations (624 patients) met inclusion criteria. Median age at initiation was 52 years [interquartile range (IQR) 44-60], 56% were female, median PsA duration was 4 years (IQR 2-11), and median CDAI at baseline was 20 (IQR 14.5-28). Remission was achieved by 14% and LDA (or remission) by 37%. Achieving remission was positively associated with college education (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.11-3.19) but negatively associated with female sex (0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.97), obese body mass index (0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.81), hypertension (0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95), previous biologic use (0.41, 95% CI 0.26-0.65), and baseline pain (0.80 per 10 mm visual analog scale, 95% CI 0.73-0.87). Predictors for LDA, mHAQ < 0.30, and mHAQ change were similar. CONCLUSION: Few patients with PsA in a US-based registry achieved remission by CDAI criteria.

"Importance: Diversifying the health care workforce remains a critical goal for health care organizations focused on reducing disparities in care. However, it remains unknown what factors create inclusive health system environments and help organizations retain a diverse workforce. Objective: To understand from members of the health care workforce what factors contribute to inclusive work and learning environments and what can be done to improve inclusion within health care organizations. Design, Setting, and Participants: A qualitative narrative analysis of responses to a weekly email call for narratives within health care organizations sent June 1, 8, 15, and 22, 2016. The email contained an anonymous link to 2 open-ended stimulus questions asking for stories reflecting inclusion or lack thereof within participants' work environments as well as demographic questions. The study took place at 6 hospitals, including a free-standing children's hospital and a Veterans Affairs medical center, 4 health sciences schools (Medicine, Nursing, Dental, and Social Policy and Practice), and outpatient facilities within a university-based health care system in Pennsylvania. There were 315 completed narratives submitted from health care system executives (n = 3), staff (n = 113), academic faculty (n = 97), trainees or students (n = 99), and 3 who declined to specify their positions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Workplace experiences with inclusivity, implications of these experiences, and recommendations to improve inclusion within environments. Results: Of 315 narratives submitted from members of the health care system, in 188 (59.7%) the writer self-identified as female; in 10 (3.2%), as transgender/queer; in 38 (12.1%), as non-Hispanic black; in 152 (48.3%), as non-Christian; in 31 (9.8%), as having a language other than English as their primary language; and in 14 (4.4%), as having a disability. Analysis of the narratives revealed 6 broad factors that affected inclusion within health care organizations: (1) the presence of discrimination; (2) the silent witness; (3) the interplay of hierarchy, recognition, and civility; (4) the effectiveness of organizational leadership and mentors; (5) support for work-life balance; and (6) perceptions of exclusion from inclusion efforts. Challenges with inclusion had negative effects on job performance and well-being, with reports of stress, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness. Most respondents referenced a systemic culture that influenced their interpersonal dynamics and provided specific strategies to improve organizational culture that focused on leadership training and expanding collegial networks. Conclusions and Relevance: This narrative analysis provides a taxonomy of factors that health care organizations can use to assess inclusion within their learning and work environments as well as strategies to improve inclusion and retain a diverse health care workforce.",Perceptions of Factors Associated With Inclusive Work and Learning Environments in Health Care Organizations: A Qualitative Narrative Analysis.
"Importance: Neighborhood physical conditions have been associated with mental illness and may partially explain persistent socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of poor mental health. Objective: To evaluate whether interventions to green vacant urban land can improve self-reported mental health. Design, Setting, and Participants: This citywide cluster randomized trial examined 442 community-dwelling sampled adults living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, within 110 vacant lot clusters randomly assigned to 3 study groups. Participants were followed up for 18 months preintervention and postintervention. This trial was conducted from October 1, 2011, to November 30, 2014. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2015, to April 16, 2017. Interventions: The greening intervention involved removing trash, grading the land, planting new grass and a small number of trees, installing a low wooden perimeter fence, and performing regular monthly maintenance. The trash cleanup intervention involved removal of trash, limited grass mowing where possible, and regular monthly maintenance. The control group received no intervention. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported mental health measured by the Kessler-6 Psychological Distress Scale and the components of this scale. Results: A total of 110 clusters containing 541 vacant lots were enrolled in the trial and randomly allocated to the following 1 of 3 study groups: the greening intervention (37 clusters [33.6%]), the trash cleanup intervention (36 clusters [32.7%]), or no intervention (37 clusters [33.6%]). Of the 442 participants, the mean (SD) age was 44.6 (15.1) years, 264 (59.7%) were female, and 194 (43.9%) had a family income less than $25000. A total of 342 participants (77.4%) had follow-up data and were included in the analysis. Of these, 117 (34.2%) received the greening intervention, 107 (31.3%) the trash cleanup intervention, and 118 (34.5%) no intervention. Intention-to-treat analysis of the greening intervention compared with no intervention demonstrated a significant decrease in participants who were feeling depressed (-41.5%; 95% CI, -63.6% to -5.9%; P = .03) and worthless (-50.9%; 95% CI, -74.7% to -4.7%; P = .04), as well as a nonsignificant reduction in overall self-reported poor mental health (-62.8%; 95% CI, -86.2% to 0.4%; P = .051). For participants living in neighborhoods below the poverty line, the greening intervention demonstrated a significant decrease in feeling depressed (-68.7%; 95% CI, -86.5% to -27.5%; P = .007). Intention-to-treat analysis of those living near the trash cleanup intervention compared with no intervention showed no significant changes in self-reported poor mental health. Conclusions and Relevance: Among community-dwelling adults, self-reported feelings of depression and worthlessness were significantly decreased, and self-reported poor mental health was nonsignificantly reduced for those living near greened vacant land. The treatment of blighted physical environments, particularly in resource-limited urban settings, can be an important treatment for mental health problems alongside other patient-level treatments.

"Successful cognitive development between childhood and adulthood has important consequences for future mental and physical wellbeing, as well as occupational and financial success. Therefore, delineating the genetic influences underlying changes in cognitive abilities during this developmental period will provide important insights into the biological mechanisms that govern both typical and atypical maturation. Using data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), a large population-based sample of individuals aged 8 to 21 years old (n = 6634), we used an empirical relatedness matrix to establish the heritability of general and specific cognitive functions and determine if genetic factors influence cognitive maturation (i.e., Gene x Age interactions) between childhood and early adulthood. We found that neurocognitive measures across childhood and early adulthood were significantly heritable. Moreover, genetic variance on general cognitive ability, or g, increased significantly between childhood and early adulthood. Finally, we did not find evidence for decay in genetic correlation on neurocognition throughout childhood and adulthood, suggesting that the same genetic factors underlie cognition at different ages throughout this developmental period. Establishing significant Gene x Age interactions in neurocognitive functions across childhood and early adulthood is a necessary first step in identifying genes that influence cognitive development, rather than genes that influence cognition per se. Moreover, since aberrant cognitive development confers risk for several psychiatric disorders, further examination of these Gene x Age interactions may provide important insights into their etiology.",Genetic influence on cognitive development between childhood and adulthood.
"OBJECTIVE: To detect diffuse myocardial fibrosis in different severity levels of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (DD) in spontaneous type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rhesus monkeys. METHODS: Eighteen spontaneous T2DM and nine healthy monkeys were studied. Echocardiography was performed for diastolic function classification. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed to obtain extracellular volume fraction (ECV) maps and T1rho maps at two different spin-locking frequencies. ECV values, T1rho values, and myocardial fibrosis index (mFI) values which are based on the dispersion of T1rho, were calculated. Global peak diastolic longitudinal strain rates (GSrL) were also obtained. RESULTS: Echocardiography results showed mild DD in nine T2DM monkeys and moderate DD in the other nine. The global ECV values were significantly different among healthy animals as compared with animals with mild DD or moderate DD, and the ECV values of animals with moderate DD were significantly higher as compared with those of mild DD. The mFI values increased progressively from healthy animals to those with mild DD and then to those with moderate DD. Diastolic function indicators (e.g., early diastolic mitral annulus velocity, GSrL) correlated well with ECV and mFI. CONCLUSIONS: Monkeys with T2DM exhibit increased ECV, T1rho, and mFI values, which may be indicative of the expansion of extracellular volume and the deposition of excessive collagen. T1rho mapping may have the potential to be used for diffuse myocardial fibrosis assessment. KEY POINTS: * Monkeys with T2DM exhibit increased ECV, T1rho, and mFI values, which may be indicative of the expansion of extracellular volume and the deposition of excessive collagen. * The relationship between diastolic dysfunction and diffuse myocardial fibrosis may be demonstrated by imaging markers. * Non-contrast T1rho mapping may have the potential to be used for diffuse myocardial assessment.",MR extracellular volume mapping and non-contrast T1rho mapping allow early detection of myocardial fibrosis in diabetic monkeys.

"Objective evidence is limited for the value of transition programs for youth with chronic illness moving from pediatric to adult care; however, such programs intuitively ""make sense"". We describe the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of transition programs from around the world for adolescents with epilepsy. Consequences of poorly organized transition beyond suboptimal seizure control may include an increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), poor psychological and social outcome, and inadequate management of comorbidities. The content of transition programs for those with normal intelligence differs from those with intellectual disability, but both groups may benefit from an emphasis on sporting activities. Concerns that may interfere with optimal transition include lack of nursing or social work services, limited numbers of adult neurologists/epileptologists confident in the treatment of complex pediatric epilepsy problems, institutional financial support, and time constraints for pediatric and adult physicians who treat epilepsy and the provision of multidisciplinary care. Successful programs eventually need to rely on a several adult physicians, nurses, and other key healthcare providers and use novel approaches to complex care. More research is needed to document the value and effectiveness of transition programs for youth with epilepsy to persuade institutions and healthcare professionals to support these ventures.",How can transition to adult care be best orchestrated for adolescents with epilepsy?

"INTRODUCTION: Clinical outcomes data on BRAF-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated in routine practice is limited. To address this gap, we described treatment patterns and survival in a cohort of these patients evaluated/treated at 7 US academic cancer centers during 2009-2016. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review. Patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic NSCLC were selected. Current/previous participants in BRAF-related trials were excluded. Onset of metastatic NSCLC defined a patient's index date, which had to occur >/=6 months before the chart review date. Analyses were descriptive, including Kaplan-Meier analyses for overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The study included 72 patients. At index, median age (range) was 65 (44-90) years; 61.1% were female. Fifty-two patients received >/=1 line of systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy was the most common first-line (1 L) regimen (76.9% of 1 l recipients); no patient received 1 l targeted therapy (TT) with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor. In total, 20 patients received TT in any treatment line (2 l or later). At time of review, 38 patients were deceased. Median (95%CI) OS from index for all patients was 31.0 (14.5, 63.8) months. Median (95%CI) OS was 56.5 (13.4, 89.1) months from index for TT recipients and 27.2 (10.6, 64.6) months in patients not treated with TT. CONCLUSION: Survival time in BRAF V600-mutated metastatic NSCLC patients studied here was higher than expected based on indirect comparisons with historical NSCLC cohorts for whom no oncogenic driver (BRAF or otherwise) was present. TT recipients had a numerically longer OS from metastatic onset than patients receiving usual care, further highlighting the importance of TT in BRAF V600-mutant NSCLC.",Real-world treatment patterns and survival of patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
"There is an emerging belief that electrically elicited blink reflexes (BR) may distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) from other disorders characterized by memory dysfunction. To qualitatively and quantitatively distinguish the effects that electrical stimulation has over the blink reflex (eBR) recorded from patients with AD and healthy controls (HCs), we did a systematic review of the literature, and conducted a meta-analysis. Following our selected criteria, 94 AD patients and 97 HCs were identified from articles published in English between 1950 and 2017. Although the 3 responses (R1, R2 and R3) of the eBR were studied in a number of patients, only the R2 response was quantified in all studies. Thresholds and stimulation intensities parameters were found to be used in a miscellaneous form, and the majority of times, such parameters deviated from validated guidelines. The stimulation frequencies used to elicit the BR responses ranged between 0.14 and 0.2 Hz. These frequencies favored HCs compared with AD patients (odds ratio = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.30-1.85), I(2) = 0% [ P = .99]; Q = 271.89 [ df = 7, P < .000]). Egger's regression test suggested publication bias (intercept = 32.38; 95% CI = -8.98 to -3.2; P = .001). Our results unveiled key shortcomings in the data reported; such shortcomings need to be corrected in future AD research looking for obtaining more reliable and reproducible eBR studies; otherwise, interventions may be misleading.",The Three Nociceptive Responses of the Orbicularis Oculi Reflex in Alzheimer's Disease: State of the Evidence and Meta-analysis.
"Drugs used for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) include Abiraterone acetate (Zytiga((R))) and Enzalutamide (XTANDI((R))). However, these drugs provide clinical benefit in metastatic disease for only a brief period before drug resistance emerges. One mechanism of drug resistance involves the overexpression of type 5 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (aldo-keto reductase 1C3 or AKR1C3), a major enzyme responsible for the formation of intratumoral androgens that activate the androgen receptor (AR). 3-((4-Nitronaphthalen-1-yl)amino)benzoic acid 1 is a ""first-in-class"" AKR1C3 competitive inhibitor and AR antagonist. Compound 1 was compared in a battery of in vitro studies with structurally related N-naphthyl-aminobenzoates, and AKR1C3 targeted therapeutics e.g. GTx-560 and ASP9521, as well as with R-bicalutamide, enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate. Compound 1 was the only naphthyl derivative that was a selective AKR1C3 inhibitor and AR antagonist in direct competitive binding assays and in AR driven reporter gene assays. GTx-560 displayed weak activity as a direct AR antagonist but had high potency in the AR reporter gene assay consistent with its ability to inhibit the co-activator function of AKR1C3. By contrast ASP9521 did not act as either an AR antagonist or block AR reporter gene activity. Compound 1 was the only compound that showed comparable potency to inhibit AKR1C3 and act as a direct AR antagonist. Compound 1 blocked the formation of testosterone in LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells, and the expression of PSA driven by the AKR1C3 substrate (4-androstene-3,17-dione) and by an AR agonist, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone consistent with its bifunctional role. Compound 1 blocked the nuclear translocation of the AR at similar concentrations to enzalutamide and caused disappearance of the AR from cell lysates. R-biaclutamide and enzalutamide inhibited AKR1C3 at concentrations 200x greater than compound 1, suggesting that its bifunctionality can be explained by a shared pharmacophore that can be optimized.",A 3-(4-nitronaphthen-1-yl) amino-benzoate analog as a bifunctional AKR1C3 inhibitor and AR antagonist: Head to head comparison with other advanced AKR1C3 targeted therapeutics.
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a portable, rechargeable colposcope combined with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, as compared with HPV testing alone, for screening of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study among 488 women in Baoshan County, Yunnan. The women underwent HPV testing followed by Gynocular portable colposcopy with visual inspection with acetic acid. Obvious lesions were biopsied. If portable colposcopy testing was negative but HPV testing was positive, the women underwent follow-up testing with thin-prep cytology and traditional colposcopy. Cervical biopsies were performed for any abnormalities. Histopathology was followed up with diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: Among 488 women screened with portable colposcopy, 24 women underwent biopsy based on positive colposcopy screening. Of these 24 women, three were HPV positive and 21 were HPV negative. Five women had cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) I and one had advanced cervical cancer. Forty-six women tested positive for HPV. Three of these women had screened positive on preliminary colposcopy, with one positive for CIN III/squamous cell carcinoma and one woman with CIN I. Forty-three women underwent follow-up testing with thin-prep cytology. Two women had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and five had low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions and were biopsied; three women had CIN I, one had CIN II and one had CIN III. HPV testing and portable colposcopy was more sensitive but slightly less specific than portable colposcopy or HPV testing alone. CONCLUSION: While HPV testing has high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions and portable colposcopy has lower specificity, both methods of detection have low positive predictive value and high negative predictive value. In tandem, HPV testing and portable colposcopy had higher sensitivity for detection among women who underwent biopsies. In clinical practice, portable colposcopy was an effective, easy and affordable tool to transport to villages where cytology is not currently feasible.",Evaluation of portable colposcopy and human papillomavirus testing for screening of cervical cancer in rural China.
"OBJECTIVES: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common; however, no information is available on how pediatric gastroenterologists in the United States manage NAFLD. Therefore, study objectives were to understand how pediatric gastroenterologists in the US approach the management of NAFLD, and to identify barriers to care for children with NAFLD. METHODS: We performed structured one-on-one interviews to ascertain each individual pediatric gastroenterologist's approach to the management of NAFLD in children. Responses were recorded from open-ended questions regarding screening for comorbidities, recommendations regarding nutrition, physical activity, medications, and perceived barriers to care. RESULTS: Response rate was 72.0% (486/675). Mean number of patients examined per week was 3 (standard deviation [SD] 3.5). Dietary intervention was recommended by 98.4% of pediatric gastroenterologists. Notably, 18 different dietary recommendations were reported. A majority of physicians provided targets for exercise frequency (72.6%, mean 5.6 days/wk, SD 1.6) and duration (69.9%, mean 40.2 minutes/session, SD 16.4). Medications were prescribed by 50.6%. Almost one-half of physicians (47.5%) screened for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Providers who spent more than 25 minutes at the initial visit were more likely to screen for comorbidities (P = 0.003). Barriers to care were reported by 92.8% with 29.0% reporting >/=3 barriers. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of US pediatric gastroenterologists regularly encounter children with NAFLD. Varied recommendations regarding diet and exercise highlight the need for prospective clinical trials. NAFLD requires a multidimensional approach with adequate resources in the home, community, and clinical setting.",Clinical Practice Approach to Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease by Pediatric Gastroenterologists in the United States.

"The discovery of chromosomes, genes, and DNA in the early 20th century paved the way for the development of techniques to examine the role of these elements in disease pathogenesis. Since the start of the 21st century, genetic testing and particularly next-generation sequencing has allowed for a rapid rate of gene disease associations for a broad range of primary immunodeficiency patients. At the same time, biologic and small molecule-based therapies targeting specific molecular pathways have been developed and are being applied clinically and in research settings to treat genetically defined immunodeficiencies. In recent years, both the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology and the Clinical Immunology Society have recommended the use of genetic testing for diagnosis, therapy guidance, and genetic counseling in patients with clinical symptoms of primary immunodeficiency.",Now Is the Time to Use Molecular Gene Testing for the Diagnosis of Primary Immune Deficiencies.
"BACKGROUND: Despite the growing interest in screening for food insecurity in the clinical setting, little evidence exists regarding screening formats that maximize disclosure and caregiver comfort. METHODS: In this randomized trial, we asked English-speaking adult caregivers of pediatric patients in the emergency department at an urban, freestanding children's hospital to complete a validated, 2-question screen for food insecurity. Respondents were assigned via block randomization to complete the survey by either verbal interview or electronic tablet. Caregivers reported the perceived importance of the screening questions, comfort level with screening in the emergency department or in their child's primary care site, and their preferred screening modality. RESULTS: Of the 1818 participants, 20.6% screened positive for food insecurity. There was a significantly higher rate of reported food insecurity for those screened by tablet (23.6%) compared to those screened verbally (17.7%) (P=.002). Of those who had a preference of screening modality, 83.2% of all participants and 84.5% of patients reporting food insecurity preferred the tablet-based screen over verbal interview. Overall, more participants reported comfort completing the screen in the emergency department compared to their child's doctor's office; however, comfort in both of these setting was rated highly (86.1% vs 80.2%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Although both verbal interview and tablet-based screening modalities were effective in identifying food insecurity, tablet-based screening had a higher disclosure rate and was the participants' preferred screening method. There is a high level of comfort with screening regardless of clinical setting; it is possible that an added level of anonymity in the emergency department enhanced participants' comfort levels.",Food for Thought: A Randomized Trial of Food Insecurity Screening in the Emergency Department.
"The generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from embryonic endothelial precursors and pre-HSCs is precisely regulated by signaling pathways and transcription factors. Nevertheless, regulatory roles of non-coding RNAs remain unknown. Taking advantage of our ability to capture rare pre-HSCs and HSCs in vivo, we generated a single-cell landscape of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during HSC development. Combining bioinformatics and functional screening, we identified 6 lncRNAs influencing hematopoiesis in vitro. We further revealed that H19 lncRNA is pivotal for in vivo HSC emergence in aorta-gonads-mesonephros region. Early H19 lncRNA deficiency blocked endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, which was independent of the H19-derived miR, miR-675. Moreover, H19-deficient pre-HSCs displayed promoter hypermethylation and concomitant downregulation of several master hematopoietic transcription factors, including Runx1 and Spi1. H19 deficiency increased the activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, a regulator of DNA methylation, which partially contributed to the observed hematopoietic defect. Our findings provide a resource for further analysis of lncRNAs in embryonic HSC development.",Combined Single-Cell Profiling of lncRNAs and Functional Screening Reveals that H19 Is Pivotal for Embryonic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Development.
"Protein hydration is a critical aspect of protein stability, folding, and function and yet remains difficult to characterize experimentally. Solution NMR offers a route to a site-resolved view of the dynamics of protein-water interactions through the nuclear Overhauser effects between hydration water and the protein in the laboratory (NOE) and rotating (ROE) frames of reference. However, several artifacts and limitations including contaminating contributions from bulk water potentially plague this general approach and the corruption of measured NOEs and ROEs by hydrogen exchange-relayed magnetization. Fortunately, encapsulation of single protein molecules within the water core of a reverse micelle overcomes these limitations. The main advantages are the suppression hydrogen exchange and elimination of bulk water. Here we detail guidelines for the preparation solutions of encapsulated proteins that are suitable for characterization by NOE and ROE spectroscopy. Emphasis is placed on understanding the contribution of detected NOE intensity arising from magnetization relayed by hydrogen exchange. Various aspects of fitting obtained NOE, selectively decoupled NOE, and ROE time courses are illustrated.",Characterizing Protein Hydration Dynamics Using Solution NMR Spectroscopy.
"NMR-based studies of protein dynamics and molecular simulations have a synergistic relationship. Molecular simulations, in combination with interpretative theoretical models, leverage the dynamical information obtained from NMR. They provide the concrete physical schema underlying the quantities measured by NMR, and help extend the range of applications beyond the strictly dynamic properties. NMR data in turn provide concrete data to test and improve the potential functions used for simulation of dynamics of proteins. The concept of time correlation functions is central to the understanding of many dynamical processes. Their evaluation through atomistic simulations is discussed, with application to different dynamical quantities measured by NMR. While advances in computers have made such atomistic simulations almost routine, the companion use of simple interpretive models is stressed, to provide not just numbers but physical insight.",Companion Simulations and Modeling to NMR-Based Dynamical Studies of Proteins.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review research related to sex differences in eating disorders (EDs) in adolescents. Prior work has explored clinical differences; thus, we examine literature in areas identified as playing an etiological or maintenance role in EDs including: genetics, hormones, neurocognitive inefficiencies, and reward circuitry. RECENT FINDINGS: Sex steroids appear to a play role in the unmasking of genetic risk for development of EDs and puberty may be a heightened period of risk for females. While neurocognitive differences have been well studied in adults with ED, research with adolescents has been less conclusive. Recent work suggests that neural circuitry involved in reward and punishment may play role in development and maintenance of EDs in females. Males are underrepresented in these areas of research. Given known sex differences in healthy adolescents, it is likely there are sex differences in the putative biological etiology/maintenance of EDs. Males should be included in future research.",Sex Differences in Adolescent Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa: Beyond the Signs and Symptoms.
"BACKGROUND: Disruption of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and associated autophagy dysfunction contribute to neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of propofol on cell viability via its effects on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and the impact of autophagy, in a neuronal model of presenilin-mutated familial AD (FAD). METHODS: We treated PC12 cells, stably transfected with either mutated presenilin-1 (L286V) or wild type (WT) controls, with propofol at different doses and durations, in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, antagonists of inositol trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R, xestospongin C) and/or ryanodine receptors (RYR, dantrolene), or an inhibitor of autophagy flux (Bafilomycin). We determined cell viability, cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]c), vATPase protein expression, and lysosomal acidification. RESULTS: The propofol dose- and time-dependently decreased cell viability significantly more in L286V than WT cells, especially at the pharmacological dose (>50muM), and together with bafilomycin (40 nM). Clinically used concentrations of propofol (<20muM) tended to increase cell viability. Propofol significantly increased [Ca2+]c more in L286V than in WT cells, which was associated with decrease of vATPase expression and localization to the lysosome. Both toxicity and increased Ca2+ levels were ameliorated by inhibiting InsP3R/RYR. However, the combined inhibition of both receptors paradoxically increased [Ca2+]c, by inducing Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space, causing greater cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Impairment in autophagy function acts to deteriorate cell death induced by propofol in FAD neuronal cells. Cell death is ameliorated by either RYR or InsP3R antagonists on their own, but not when both are co-administered.",Alzheimer's Disease Presenilin-1 Mutation Sensitizes Neurons to Impaired Autophagy Flux and Propofol Neurotoxicity: Role of Calcium Dysregulation.
"OBJECTIVE: Although Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) has existed since the publication of DSM-5 in 2013, research on the descriptive psychopathology of treatment-seeking patients with formal ARFID diagnoses is sparse, and limited to tertiary eating disorder-focused treatment settings where most patients present with weight loss/malnutrition. In these settings, the selective/neophobic symptom presentation is rare compared to other primary eating restrictions. We aimed provide initial descriptive psychopathology of ARFID primary selective/neophobic symptom presentation in an outpatient setting, and to explore the prevalence of the core ARFID symptoms and clinical differences among patients meeting criteria based on weight/nutritional symptoms versus psychosocial impairment only. METHOD: We reviewed the charts of 22 consecutive outpatients diagnosed with ARFID caused by selective/neophobic eating, and describe symptoms, impairment, illness trajectory, and demographic features. Patients who met ARFID criteria because of weight loss/nutritional problems were compared to those who met for psychosocial impairment only on demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (81.8%) and school-aged (4-11 years). 81.8% had no weight/nutritional symptoms documented by a medical provider. All met criteria for significant psychosocial impairment. There were few differences between patients who did versus did not meet weight loss/nutritional criteria for ARFID; they differed only in age and in the presence of appetite disturbances consistent with another proposed presentation of ARFID. DISCUSSION: These results provide novel data on the clinical characteristics of individuals who present with a primary presentation of selective/neophobic ARFID, including support for psychosocial impairment as sufficient for fulfilling ARFID criterion A.",Characteristics of outpatients diagnosed with the selective/neophobic presentation of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.
"BACKGROUND: The presence of a hernia sac in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) has been reported to be associated with higher lung volumes and better postnatal outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To compare prenatal imaging (ultrasound and MRI) prognostic measurements and postnatal outcomes of CDH with and without hernia sac. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed database searches from January 2008 to March 2017 for surgically proven cases of CDH with and without hernia sac. All children had a detailed ultrasound (US) examination and most had an MRI examination. We reviewed the medical records of children enrolled in our Pulmonary Hypoplasia Program. RESULTS: Of 200 cases of unilateral CDH, 46 (23%) had hernia sacs. Cases of CDH with hernia sac had a higher mean lung-to-head ratio (LHR; 1.61 vs. 1.17; P<0.01), a higher mean observed/expected LHR (0.49 vs. 0.37; P<0.01), and on MRI a higher mean observed/expected total lung volume (0.53 vs. 0.41; P<0.01). Based on a smooth interface between lung and herniated contents, hernia sac or eventration was prospectively questioned by US and MRI in 45.7% and 38.6% of cases, respectively. Postnatally, hernia sac is associated with shorter median periods of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (45.0 days vs. 61.5 days, P=0.03); mechanical ventilation (15.5 days vs. 23.5 days, P=0.04); extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (251 h vs. 434 h, P=0.04); decreased rates of patch repair (39.0% vs. 69.2%, P<0.01); and pulmonary hypertension (56.1% vs. 75.4%, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Hernia sac is associated with statistically higher prenatal prognostic measurements and improved postnatal outcomes. Recognition of a sharp interface between lung and herniated contents may allow for improved prenatal diagnosis; however, delivery and management should still occur at experienced quaternary neonatal centers.",Congenital diaphragmatic hernia sacs: prenatal imaging and associated postnatal outcomes.
"CENP-A is the histone H3 variant necessary to specify the location of all eukaryotic centromeres via its CENP-A targeting domain and either one of its terminal regions. In humans, several post-translational modifications occur on CENP-A, but their role in centromere function remains controversial. One of these modifications of CENP-A, phosphorylation on serine 7, has been proposed to control centromere assembly and function. Here, using gene targeting at both endogenous CENP-A alleles and gene replacement in human cells, we demonstrate that a CENP-A variant that cannot be phosphorylated at serine 7 maintains correct CENP-C recruitment, faithful chromosome segregation and long-term cell viability. Thus, we conclude that phosphorylation of CENP-A on serine 7 is dispensable to maintain correct centromere dynamics and function.",Phosphorylation of CENP-A on serine 7 does not control centromere function.
"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neuro- and cardio-degenerative disorder characterized by ataxia, sensory loss, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In most cases, the disorder is caused by GAA repeat expansions in the first introns of both alleles of the FXN gene, resulting in decreased expression of the encoded protein, frataxin. Frataxin localizes to the mitochondrial matrix and is required for iron-sulfur-cluster biosynthesis. Decreased expression of frataxin is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial iron accumulation, and increased oxidative stress. Ferropotosis is a recently identified pathway of regulated, iron-dependent cell death, which is biochemically distinct from apoptosis. We evaluated whether there is evidence for ferroptotic pathway activation in cellular models of FRDA. We found that primary patient-derived fibroblasts, murine fibroblasts with FRDA-associated mutations, and murine fibroblasts in which a repeat expansion had been introduced (knockin/knockout) were more sensitive than normal control cells to erastin, a known ferroptosis inducer. We also found that the ferroptosis inhibitors ethyl 3-(benzylamino)-4-(cyclohexylamino)benzoate (SRS11-92) and ethyl 3-amino-4-(cyclohexylamino)benzoate, used at 500 nM, were efficacious in protecting human and mouse cellular models of FRDA treated with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) and an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis [L-buthionine (S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO)], whereas caspase-3 inhibitors failed to show significant biologic activity. Cells treated with FAC and BSO consistently showed decreased glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity and increased lipid peroxidation, both hallmarks of ferroptosis. Finally, the ferroptosis inhibitor SRS11-92 decreased the cell death associated with frataxin knockdown in healthy human fibroblasts. Taken together, these data suggest that ferroptosis inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in FRDA.",Ferroptosis as a Novel Therapeutic Target for Friedreich's Ataxia.

"It is the position of the Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior that environmental sustainability should be inherent in dietary guidance, whether working with individuals or groups about their dietary choices or in setting national dietary guidance. Improving the nutritional health of a population is a long-term goal that requires ensuring the long-term sustainability of the food system. Current environmental trends, including those related to climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, water shortages, and water pollution, threaten long-term food security and are caused in part by current diets and agricultural practices. Addressing these problems while producing more food for a growing population will require changes to current food systems. Dietary choices have a significant role in contributing to environmental impacts, which could be lessened by consuming fewer overconsumed animal products and more plant-based foods while reducing excess energy intake and the amount of food wasted. Discussion of sustainability within governmental dietary guidance is common in many countries, is consistent with previous US guidelines, and is within the scope of authorizing legislation. Dietary choices are a personal matter, but many American consumers are motivated by a concern for the environment and would welcome sound advice from credentialed nutrition professionals. More opportunities are needed for developing such interdisciplinary knowledge among nutritionists.",Position of the Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior: The Importance of Including Environmental Sustainability in Dietary Guidance.
"Although e-cigarettes in the United States are required to carry one nicotine addiction warning, little is known about the impact of other potential e-cigarette warning themes, nor about pairing warnings with messages that communicate e-cigarettes' reduced-harm potential relative to cigarettes. We randomly assigned 876 young adults (ages 18(-)29) to view e-cigarette ads in a 3 x 2 plus control online experiment that varied by warning theme (i.e., nicotine addiction; nicotine's impact on adolescent brain development; presence of harmful chemicals) and warning type-i.e., the presence (""relative harm warning"") or absence (""standard warning"") of a relative harm (RH) statement in the warning label (""e-cigarettes may cause harm to health but are less harmful than cigarettes""). Warning believability, informativeness, understandability and support were high across conditions and there were no significant differences by warning theme on e-cigarette harm perceptions or use intentions nor on nicotine (mis)perceptions. Perceived warning effectiveness for discouraging youth initiation was higher for the ""brain"" and ""chemicals"" warnings compared to the addiction warning. Warnings with the included RH statement were perceived as less believable and credible and were less frequently correctly recalled.

"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Intrauterine device (IUD) utilization in the United States is low among adolescent and young adult women. Longer procedure duration has been proposed as one potential barrier to IUD insertion in this population. We hypothesized that procedure duration would be longer in adolescents compared to young adult women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of a lidocaine versus sham paracervical nerve block for pain control during levonorgestrel 13.5 mg IUD insertion. Adolescent and young adult women ages 14 to 22 years were recruited from three outpatient academic sites in Philadelphia, PA. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain scores were recorded at seven steps during the procedure from speculum insertion through removal. Time stamps associated with each step were used to calculate the overall procedure duration. Cumulative IUD insertion procedure duration was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Ninety-five women enrolled. Nineteen (20%) were ages 14 to 17 and 76 (80%) were ages 18 to 22 years. The median procedure duration (seconds + IQR) was longer for adolescents than young adults (555 + 428 seconds versus 383 + 196 seconds, p = 0.008). After adjusting for study site, the difference in expected median procedure duration between age groups was not significant (p=0.3832). CONCLUSION: The duration of IUD insertion procedures in adolescent and young adult women is not clinically or statistically significant. Providers should not withhold IUDs from appropriate adolescent and young adult women based on age alone.

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of obstetric delivery volume, high-risk condition volume, and their combined effect on maternal outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined more than 10 million deliveries in three states from 1995 to 2009 using linked birth-hospital discharge records. Surgical high-risk patients had one of three prenatally identifiable conditions; the high-risk medical cohort had 1 or more of 14 complicating diagnoses. Hospitals were divided into quartiles of total obstetric delivery volume and tertiles of high-risk patient volume. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of severe maternal morbidity identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, codes. Data were controlled for nonindependence using clustering by hospital and results were adjusted for patient and hospital level factors. RESULTS: We identified 142,194 high-risk surgical deliveries and 1,322,276 high-risk medical deliveries for evaluation. Among surgical high-risk patients, higher hospital total obstetric delivery volume was associated with 22% decreased risk for maternal morbidity (4th quartile adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.78; 95% CI 0.64-0.94); likewise for medical high-risk patients, higher total delivery volume was associated with a 28% decreased risk (4th quartile AOR 0.72; 95% CI 0.59-0.86). Conversely, as the volume of medical high-risk patients at hospitals increased, the AOR for severe morbidity increased (AOR=1.27, 95% CI 1.10-1.48). There was a significant interaction effect of both types of volume on maternal complications for both surgical (likelihood ratio [LR] chi=18.2, P=.006) and medical high-risk patients (LR chi=99.4, P<.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with high-risk medical and surgical conditions had decreasing adverse maternal outcomes as total obstetric delivery volume increased. There were increased odds of adverse maternal outcomes in centers with high volumes of high-risk patients. These two types of volume had significant combined effect on maternal risk. Both types of volume should be considered in assessing hospital obstetric performance.",Effects of Delivery Volume and High-Risk Condition Volume on Maternal Morbidity Among High-Risk Obstetric Patients.

"Aggressive behaviours of solid tumours are highly influenced by the tumour microenvironment. Multiple signalling pathways can affect the normal function of stromal fibroblasts in tumours, but how these events are coordinated to generate tumour-promoting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is not well understood. Here we show that stromal expression of Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) is associated with aggressive breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers. We demonstrate that DKK3 is a HSF1 effector that modulates the pro-tumorigenic behaviour of CAFs in vitro and in vivo. DKK3 orchestrates a concomitant activation of beta-catenin and YAP/TAZ. Whereas beta-catenin is dispensable for CAF-mediated ECM remodelling, cancer cell growth and invasion, DKK3-driven YAP/TAZ activation is required to induce tumour-promoting phenotypes. Mechanistically, DKK3 in CAFs acts via canonical Wnt signalling by interfering with the negative regulator Kremen and increasing cell-surface levels of LRP6. This work reveals an unpredicted link between HSF1, Wnt signalling and YAP/TAZ relevant for the generation of tumour-promoting CAFs.",Dickkopf-3 links HSF1 and YAP/TAZ signalling to control aggressive behaviours in cancer-associated fibroblasts.
"Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive genetic red cell disorder with worldwide distribution. Growing evidence suggests a possible involvement of complement activation in the severity of sickle cell clinical complication. Here, we found activation of the alternative complement pathway with microvascular deposition of C5b-9 on skin biopsies from sickle cell disease patients. This was also supported by sickle red cell membrane the deposition of C3b on sickle red cell membranes, which is locally promoted by the exposure of phosphatidylserine. In addition, we showed for the first time a peculiar ""stop-and-go"" motion of SCD RBCs on TNF-alpha activated vascular endothelial surfaces. Using the C3b/iC3b binding plasma protein Factor-H as an inhibitor of C3b cell-cell interactions, we found that Factor-H and Factor-H 19-20 domains prevent the adhesion of sickle red cells to the endothelium, normalizing speed transition times of red cells on inflammatory activated endothelium. We have firstly documented that FH acts by preventing the adhesion of sickle red cells to P-selectin and/or the receptor Mac-1 receptor (CD11b/CD18), supporting the activation of the alternative pathway of complement as an additional mechanism in the pathogenesis of acute sickle cell related vaso-occlusive crisis.

"PURPOSE: To investigate national utilization trends of minimally-invasive partial nephrectomy (PN) and minimally-invasive radical nephrectomy (RN), and to identify disparities in the usage of these techniques across different sociodemographic subgroups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Cancer Database to identify patients undergoing partial or RN for cT1N0M0 renal cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2015. Main outcomes of interest were the utilizations of minimally-invasive (robotic and laparoscopic) PN and RN. RESULTS: A total of 46,346 and 37,712 subjects who underwent PN and RN, respectively, were analyzed. During the study interval, increased utilization of robotic surgery paralleled the decreased utilization of open surgery. Robotic PN increased from 35.2% to 63.7% and robotic RN increased from 10.3% to 26.3%. The utilization of laparoscopic surgery was decreasing for PN but stable for RN through the study period. In the PN cohort, multivariable logistic regression showed non-Hispanic black (odds ratio [OR]=0.90 [95% CI, 0.84-0.96]) and Hispanic (OR=0.91 [0.84-0.99]) subjects were associated with less utilization of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) (vs. non-Hispanic white). Younger (18-64 years) Medicare (OR=0.83 [0.77-0.90]), Medicaid (OR=0.80 [0.74-0.87]), and uninsured (OR=0.55 [0.49-0.62]) were also associated with less utilization of MIS (vs. private insurance). Compared with low socioeconomic status (SES), upper middle (OR=1.14 [1.07-1.21]) and high (OR=1.24 [1.16-1.33]) SES were associated with higher utilization of MIS. Similar demographic, insurance, and SES-related disparities were identified in the RN cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of MIS for localized renal cancer has increased significantly and was mainly attributed to increased usage of robotic surgery. Racial/ethnic, insurance, and SES related disparities in MIS utilization were identified. Our findings demonstrate a targetable subgroup of patients who do not have the same access to advances in surgical technology.","National trends and disparities of minimally invasive surgery for localized renal cancer, 2010 to 2015."

"BACKGROUND: What and how infants are fed are considered important determinants for the risk factor of early rapid gain weight. OBJECTIVES: We conducted secondary analyses on data from a randomized clinical trial, wherein infants randomized to feed cow milk formula had double the incidence of early rapid weight gain than those fed extensively hydrolyzed protein formula, to determine whether maternal feeding styles had independent effects or interactive effects with infant formula type on early rapid weight gain. METHODS: Anthropometry and feeding patterning (number of daily formula feeds) were measured monthly, and maternal feeding styles were measured at 0.5, 3.5, and 4.5 months. Longitudinal models were fitted using generalized estimating equations and separate logistic models conducted. RESULTS: The treatment groups did not differ in formula feeding patterning or in maternal feeding styles, which were stable across the first 4.5 months. Feeding styles had no significant effects on early rapid weight gain and did not interact with formula group. However, type of infant formula had a direct and independent impact on early rapid weight gain (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The type of infant formula had a differential impact on early rapid weight gain independent of maternal feeding style, highlighting the self-regulatory capabilities of infants.",Early rapid weight gain among formula-fed infants: Impact of formula type and maternal feeding styles.
"Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) is an effective therapy for mycosis fungoides (MF), the skin-limited variant of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). In low-burden patients, PUVA reduced or eradicated malignant T cells and induced clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells associated with malignant T cell depletion. High-burden patients appeared to clinically improve but large numbers of malignant T cells persisted in skin. Clinical improvement was linked to turnover of benign T cell clones but not to malignant T cell reduction. Benign T cells were associated with the Th2-recruiting chemokine CCL18 before therapy and with the Th1-recruiting chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 after therapy, suggesting a switch from Th2 to Th1. Inflammation was correlated with OX40L and CD40L gene expression; immunostaining localized these receptors to CCL18-expressing c-Kit+ dendritic cells that clustered together with CD40+OX40+ benign and CD40+CD40L+ malignant T cells, creating a proinflammatory synapse in skin. Our data suggest that visible inflammation in CTCL results from the recruitment and activation of benign T cells by c-Kit+OX40L+CD40L+ dendritic cells and that this activation may provide tumorigenic signals. Targeting c-Kit, OX40, and CD40 signaling may be novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of MF.",Benign T cells drive clinical skin inflammation in cutaneous T cell lymphoma.
"Arterial stiffening is a consequence of aging and a cholesterol-independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Arterial stiffening and CVD show a sex bias, with men more susceptible than premenopausal women. How arterial stiffness and sex interact at a molecular level to confer risk of CVD is not well understood. Here, we used the sexual dimorphism in LDLR-null mice to show that the protective effect of female sex on atherosclerosis is linked to reduced aortic stiffness and reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12) by lesional macrophages. Deletion of MMP12 in LDLR-null mice attenuated the male sex bias for both arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis, and these effects occurred despite high serum cholesterol. Mechanistically, we found that oxidized LDL stimulates secretion of MMP12 in human as well as mouse macrophages. Estrogen antagonizes this effect by downregulating MMP12 expression. Our data support cholesterol-independent causal relationships between estrogen, oxidized LDL-induced secretion of macrophage MMP12, and arterial stiffness that protect against atherosclerosis in females and emphasize that reduced MMP12 functionality can confer atheroprotection to males.",Cardiovascular protection in females linked to estrogen-dependent inhibition of arterial stiffening and macrophage MMP12.

"BACKGROUND: Endogenous contrast T1rho cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can detect scar or infiltrative fibrosis in patients with ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Existing 2D T1rho techniques have limited spatial coverage or require multiple breath-holds. The purpose of this project was to develop an accelerated, free-breathing 3D T1rho mapping sequence with whole left ventricle coverage using a multicoil, compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction technique for rapid reconstruction of undersampled k-space data. METHODS: We developed a cardiac- and respiratory-gated, free-breathing 3D T1rho sequence and acquired data using a variable-density k-space sampling pattern (A = 3). The effect of the transient magnetization trajectory, incomplete recovery of magnetization between T1rho-preparations (heart rate dependence), and k-space sampling pattern on T1rho relaxation time error and edge blurring was analyzed using Bloch simulations for normal and chronically infarcted myocardium. Sequence accuracy and repeatability was evaluated using MnCl2 phantoms with different T1rho relaxation times and compared to 2D measurements. We further assessed accuracy and repeatability in healthy subjects and compared these results to 2D breath-held measurements. RESULTS: The error in T1rho due to incomplete recovery of magnetization between T1rho-preparations was T1rhohealthy = 6.1% and T1rhoinfarct = 10.8% at 60 bpm and T1rhohealthy = 13.2% and T1rhoinfarct = 19.6% at 90 bpm. At a heart rate of 60 bpm, error from the combined effects of readout-dependent magnetization transients, k-space undersampling and reordering was T1rhohealthy = 12.6% and T1rhoinfarct = 5.8%. CS reconstructions had improved edge sharpness (blur metric = 0.15) compared to inverse Fourier transform reconstructions (blur metric = 0.48). There was strong agreement between the mean T1rho estimated from the 2D and accelerated 3D data (R(2) = 0.99; P < 0.05) acquired on the MnCl2 phantoms. The mean R1rho estimated from the accelerated 3D sequence was highly correlated with MnCl2 concentration (R(2) = 0.99; P < 0.05). 3D T1rho acquisitions were successful in all human subjects. There was no significant bias between undersampled 3D T1rho and breath-held 2D T1rho (mean bias = 0.87) and the measurements had good repeatability (COV2D = 6.4% and COV3D = 7.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an accelerated, free-breathing 3D T1rho mapping of the left ventricle. This technique may improve non-contrast myocardial tissue characterization in patients with heart disease in a scan time appropriate for patients.",Accelerated free-breathing 3D T1rho cardiovascular magnetic resonance using multicoil compressed sensing.
"Objective- This study aims to determine whether and how the enriched metabolites of endothelial extracellular vesicles (eEVs) are critical for cigarette smoke-induced direct injury of endothelial cells and the development of pulmonary hypertension, rarely explored in contrast to long-investigated mechanisms secondary to chronic hypoxemia. Approach and Results- Metabonomic screen of eEVs from cigarette-smoking human subjects reveals prominent elevation of spermine-a polyamine metabolite with potent agonist activity for the extracellular CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor). CaSR inhibition with the negative allosteric modulator Calhex231 or CaSR knockdown attenuates cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats without emphysematous changes in lungs or chronic hypoxemia. Cigarette smoke exposure increases the generation of spermine-positive eEVs and their spermine content. Immunocytochemical staining and immunogold electron microscopy recognize the spermine enrichment not only within the cytosol but also on the outer surface of eEV membrane. The repression of spermine synthesis, the inhibitory analog of spermine, N(1)-dansyl-spermine, Calhex231, or CaSR knockdown profoundly suppresses eEV exposure-mobilized cytosolic calcium signaling, pulmonary artery constriction, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Confocal imaging of immunohistochemical staining demonstrates the migration of spermine-positive eEVs from endothelium into smooth muscle cells in pulmonary arteries of cigarette smoke-exposed rats. The repression of spermine synthesis or CaSR knockout results in attenuated development of pulmonary hypertension induced by an intravascular administration of eEVs. Conclusions- Cigarette smoke enhances eEV generation with spermine enrichment at their outer surface and cytosol, which activates CaSR and subsequently causes smooth muscle cell constriction and proliferation, therefore, directly leading to the development of pulmonary hypertension.",Spermine on Endothelial Extracellular Vesicles Mediates Smoking-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension Partially Through Calcium-Sensing Receptor.
"OBJECTIVE: Excess physician work hours contribute to burnout and medical errors. Self-report of work hours is burdensome and often inaccurate. We aimed to validate a method that automatically determines provider shift duration based on electronic health record (EHR) timestamps across multiple inpatient settings within a single institution. METHODS: We developed an algorithm to calculate shift start and end times for inpatient providers based on EHR timestamps. We validated the algorithm based on overlap between calculated shifts and scheduled shifts. We then demonstrated a use case by calculating shifts for pediatric residents on inpatient rotations from July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016, comparing hours worked and number of shifts by rotation and role. RESULTS: We collected 6.3 x 10(7) EHR timestamps for 144 residents on 771 inpatient rotations, yielding 14,678 EHR-calculated shifts. Validation on a subset of shifts demonstrated 100% shift match and 87.9 +/- 0.3% overlap (mean +/- standard error [SE]) with scheduled shifts. Senior residents functioning as front-line clinicians worked more hours per 4-week block (mean +/- SE: 273.5 +/- 1.7) than senior residents in supervisory roles (253 +/- 2.3) and junior residents (241 +/- 2.5). Junior residents worked more shifts per block (21 +/- 0.1) than senior residents (18 +/- 0.1). CONCLUSION: Automatic calculation of inpatient provider work hours is feasible using EHR timestamps. An algorithm to assess provider work hours demonstrated criterion validity via comparison with scheduled shifts. Differences between junior and senior residents in calculated mean hours worked and number of shifts per 4-week block were also consistent with differences in scheduled shifts and duty-hour restrictions.",Automatic Detection of Front-Line Clinician Hospital Shifts: A Novel Use of Electronic Health Record Timestamp Data.
"BACKGROUND: Sickle cell trait (SCT) is common among African Americans and has been historically considered to be benign. Recently, SCT has been associated with an increased risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease in the general population. Our understanding of SCT has been extrapolated largely from data of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Notably, in SCD, the outcomes differ by sex. The effect of SCT on cardiovascular risk in the African American CKD population is unknown, and the interaction between SCT and sex on cardiovascular risk has not been investigated. METHODS: We performed a 2-center retrospective cohort study of all African American patients with SCT using international classification of disease diagnosis codes and CKD (using the 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria) with at least 1 year of follow-up between January 2005 and December 2017. A reference group of -African American CKD patients without SCT was used as a comparator during the same period. SCT patients and the reference patients were matched at baseline for age, sex, comorbidities, and proteinuria. Primary outcomes were incident coronary artery disease (CAD), incident stroke, and all-cause mortality. Analysis of effect modification between sex and SCT on primary outcomes was performed. RESULTS: We identified 621 African American CKD patients, 217 SCT patients, and 404 reference patients. The mean age was 56 +/- 13 years and 66% were female. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 69 +/- 30 mL/min. The mean follow-up time was 8 +/- 4 years. There were no significant differences in the primary outcomes comparing SCT patients to matched controls. The interaction term between SCT and sex, however, was significant in the CAD model (p < 0.01). Stratification by sex showed no increased risk in females but a significantly increased risk for CAD in male SCT patients (hazard ratio [HR] 2.14; 95% CI 1.18-3.86), which persisted after multivariable analysis (HR 2.13; 95% CI 1.17-3.86). CONCLUSION: SCT is associated with an increased risk for CAD in African American males with CKD. The excess risk in males with SCT appears to follow the same pattern as risk in males with SCD. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.",Cardiovascular Outcomes in African Americans with Sickle Cell Trait and Chronic Kidney Disease.
"Conditioning regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are harmful to reproductive function, but national utilization of fertility preservation (FP) before HCT has not been studied. The primary aim of this descriptive retrospective analysis is to understand FP utilization in the HCT population of patients between ages 18 and 40 years, whereas the secondary aim is to describe temporal trends in FP before HCT. Key dates, procedures codes, and diagnosis codes were extracted from administrative and health services commercial claims data, which were obtained from FAIR Health's national claims database, to construct 29 patient-specific clinical journey timelines detailing the time from diagnosis to FP and to HCT. Patient characteristics studied include sex, age, HCT type (autologous and allogeneic), and census region. Key findings from primary and secondary analyses were that 7% of the HCT cohort had claims for FP services, FP utilization before HCT decreased with increasing age, there were 102 days (median) between FP and HCT procedure date, and 7 of 29 patients who received FP services had a nonmalignant primary indication for HCT. More research is needed to understand the barriers to FP before HCT so that targeted tools can be used to increase utilization and improve quality of life for HCT survivors.",Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Utilization of Fertility Preservation Services.

"BACKGROUND: The Rwanda Human Resources for Health Program (HRH Program) is a 7-year (2012-2019) health professional training initiative led by the Government of Rwanda with the goals of training a large, diverse, and competent health workforce and strengthening the capacity of academic institutions in Rwanda. METHODS: The data for this organizational case study was collected through official reports from the Rwanda Ministry of Health (MoH) and 22 participating US academic institutions, databases from the MoH and the College of Medicine and Health Sciences (CMHS) in Rwanda, and surveys completed by the co-authors. RESULTS: In the first 5 years of the HRH Program, a consortium of US academic institutions has deployed an average of 99 visiting faculty per year to support 22 training programs, which are on track to graduate almost 4600 students by 2019. The HRH Program has also built capacity within the CMHS by promoting the recruitment of Rwandan faculty and the establishment of additional partnerships and collaborations with the US academic institutions. CONCLUSION: The milestones achieved by the HRH Program have been substantial although some challenges persist. These challenges include adequately supporting the visiting faculty; pairing them with Rwandan faculty (twinning); ensuring strong communication and coordination among stakeholders; addressing mismatches in priorities between donors and implementers; the execution of a sustainability strategy; and the decision by one of the donors not to renew funding beyond March 2017. Over the next 2 academic years, it is critical for the sustainability of the 22 training programs supported by the HRH Program that the health-related Schools at the CMHS significantly scale up recruitment of new Rwandan faculty. The HRH Program can serve as a model for other training initiatives implemented in countries affected by a severe shortage of health professionals.",Health Professional Training and Capacity Strengthening Through International Academic Partnerships: The First Five Years of the Human Resources for Health Program in Rwanda.
"OBJECTIVE: Several studies assessed maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with the risk of childhood high blood pressure, and the results were inconsistent. We investigated the association between maternal GDM and hypertension risk in offspring during early childhood. METHODS: We performed a large study in 1,156 mother-child pairs (578 GDM and 578 non-GDM matched by their offspring's age and sex). Maternal GDM was diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria. Childhood height, weight, and blood pressure were measured using standardized methods. Age-, sex-, and height-specific blood pressure Z score, childhood hypertension, and high blood pressure were evaluated according to the reference range of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents. RESULTS: After adjustment for maternal and children's characteristics, children born to mothers with GDM during pregnancy had higher mean values of systolic blood pressure Z score (0.09 vs. -0.17), and higher prevalence of hypertension (6.4% vs. 3.5%) and high blood pressure (15.6% vs. 9.3%) in comparison with their counterparts born to mothers without GDM during pregnancy (all P values <0.05). Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios among children of mothers with GDM compared with children of mothers without GDM were 2.32 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.16-4.62) for hypertension and 1.89 (95% CI 1.24-2.86) for high blood pressure, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal GDM was associated with an increased risk of hypertension in the offspring. Controlling maternal GDM may be important for preventing childhood hypertension in the affected offspring.",Maternal Gestational Diabetes Is Associated With Offspring's Hypertension.
"As point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) becomes standard practice in pediatric emergency medicine (PEM), it is important to have benchmarks in place for credentialing PEM faculty in POCUS. Faculty must be systematically trained and assessed for competency in order to be credentialed in POCUS and granted privileges by an individual institution. Recommendations on credentialing PEM faculty are needed to ensure appropriate, consistent, and responsible use of this diagnostic and procedural tool. It is our intention that these guidelines will serve as a framework for credentialing faculty in PEM POCUS.",Credentialing Pediatric Emergency Medicine Faculty in Point-of-Care Ultrasound: Expert Guidelines.
"Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging has been widely applied to identify cerebral blood flow (CBF) abnormalities in a number of brain disorders. To evaluate its significance in detecting methamphetamine (MA) dependence, this study used a multivariate pattern classification algorithm, ie, a support vector machine (SVM), to construct classifiers for discriminating MA-dependent subjects from normal controls. Forty-five MA-dependent subjects, 45 normal controls, and 36 heroin-dependent subjects were enrolled. Classifiers trained with ASL-CBF data from the left or right cerebrum showed significant hemispheric asymmetry in their cross-validated prediction performance (P < 0.001 for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, kappa, and area under the curve [AUC] of the receiver operating characteristics [ROC] curve). A classifier trained with ASL-CBF data from all cerebral regions (bilateral hemispheres and corpus callosum) was able to differentiate MA-dependent subjects from normal controls with a cross-validated prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, kappa, and AUC of 89%, 94%, 84%, 0.78, and 0.95, respectively. The discrimination map extracted from this classifier covered multiple brain circuits that either constitute a network related to drug abuse and addiction or could be impaired in MA-dependence. The cerebral regions contribute most to classification include occipital lobe, insular cortex, postcentral gyrus, corpus callosum, and inferior frontal cortex. This classifier was also specific to MA-dependence rather than substance use disorders in general (ie, 55.56% accuracy for heroin dependence). These results support the future utilization of ASL with an SVM-based classifier for the diagnosis of MA-dependence and could help improve the understanding of MA-related neuropathology.",Support vector machine-based multivariate pattern classification of methamphetamine dependence using arterial spin labeling.
"BACKGROUND: Osteomyelitis is a challenging diagnosis for clinicians, particularly in very young children. At our institution, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol in suspected osteomyelitis for children 5 years of age or younger includes a large field of imaging regardless of the clinical site of concern. OBJECTIVE: To determine if extended field of view (FOV) MRI contributes important information in young children with suspected osteomyelitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed including children 5 years of age or younger with suspected osteomyelitis from January 2011 to September 2015. All children underwent coronal fluid-sensitive MRI from neck to feet. Focused imaging was performed as necessary on abnormal sites depicted on survey imaging. Two radiologists reviewed the imaging findings, which were compared to the clinical outcome. RESULTS: We studied 51 children with a mean age of 2.2 years (range: 21 days-5.5 years); 53% were boys. Osteomyelitis was depicted by MRI in 20 subjects (39.2%). Survey coronal fluid-sensitive imaging was accomplished by adding a single fluid-sensitive series in 1 child, 2 series in 31 children, 3 series in 16 children and 4 series in 3 children. Survey imaging added a median total time of 6:51 min to the examination (range: 2.29-20.54 min). Extended FOV imaging added important information in 11/51 subjects (21.6%), in 6 cases (11.8%) of infection and in 5 cases (9.8%) by suggesting alternative diagnoses. CONCLUSION: The addition of extended FOV MRI in young children with suspected osteomyelitis added important clinical information in 21.6% of patients while only adding a median of 6:51 min to the examination. It is our experience that in children </=5 years of age with suspected osteomyelitis, extended FOV imaging adds important information and may result in changes in management.",Extended field of view magnetic resonance imaging for suspected osteomyelitis in very young children: is it useful?
"Purpose: Little is known about the phenotypes, diagnoses, and sex of rearing of infants with atypical genital development in the United States. As part of a multicenter study of these infants, we have provided a baseline report from US difference/disorder of sex development clinics describing the diagnoses, anatomic features, and sex of rearing. We also determined whether consensus guidelines are followed for sex designation in the United States. Methods: Eligible participants had moderate-to-severe genital atypia, were aged <3 years, and had not undergone previous genitoplasty. Karyotype, genetic diagnosis, difference/disorder of sex development etiology, family history, and sex of rearing were collected. Standardized examinations were performed. Results: Of 92 subjects, the karyotypes were 46,XX for 57%, 46,XY for 34%, and sex chromosome abnormality for 9%. The median age at the baseline evaluation was 8.8 months. Most 46,XX subjects (91%) had congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and most 46,XY subjects (65%) did not have a known diagnosis. Two individuals with CAH underwent a change in sex of rearing from male to female within 2 weeks of birth. The presence of a uterus and shorter phallic length were associated with female sex of rearing. The most common karyotype and diagnosis was 46,XX with CAH, followed by 46,XY with an unknown diagnosis. Phenotypically, atypical genitalia have been most commonly characterized by abnormal labioscrotal tissue, phallic length, and urethral meatus location. Conclusions: An increased phallic length was positively associated with rearing male. Among the US centers studied, sex designation followed the Consensus Statement recommendations. Further study is needed to determine whether this results in patient satisfaction.","Baseline Characteristics of Infants With Atypical Genital Development: Phenotypes, Diagnoses, and Sex of Rearing."
"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in commercial motor vehicle operators (CMVOs); however, polysomnography (PSG), the gold-standard diagnostic test, is expensive and inconvenient for screening. OSA is associated with changes in heart rate and voltage on electrocardiography (EKG). We evaluated the utility of EKG parameters in identifying CMVOs at greater risk for sleepiness-related crashes (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] >/= 30 events/h). METHODS: In this prospective study of CMVOs, we performed EKGs with concurrent PSG, and calculated the respiratory power index (RPI) on EKG, a surrogate for AHI calculated from PSG. We evaluated the utility of two-stage predictive models using simple clinical measures (age, body mass index [BMI], neck circumference, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, and the Multi-Variable Apnea Prediction [MVAP] score) in the first stage, followed by RPI in a subset as the second-stage. We assessed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and negative posttest probability (NPTP) for this two-stage approach and for RPI alone. RESULTS: The best-performing model used the MVAP, which combines BMI, age, and sex with three OSA symptoms, in the first stage, followed by RPI in the second. The model yielded an estimated (95% confidence interval) AUC of 0.883 (0.767-0.924), sensitivity of 0.917 (0.706-0.962), and NPTP of 0.034 (0.015-0.133). Predictive characteristics were similar using a model with only BMI as the first-stage screen. CONCLUSIONS: A two-stage model that combines BMI or the MVAP score in the first stage, with EKG in the second, had robust discriminatory power to identify severe OSA in CMVOs.",Screening for Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Commercial Drivers Using EKG-Derived Respiratory Power Index.
"OBJECTIVE:: The Craniofacial microsomia: Longitudinal Outcomes in Children pre-Kindergarten (CLOCK) study is a longitudinal cohort study of neurobehavioral outcomes in infants and toddlers with craniofacial microsomia (CFM). In this article, we review the data collection and methods used to characterize this complex condition and describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort. SETTING:: Craniofacial and otolaryngology clinics at 5 study sites. PARTICIPANTS:: Infants with CFM and unaffected infants (controls) ages 12 to 24 months were recruited from the same geographical regions and followed to age 36 to 48 months. METHODS:: Phenotypic, neurodevelopmental, and facial expression assessments were completed during the first and third waves of data collection (time 1 and time 3, respectively). Medical history data were taken at both of these time points and during an intermediate parent phone interview (time 2). RESULTS:: Our cohort includes 108 cases and 84 controls. Most cases and controls identified as white and 55% of cases and 37% of controls identified as Hispanic. Nearly all cases had microtia (95%) and 59% had mandibular hypoplasia. Cases received extensive clinical care in infancy, with 59% receiving care in a craniofacial clinic and 28% experiencing at least one surgery. Study visits were completed at a study site (92%) or at the participant's home (8%).

"The human IL22RA2 gene co-produces three protein isoforms in dendritic cells [IL-22 binding protein isoform-1 (IL-22BPi1), IL-22BPi2, and IL-22BPi3]. Two of these, IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3, are capable of neutralizing the biological activity of IL-22. The function of IL-22BPi1, which differs from IL-22BPi2 through an in-frame 32-amino acid insertion provided by an alternatively spliced exon, remains unknown. Using transfected human cell lines, we demonstrate that IL-22BPi1 is secreted detectably, but at much lower levels than IL-22BPi2, and unlike IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3, is largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As opposed to IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3, IL-22BPi1 is incapable of neutralizing or binding to IL-22 measured in bioassay or assembly-induced IL-22 co-folding assay. We performed interactome analysis to disclose the mechanism underlying the poor secretion of IL-22BPi1 and identified GRP78, GRP94, GRP170, and calnexin as main interactors. Structure-function analysis revealed that, like IL-22BPi2, IL-22BPi1 binds to the substrate-binding domain of GRP78 as well as to the middle domain of GRP94. Ectopic expression of wild-type GRP78 enhanced, and ATPase-defective GRP94 mutant decreased, secretion of both IL-22BPi1 and IL-22BPi2, while neither of both affected IL-22BPi3 secretion. Thus, IL-22BPi1 and IL-22BPi2 are bona fide clients of the ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94. However, only IL-22BPi1 activates an unfolded protein response (UPR) resulting in increased protein levels of GRP78 and GRP94. Cloning of the IL22RA2 alternatively spliced exon into an unrelated cytokine, IL-2, bestowed similar characteristics on the resulting protein. We also found that CD14(++)/CD16(+) intermediate monocytes produced a higher level of IL22RA2 mRNA than classical and non-classical monocytes, but this difference disappeared in immature dendritic cells (moDC) derived thereof. Upon silencing of IL22RA2 expression in moDC, GRP78 levels were significantly reduced, suggesting that native IL22RA2 expression naturally contributes to upregulating GRP78 levels in these cells. The IL22RA2 alternatively spliced exon was reported to be recruited through a single mutation in the proto-splice site of a Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposon sequence in the ape lineage. Our work suggests that positive selection of IL-22BPi1 was not driven by IL-22 antagonism as in the case of IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3, but by capacity for induction of an UPR response.",Long Interleukin-22 Binding Protein Isoform-1 Is an Intracellular Activator of the Unfolded Protein Response.
"With the urgency to treat patients more effectively for opioid use disorder in the midst of the opioid epidemic, a key area for precision medicine is to improve individualized medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. The expansion of medication-assisted treatment is a key to reducing illicit opioid use, preventing opioid overdose deaths, and reducing the comorbidities and societal impacts of opioid use disorder. The most common medication for opioid use disorder will soon be buprenorphine. Research to date shows the successful impact of buprenorphine treatment, including the pharmacogenomics of buprenorphine response and treatment efficacy. Buprenorphine is also a promising treatment for depression and anxiety, and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). However, the rates of success with medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder, particularly at the beginning of treatment, still show many individuals relapsing to illicit opioid use.

"Nonsense suppressors (NonSups) induce ""readthrough"", i.e., the selection of near cognate tRNAs at premature termination codons and insertion of the corresponding amino acid into nascent polypeptide. Prior readthrough measurements utilized contexts in which NonSups can promote readthrough directly, by binding to one or more of the components of the protein synthesis machinery, or indirectly, by several other mechanisms. Here we utilize a new, highly purified in vitro assay to measure exclusively direct nonsense suppressor-induced readthrough. Of 16 NonSups tested, 12 display direct readthrough, with results suggesting that such NonSups act by at least two different mechanisms. In preliminary work we demonstrate the potential of single molecule fluorescence energy transfer measurements to elucidate mechanisms of NonSup-induced direct readthrough, which will aid efforts to identify NonSups having improved clinical efficacy.",New in Vitro Assay Measuring Direct Interaction of Nonsense Suppressors with the Eukaryotic Protein Synthesis Machinery.
"Neurons in the CNS establish thousands of en passant synapses along their axons. Robust neurotransmission depends on the replenishment of synaptic components in a spatially precise manner. Using live-cell microscopy and single-molecule reconstitution assays, we find that the delivery of synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) to en passant synapses in hippocampal neurons is specified by an interplay between the kinesin-3 KIF1A motor and presynaptic microtubules. Presynaptic sites are hotspots of dynamic microtubules rich in GTP-tubulin. KIF1A binds more weakly to GTP-tubulin than GDP-tubulin and competes with end-binding (EB) proteins for binding to the microtubule plus end. A disease-causing mutation within KIF1A that reduces preferential binding to GDP- versus GTP-rich microtubules disrupts SVP delivery and reduces presynaptic release upon neuronal stimulation. Thus, the localized enrichment of dynamic microtubules along the axon specifies a localized unloading zone that ensures the accurate delivery of SVPs, controlling presynaptic strength in hippocampal neurons.",Kinesin-3 Responds to Local Microtubule Dynamics to Target Synaptic Cargo Delivery to the Presynapse.
"Autophagy is an essential degradative pathway that maintains neuronal homeostasis and prevents axon degeneration. However, the mechanisms of autophagy in neurons are only beginning to be understood. To address this fundamental gap in knowledge, we have established several key methodologies for live-cell imaging and quantitative analysis of autophagy in primary hippocampal neurons. Using these methods, we have defined compartment-specific dynamics of autophagy in real-time under basal versus stress conditions. For example, we have characterized autophagosome biogenesis in the distal axon and subsequent retrograde transport to the soma for degradation. Autophagosomes are also generated locally within the soma. In contrast to the axon, the majority of autophagosomes in dendrites are stationary, while some exhibit bidirectional movement. These studies establish an initial road map for autophagosome dynamics in each compartment of the neuron and set the stage for a more detailed understanding of neuronal autophagy in stress and disease.",Methods for Imaging Autophagosome Dynamics in Primary Neurons.

"The diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis can be difficult, with a substantial proportion misdiagnosed based on clinical features and laboratory tests alone. Accordingly, advanced imaging with ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and/or magnetic resonance imaging has become routine for most children undergoing diagnostic evaluation for appendicitis. There is increasing interest in the use of US as the primary imaging modality and reserving CT as a secondary diagnostic modality in equivocal cases. Magnetic resonance imaging, using a rapid protocol, without contrast or sedation, has been found to be highly sensitive and specific in the evaluation of children with acute right lower quadrant pain in a number of studies. Because magnetic resonance imaging has the advantage over CT of not using contrast or ionizing radiation, it may replace CT in many instances, whether after US as part of a stepwise imaging algorithm or as a primary imaging modality. Accessibility and cost, however, limit its more widespread use currently.",Appendicitis: Role of MRI.
"It is highly unusual for learners to leave medical training in the United States even though some individuals' goals may change and others may not achieve expected competence. There are a number of possible reasons for this: (1) students may feel that they have progressed too far into their careers and amassed too much debt to leave medical training; (2) students may be allowed to graduate despite marginal performance; and (3) students may have entered medical training with risk factors for poor performance that were not addressed. As stewards of the educational process, medical educators have an ethical obligation to students and the public to create off-ramps, or points along the educational continuum at which learners can reassess their goals and educators can assess competence, that allow students to leave medicine.Given the nationwide focus on physician health and wellness, the authors believe the creation of options to leave medical training without compromising one's self-esteem or incurring unmanageable debt (i.e., compassionate off-ramps) is a moral imperative. The practice of medicine should not be an exercise in survival; it should allow people to develop and thrive over the course of their careers. Offering students options to make use of the medical competencies they have accumulated in other attractive careers would enable medical educators to behave compassionately toward individual students and fulfill their societal obligation to graduate competent and committed physicians. To this end, the authors present six recommendations for consideration.",Providing Compassionate Off-Ramps for Medical Students Is a Moral Imperative.
"PURPOSE: To compare the prevalence and characteristics of shoulder osseous and soft tissue findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with respect to skeletal maturation in symptomatic pediatric baseball players without a history of acute trauma. METHODS: The IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study analyzed 87 consecutive pediatric baseball players (86 boys and 1 girl; mean age, 15.4 +/- 2.1 years) with shoulder MRI performed between March 1, 2012 and September 30, 2017. In consensus, two radiologists assessed the MRI studies for findings involving the humerus, the glenoid, the labrum, the rotator cuff, and the acromioclavicular joint. Exact Cochran-Armitage trend and Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square tests were used to investigate the association between these findings and skeletal maturation. RESULTS: The mean ages between players who are skeletally immature (37 shoulders), maturing (26 shoulders), and matured (24 shoulders) were significantly different (p < 0.001). Bone marrow edema (p < 0.001) and sclerosis (p < 0.001) within the proximal humeral metaphysis decreased with skeletal maturation. Glenoid remodeling (p = 0.038) was more severe in the skeletally immature players and the prevalence of Bennett lesions (p = 0.048) increased with skeletal maturation. The prevalence of labral tears, rotator cuff tendinosis, and acromioclavicular joint separation did not significantly change with skeletal maturation. CONCLUSIONS: The change in the prevalence of findings within the proximal humerus and glenoid with skeletal maturation suggest differences in the distribution of stress within the shoulders of pediatric baseball players during development.",Maturation-dependent findings in the shoulders of pediatric baseball players on magnetic resonance imaging.

"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The American Academy of Pediatrics 2014 bronchiolitis guidelines recommend against the routine use of continuous pulse oximetry (CPO) because it has been implicated in prolonging the length of stay (LOS). At our institution, infants admitted with bronchiolitis were monitored by using CPO during the entire hospital stay and intermittent desaturations <90% appeared to delay discharge. This quality improvement initiative was designed to reduce the LOS by decreasing the use of CPO in stable infants with nonsevere bronchiolitis. METHODS: The quality improvement project was implemented on the inpatient units of 2 community hospitals during the 2016 and 2017 bronchiolitis seasons. In cycle 1 (January 2016 to April 2016), the bronchiolitis pathway from the associated quaternary children's hospital was used to (1) limit the use of CPO to patients with severe bronchiolitis and those at high risk for apnea or severe disease, (2) discontinue CPO as patients improved and stabilized, and (3) standardize discharge criteria. In cycle 2 (November 2016 to April 2017), the clinical pathway was adopted. The main outcome measure was LOS, measured from the time of the admission order to the time of the discharge order. Process measures included compliance with the interventions. RESULTS: The project included 373 patients, 180 preintervention and 193 postintervention. The average LOS decreased by 20 hours, from 53 hours at baseline to 33 hours in cycle 2. No adverse events were noted, and there was no significant change in the number of emergency department revisits and readmissions within 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, LOS was successfully reduced in bronchiolitis patients by using a clinical pathway that limited CPO to patients with severe bronchiolitis and those at risk for severe disease or apnea.",Successful Use of Quality Improvement Methodology to Reduce Inpatient Length of Stay in Bronchiolitis Through Judicious Use of Intermittent Pulse Oximetry.
"Comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests are increasingly used as first-line tests in the evaluation of patients with suspected heritable disease. Despite major technical simplifications, these assays still pose significant challenges for molecular testing laboratories. Existing professional guidelines and recommendations provide a framework for laboratories implementing such tests, but in-depth, concrete guidance is generally not provided. Consequently, there is variability in how laboratories interpret and subsequently implement these regulatory frameworks. To address the need for more detailed guidance, the College of American Pathologists with representation from the Association for Molecular Pathologists assembled a working group to create a practical resource for clinical laboratories. This initial work is focused on variant detection in the setting of inherited disease and provides structured worksheets that guide the user through the entire life cycle of an NGS test, including design, optimization, validation, and quality management with additional guidance for clinical bioinformatics. This resource is designed to be a living document that is publicly available and will be updated with user and expert feedback as the wet bench and bioinformatic landscapes continue to evolve. It is intended to facilitate the standardization of NGS testing across laboratories and therefore to improve patient care.",Designing and Implementing NGS Tests for Inherited Disorders: A Practical Framework with Step-by-Step Guidance for Clinical Laboratories.
"The scattering of neutrons can be used to provide information on the structure and dynamics of biological systems on multiple length and time scales. Pursuant to a National Science Foundation-funded workshop in February 2018, recent developments in this field are reviewed here, as well as future prospects that can be expected given recent advances in sources, instrumentation and computational power and methods. Crystallography, solution scattering, dynamics, membranes, labeling and imaging are examined. For the extraction of maximum information, the incorporation of judicious specific deuterium labeling, the integration of several types of experiment, and interpretation using high-performance computer simulation models are often found to be particularly powerful.",Neutron scattering in the biological sciences: progress and prospects.
"Molecular mechanisms driving disease course and response to therapy in ulcerative colitis (UC) are not well understood. Here, we use RNAseq to define pre-treatment rectal gene expression, and fecal microbiota profiles, in 206 pediatric UC patients receiving standardised therapy. We validate our key findings in adult and paediatric UC cohorts of 408 participants. We observe a marked suppression of mitochondrial genes and function across cohorts in active UC, and that increasing disease severity is notable for enrichment of adenoma/adenocarcinoma and innate immune genes. A subset of severity genes improves prediction of corticosteroid-induced remission in the discovery cohort; this gene signature is also associated with response to anti-TNFalpha and anti-alpha4beta7 integrin in adults. The severity and therapeutic response gene signatures were in turn associated with shifts in microbes previously implicated in mucosal homeostasis. Our data provide insights into UC pathogenesis, and may prioritise future therapies for nonresponders to current approaches.",Ulcerative colitis mucosal transcriptomes reveal mitochondriopathy and personalized mechanisms underlying disease severity and treatment response.

"In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that enables the investigation of the production and intracellular transport of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau protein in a neuron. We also investigate the aggregation of APP fragments into amyloid-beta (Abeta) as well as tau aggregation into tau oligomers and neurofibrillary tangles. Using the developed model, we investigate how Abeta aggregation can influence tau transport and aggregation in both the soma and the axon. We couple the Abeta and tau agglomeration processes by assuming that the value of the kinetic constant that describes the autocatalytic growth (self-replication) reaction step of tau aggregation is proportional to the Abeta concentration. The model predicts that APP and tau are distributed differently in the axon. While APP has a uniform distribution along the axon, tau's concentration first decreases and then increases towards the synapse. Abeta is uniformly produced along the axon while misfolded tau protein is mostly produced in the proximal axon. The number of Abeta and tau polymers originating from the axon is much smaller than the number of Abeta and tau polymers originating from the soma. The rate of production of misfolded tau polymers depends on how strongly their production is facilitated by Abeta.",Simulating the effect of formation of amyloid plaques on aggregation of tau protein.

"OBJECTIVE:: To better understand the capacity for orthodontic care, service features, and finances among members of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (ACPA). DESIGN:: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING:: ACPA-approved multidisciplinary cleft teams. PARTICIPANTS:: Cleft team coordinators. INTERVENTIONS:: Coordinators were asked to complete the survey working together with their orthodontists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:: Model for orthodontic care. RESULTS:: Coordinators from 82 out of 167 teams certified by ACPA completed the survey (response rate = 49.1%). Most orthodontists were private practice volunteers (48%) followed by university/hospital employed (22.8%). Care was often delivered in community private practice facilities (44.2%) or combination of university and private practice facilities (39.0%). Half of teams reported offering presurgical infant orthopedics (PSIO), with nasoalveolar molding being the most common. Cleft/craniofacial patients typically comprise 25% or less of the orthodontists' practices. The presence of a university/hospital-based orthodontist was associated with higher rates of offering PSIO ( P < .001) and an increased percentage dedication of their practice to cleft/craniofacial care ( P < .001). CONCLUSION:: Orthodontic models across ACPA-certified teams are highly varied. The employment of full-time craniofacial orthodontists is less common but is highly correlated with a practice with a high percentage of cleft care and the offering of advanced services such as PSIO. Future work should focus on how to effectively promote such roles for orthodontists to ensure high-level care for cleft/craniofacial patients requiring treatment from infancy through skeletal maturity.",Cleft and Craniofacial Team Orthodontic Care in the United States: A Survey of the ACPA.
"Active cell proliferation and turnover in the growth plate is essential for embryonic and postnatal bone growth. We performed a lineage tracing of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling responsive cells (Wnt-responsive cells) using Axin2(CreERT2) ;Rosa26ZsGreen mice and found a novel cell population that resides in the outermost layer of the growth plate facing the Ranvier's groove (RG; the perichondrium adjacent to growth plate). These Wnt-responsive cells rapidly expanded and contributed to formation of the outer growth plate from the neonatal to the growing stage but stopped expanding at the young adult stage when bone longitudinal growth ceases. In addition, a second Wnt-responsive sporadic cell population was localized within the resting zone of the central part of the growth plate during the postnatal growth phase. While it induced ectopic chondrogenesis in the RG, ablation of beta-catenin in the Wnt-responsive cells strongly inhibited expansion of their descendants toward the growth plate. These findings indicate that the Wnt-responsive cell population in the outermost layer of the growth plate is a unique cell source of chondroprogenitors involving lateral growth of the growth plate and suggest that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates function of skeletal progenitors in a site- and stage-specific manner.

"OBJECTIVES: Eighteen years ago, the Institute of Medicine estimated that medical errors in hospital were a major cause of mortality. Since that time, reducing patient harm and improving the culture of patient safety have been national health care priorities. The study objectives were to describe the current state of patient safety in pediatric acute care settings and to assess whether modifiable features of organizations are associated with better safety culture. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study used 2015-2016 survey data on 177 hospitals in four U.S. states, including pediatric care in general hospitals and freestanding children's hospitals. Pediatric registered nurses providing direct patient care assessed hospital safety and the clinical work environment. Safety was measured by items from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Culture of Patient Safety survey. Hospital clinical work environment was measured by the National Quality Forum-endorsed Practice Environment Scale. RESULTS: A total of 1875 pediatric nurses provided an assessment of safety in their hospitals. Sixty percent of pediatric nurses gave their hospitals less than an excellent grade on patient safety; significant variation across hospitals was observed. In the average hospital, 46% of nurses report that mistakes are held against them and 28% do not feel safe questioning authority regarding unsafe practices. Hospitals with better clinical work environments received better patient safety grades. CONCLUSIONS: The culture of patient safety varies across U.S. hospital pediatric settings. In better clinical work environments, nurses report more positive safety culture and higher safety grades.",The Association of the Nurse Work Environment and Patient Safety in Pediatric Acute Care.
"WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Obstetric specialty societies recommend neuraxial anesthesia, when possible, for cesarean deliveryCurrent data regarding the association of obstetric anesthesiologist specialization and use of general anesthesia for cesarean delivery remain lacking WHAT THIS MANUSCRIPT TELLS US THAT IS NEW: Maternal and provider factors are strongly associated with use of general anesthesia for cesarean deliveryPatients receiving care from obstetric-specialized anesthesiologists are 29% less likely to receive general anesthesia for cesarean delivery BACKGROUND:: Guidelines for obstetric anesthesia recommend neuraxial anesthesia (i.e., spinal or epidural block) for cesarean delivery in most patients. Little is known about the association of anesthesiologist specialization in obstetric anesthesia with a patient's likelihood of receiving general anesthesia. The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare utilization of general anesthesia for cesarean delivery among patients treated by generalist versus obstetric-specialized anesthesiologists. METHODS: The authors studied patients undergoing cesarean delivery for live singleton pregnancies from 2013 through 2017 at one academic medical center. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record. The authors estimated the association of anesthesiologist specialization in obstetric anesthesia with the odds of receiving general anesthesia for cesarean delivery. RESULTS: Of the cesarean deliveries in our sample, 2,649 of 4,052 (65.4%) were performed by obstetric-specialized anesthesiologists, and 1,403 of 4,052 (34.6%) by generalists. Use of general anesthesia differed for patients treated by specialists and generalists (7.3% vs. 12.1%; P < 0.001). After adjustment, the odds of receiving general anesthesia were lower among patients treated by obstetric-specialized anesthesiologists among all patients (adjusted odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.92; P = 0.011), and in a subgroup analysis restricted to urgent or emergent cesarean deliveries (adjusted odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.99; P = 0.049). There was no association between provider specialization and the odds of receiving general anesthesia in a subgroup analysis restricted to evening or weekend deliveries (adjusted odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.03; P = 0.085). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment by an obstetric anesthesiologist was associated with lower odds of receiving general anesthesia for cesarean delivery; however, this finding did not persist in a subgroup analysis restricted to evening and weekend deliveries.",Anesthesiologist Specialization and Use of General Anesthesia for Cesarean Delivery.
"Heterozygous pathogenic variants in the FN1 gene, encoding fibronectin (FN), have recently been shown to be associated with a skeletal disorder in some individuals affected by spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with ""corner fractures"" (SMD-CF). The most striking feature characterizing SMD-CF is irregularly shaped metaphyses giving the appearance of ""corner fractures"". An array of secondary features, including developmental coxa vara, ovoid vertebral bodies and severe scoliosis, may also be present. FN is an important extracellular matrix component for bone and cartilage development. Here we report five patients affected by this subtype of SMD-CF caused by five novel FN1 missense mutations: p.Cys123Tyr, p.Cys169Tyr, p.Cys213Tyr, p.Cys231Trp and p.Cys258Tyr. All individuals shared a substitution of a cysteine residue, disrupting disulfide bonds in the FN type-I assembly domains located in the N-terminal assembly region. The abnormal metaphyseal ossification and ""corner fracture"" appearances were the most remarkable clinical feature in these patients. In addition, generalized skeletal fragility with low-trauma bilateral femoral fractures was identified in one patient. Interestingly, the distal femoral changes in this patient healed with skeletal maturation. Our report expands the phenotypic and genetic spectrum of the FN1-related SMD-CF and emphasizes the importance of FN in bone formation and possibly also in the maintenance of bone strength.","Novel fibronectin mutations and expansion of the phenotype in spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with ""corner fractures""."
"Kidney cysts can manifest as focal disease (simple and complex kidney cysts), affect a whole kidney (eg, multicystic dysplastic kidney or cystic dysplasia), or manifest as bilateral cystic disease (eg, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease [ARPKD] or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [ADPKD]). In children, as opposed to adults, a larger proportion of kidney cysts are due to genetic diseases (eg, HNF1B nephropathy, various ciliopathies, and tuberous sclerosis complex), and fewer patients have simple cysts or acquired cystic kidney disease. The purpose of this consensus statement is to provide clinical guidance on standardization of imaging tests to evaluate kidney cysts in children. A committee of international experts in pediatric nephrology, pediatric radiology, pediatric US, and adult nephrology prepared systematic literature reviews and formulated recommendations at a consensus meeting. The final statement was endorsed by the European Society of Pediatric Radiology, the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology, the European Society of Pediatric Nephrology, and reviewed by the European Reference Network for Rare Kidney Diseases. Main recommendations are as follows: US is the method of choice when assessing pediatric kidney cysts, with selected indications for MRI and contrast-enhanced US. CT should be avoided whenever possible because of ionizing radiation. Renal US yields essential diagnostic information in many cases. In patients with ARPKD or other ciliopathies, abdominal US is needed for diagnosis and screening of portal hypertension. US is usually sufficient for follow-up kidney imaging, but MRI can be valuable for clinical trials in patients with ADPKD or in older children with tuberous sclerosis complex to evaluate both kidney cysts and angiomyolipomas.",Imaging of Kidney Cysts and Cystic Kidney Diseases in Children: An International Working Group Consensus Statement.

"Impaired classical NF-kappaB pathway signaling causes reduced antibody responses to T-independent (TI) antigens. We investigated the potential reasons for defective TI responses in mice lacking the atypical inhibitory kappa B (IkappaB) protein of the NF-kappaB pathway, IkappaBNS. Analyses of the plasma cell compartment in vitro and in vivo after challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed significant decreases in the frequencies of plasma cells in the absence of IkappaBNS. In vitro activation of B cells via the B cell receptor or via Toll-like receptor 4 revealed that early activation events were unaffected in IkappaBNS-deficient B cells, while proliferation was reduced compared to in similarly stimulated wildtype (wt) B cells. IkappaBNS-deficient B cells also displayed impaired upregulation of the transmembrane activator and calcium modulator cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), which is essential for TI responses, and decreased sensitivity to TACI ligands upon stimulation. Furthermore, IkappaBNS-deficient B cells, in contrast to wt B cells, displayed altered expression of IRF4, Blimp-1 and Pax5 upon LPS-induced differentiation, indicating impaired transcriptional regulation of plasma cell generation.",TACI expression and plasma cell differentiation are impaired in the absence of functional IkappaBNS.
"BACKGROUND: Organochlorine pesticides are associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. A preliminary analysis from the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study suggested that heptachlor epoxide, a metabolite from an organochlorine pesticide extensively used in Hawaii, may be especially important. This was a cross sectional analysis to evaluate the association of heptachlor epoxide and other organochlorine compounds with Lewy pathology in an expanded survey of brain organochlorine residues from the longitudinal Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. METHODS: Organochlorines were measured in frozen occipital or temporal lobes in 705 brains using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Lewy pathology was identified using hematoxylin and eosin- and alpha-synuclein immunochemistry-stained sections from multiple brain regions. RESULTS: The prevalence of Lewy pathology was nearly doubled in the presence versus the absence of heptachlor epoxide (30.1% versus 16.3%, P < 0.001). Although associations with other compounds were weaker, hexachlorobenzene (P = 0.003) and alpha-chlordane (P = 0.007) were also related to Lewy pathology. Most of the latter associations, however, were a result of confounding from heptachlor epoxide. Neither compound was significantly related to Lewy pathology after adjustment for heptachlor epoxide. In contrast, the association of heptachlor epoxide with Lewy pathology remained significant after adjustments for hexachlorobenzene (P = 0.013) or alpha-chlordane (P = 0.005). Findings were unchanged after removal of cases of PD and adjustment for age and other characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Organochlorine pesticides are associated with the presence of Lewy pathology in the brain, even after exclusion of PD cases. Although most of the association is through heptachlor epoxide, the role of other organochlorine compounds is in need of clarification.

"Background: Sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. As facility-based births become more common, the proportion of neonatal deaths due to hospital-onset sepsis has increased. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in a neonatal intensive care unit in Zambia where we implemented a multi-faceted infection prevention and control (IPC) bundle consisting of IPC training, text message reminders, alcohol hand rub, enhanced environmental cleaning, and weekly bathing of babies >/=1.5 kg with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate. Hospital-associated sepsis, bloodstream infection (BSI), and mortality (>3 days after admission) outcome data were collected for 6 months prior to and 11 months after bundle implementation. Results: Most enrolled neonates had a birthweight >/=1.5 kg (2131/2669, 79.8%). Hospital-associated mortality was lower during the intervention than baseline period (18.0% vs 23.6%). Total mortality was lower in the intervention than prior periods. Half of enrolled neonates (50.4%) had suspected sepsis; 40.8% of cultures were positive. Most positive blood cultures yielded a pathogen (409/549, 74.5%), predominantly Klebsiella pneumoniae (289/409, 70.1%). The monthly rate and incidence density rate of suspected sepsis were lower in the intervention period for all birthweight categories, except babies weighing <1.0 kg. The rate of BSI with pathogen was also lower in the intervention than baseline period. Conclusions: A simple IPC bundle can reduce sepsis and death in neonates hospitalized in high-risk, low-resource settings. Further research is needed to validate these findings in similar settings and to identify optimal implementation strategies for improvement and sustainability. Clinical Trials Registration.

"OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding received by Emergency Medicine (EM) to the specialties of Family Medicine, Neurology, Orthopedics, Pediatrics and Psychiatry over the 10-year period from 2008 to 2017. METHODS: The NIH database of both submitted and funded NIH applications were queried and crossed with the departmental affiliation of the principal investigator. Research Grants were defined by the following activity codes: R, P, M, S, K, U (excluding UC6), DP1, DP2, DP3, DP4, DP5, D42 and G12. Derived data were further analyzed using information from the Association of American Medical Colleges to determine the relationship between the number of awards and the size of respective teaching and research faculty. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2017, there were a total of 14,676 funded grants across included specialties with total monetary support of $6.002 billion. Of these funded grants, 250 (1.7%) were from EM principal investigators which corresponded to total support of $89,453,635 (1.5% of overall dollars). There was an increase in total support after 2012 in EM, however when compared to the other specialties, EM investigators submitted relatively fewer grants and awarded grants were funded by a wider distribution of NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other select specialties, EM investigators accounted for a small proportion of grants submitted and funded over the past decade. Though findings illustrate promising trends, to foster success, more submitted grant applications are needed from within EM along with systematic approaches to support faculty members in their pursuit of NIH funding.",A comparative analysis of National Institutes of Health research support for emergency medicine - 2008 to 2017.
"BACKGROUND: Medical student and resident participation in short-term international trips for trainees (STINTTs) has increased in the past few decades. However, there has been no systematic review of trainees' actual ethical experiences. The authors sought to identify what ethical issues medical trainees encounter during STINTTs, as elicited by and reported in peer-reviewed, quantitative and qualitative research papers. METHODS: The authors systematically searched five academic databases finding 659 unique titles and abstracts. The authors applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to these titles and abstracts resulting in fourteen papers, which were analyzed using qualitative thematic synthesis. RESULTS: The qualitative analysis of the papers generated four themes: (1) Trainees' Concerns Over Perpetuating Medical Tourism; (2) Struggling to Identify and Balance the Benefits and Harms of STINTTs; (3) The Complicated Trainee Mens (mind); and (4) Ethical Situations Encountered by Trainees. The fourth theme, which was the largest, was further divided into (a) Navigating social and cultural dynamics, (b) Trainees' experiences related to the learner role, and (c) Ethical situations not qualifying for other catagories. Some of these issues reported in the empirical research papers are well represented in the broader literature on STINTTs, while others were less so-such as mistreatment of trainees. All included papers were published after 2010, and comprised a total of less than 170 medical trainees. CONCLUSIONS: Medical trainees report experiencing a wide range of ethical challenges during short-term international trips in which they engage in clinical or research activities. The authors call educators' attention to specific challenges that trainees face. The relevant literature covering US and Canadian STINTTs is relatively young and largely qualitative. The authors briefly sketch a program for expanding the research on this increasingly common educational experience.",The ethical experiences of trainees on short-term international trips: a systematic qualitative synthesis.
"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection exists as a complex mixture of genetically distinct viruses, commonly referred to as a ""quasispecies."" Quasispecies complexity can vary substantially during the course of natural infection as a consequence of viral population ""bottlenecking."" This occurs at the time of transmission from one individual to the next and during the course of chronic infection of an individual when adaptive immune responses eliminate certain viruses but allow others to escape and expand. Antiviral treatment with drugs that fail to eradicate virus can also lead to virus population bottlenecks and emergence of drug-resistant variants. Single genome sequencing (SGS) combined with mathematical modeling and phylogenetic inference is a recently described approach for characterizing the HCV quasispecies in unprecedented detail, allowing for the first time the retention of genetic linkage across genes and near full-length genomes and precise identification of transmitted/founder (T/F) genomes. Here, we describe the methodological approach to SGS and show how this strategy allows for the precise and unambiguous molecular identification of transmitted viruses as well as those that repopulate the body after drug or immune-mediated selective sweeps. This is an enabling experimental strategy that allows for a precise genetic, biologic, and antigenic characterization of HCV viruses that are responsible for transmission and persistence. Such an approach can be particularly valuable to future HCV vaccine design efforts, as it has been for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).",Molecular Identification of Transmitted/Founder Hepatitis C Viruses and Their Progeny by Single Genome Sequencing.
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is rapidly emerging as one of the most promising therapies for hematologic malignancies. Two CAR T products were recently approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of patients up to age 25 years with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and/or adults with large B cell lymphoma. Many more CAR T products, as well as other immunotherapies, including various immune cell- and bi-specific antibody-based approaches that function by activation of immune effector cells, are in clinical development for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. These therapies are associated with unique toxicities of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. The assessment and grading of these toxicities vary considerably across clinical trials and across institutions, making it difficult to compare the safety of different products and hindering the ability to develop optimal strategies for management of these toxicities. Moreover, some aspects of these grading systems can be challenging to implement across centers. Therefore, in an effort to harmonize the definitions and grading systems for CRS and neurotoxicity, experts from all aspects of the field met on June 20 and 21, 2018, at a meeting supported by the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) in Arlington, VA. Here we report the consensus recommendations of that group and propose new definitions and grading for CRS and neurotoxicity that are objective, easy to apply, and ultimately more accurately categorize the severity of these toxicities. The goal is to provide a uniform consensus grading system for CRS and neurotoxicity associated with immune effector cell therapies, for use across clinical trials and in the postapproval clinical setting.",ASBMT Consensus Grading for Cytokine Release Syndrome and Neurologic Toxicity Associated with Immune Effector Cells.

"MYH7-related disease (MRD) is the most common hereditary primary cardiomyopathy (CM), with pathogenic MYH7 variants accounting for approximately 40% of familial hypertrophic CMs. MRDs may also present as skeletal myopathies, with or without CM. Since pathogenic MYH7 variants result in highly variable clinical phenotypes, from mild to fatal forms of cardiac and skeletal myopathies, genotype-phenotype correlations are not always apparent, and translation of the genetic findings to clinical practice can be complicated. Data on genotype-phenotype correlations can help facilitate more specific and personalized decisions on treatment strategies, surveillance, and genetic counseling. We present a series of six MRD pedigrees with rare genotypes, encompassing various clinical presentations and inheritance patterns. This study provides new insights into the spectrum of MRD that is directly translatable to clinical practice.",Clinical diversity of MYH7-related cardiomyopathies: Insights into genotype-phenotype correlations.
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between findings of blinded reviews of preoperative drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) examinations using the VOTE Classification and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) surgical outcomes in a large multicenter, international cohort. METHODS: Retrospective, multi-center cohort study of adults without tonsillar hypertrophy who underwent pharyngeal surgery for OSA. The study included only participants without enlarged tonsils. Four independent reviewers performed blinded review of preoperative DISE videos using the VOTE Classification system and scoring of a primary structure contributing to airway obstruction. DISE findings were examined for an association with surgical outcomes with univariate analyses and multiple regression. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five study participants were included from 14 centers. Mean age was 51.4 +/- 11.8 years, and body mass index was 30.1 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2) . There was moderate interrater reliability (kappa = 0.40-0.60) for DISE findings. Oropharyngeal lateral wall-related obstruction was associated with poorer surgical outcomes (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.51; 95% CI 0.27, 0.93). Complete tongue-related obstruction was associated with a lower odds of surgical response in moderate to severe OSA (AOR 0.52; 95% CI 0.28, 0.98), with findings that were similar but not statistically significant in other analyses. Surgical outcomes were not clearly associated with the degree and configuration of velum-related obstruction or the degree of epiglottis-related obstruction. Surgical response was associated with tonsil size and body mass index (inversely). CONCLUSION: DISE findings concerning the oropharyngeal lateral walls and tongue may be the most important findings of this evaluation technique.

"BACKGROUND/AIM: Retinoid signaling is important for the maturation of growth-plate chondrocytes. The effect of retinoid receptor gamma (RARgamma) signaling on the expression of genes in hypertrophic chondrocytes is unclear. This study investigated the role of RARgamma signaling in regulation of hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The gene expression in mouse E17.5 tibial cartilage was examined by in situ hybridization analysis. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting were used for analysis of mRNA and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). RESULTS: mRNA expression of Rarg and connective tissue growth factor (Ccn2) was detected in maturing chondrocytes throughout the cartilaginous skeletal elements. In chondrogenic ATDC5 cells, an RARgamma agonist induced the gene expression of type-X collagen (Col10A1), transglutaminase-2 (Tg2), matrix metalloproteinase-13 (Mmp13), and Ccn2 mRNA, whereas a retinoic acid pan-agonist suppressed RARgamma agonist-stimulated gene expression. Phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated-kinases (pERK1/2), p-p38, and phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK) MAPK were time-dependently increased by RARgamma agonist treatment. Experimental p38 inhibition led to a severe drop in the RARgamma agonist-stimulated expressions of Col10A1, Tg2, Mmp13, and Ccn2 mRNA. CONCLUSION: RARgamma signaling is required for the differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes, with differential cooperation with p38 MAPK.",Retinoic Receptor Signaling Regulates Hypertrophic Chondrocyte-specific Gene Expression.
"BACKGROUND: Vertebral anterior overgrowth has been suggested as part of the etio-pathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, the link between 3D spinopelvic alignment and the vertebral anteroposterior height asymmetry in different scoliotic curves types and whether it deviates from the non-scoliotic controls, has not been studied. PURPOSE: We aimed to retrospectively describe the link between the anteroposterior vertebral height differences (DeltaAPVH) measured in the true sagittal plane of each vertebra and the spinopelvic parameters in three anatomical planes. METHODS: 30 AIS cases with primary thoracic curves, 28 with thoracolumbar/lumbar curves, and 20 non-scoliotic controls were included. All subjects had 3D reconstruction of the spine, generated from low-dose upright stereoradiography images. Pelvic incidence (PI), thoracic and lumbar coronal and sagittal curve measurements, and vertebral axial rotation were measured. The association between the spinopelvic parameters and DeltaAPVH were compared between the two AIS and control groups. RESULTS: DeltaAPVH at the apex of the curve was significantly different between the two AIS groups, as well as between both AIS groups and the controls and was related to the vertebral apical rotation (p < 0.05). Kyphosis and lordosis measurements were significantly related to the sum of the DeltaAPVH in thoracic and lumbar regions respectively in AIS group but not in non-scoliotic controls (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The DeltaAPVH depended on the scoliotic curve type and was significantly different from the controls only at the apical levels. Morphological changes in the scoliotic vertebrae, measured as anterior-posterior differences in the vertebral height, are related to the sagittal spinal profile suggesting the morphology of the vertebra contributes to the sagittal curvatures of the spine in AIS; nonetheless, such relationship between the vertebral morphology and the sagittal profile was not evident in non-scoliotic controls.",The Link Between the 3D Spino-pelvic Alignment and Vertebral Body morphology in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.
"BACKGROUND: Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), especially HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, are key mediators of the adaptive response to hypoxic stress and play essential roles in maintaining lung homeostasis. Human and animal genetics studies confirm that abnormal HIF correlates with pulmonary vascular pathology and chronic lung diseases, but it remains unclear whether endothelial cell HIF production is essential for microvascular health. The large airway has an ideal circulatory bed for evaluating histological changes and physiology in genetically modified rodents. METHODS: The tracheal microvasculature of mice, with conditionally deleted or overexpressed HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha, was evaluated for anatomy, perfusion, and permeability. Angiogenic signaling studies assessed vascular changes attributable to dysregulated HIF expression. An orthotopic tracheal transplantation model further evaluated the contribution of individual HIF isoforms in airway endothelial cells. RESULTS: The genetic deletion of Hif-2alpha but not Hif-1alpha caused tracheal endothelial cell apoptosis, diminished pericyte coverage, reduced vascular perfusion, defective barrier function, overlying epithelial abnormalities, and subepithelial fibrotic remodeling. HIF-2alpha promoted microvascular integrity in airways through endothelial angiopoietin-1/TIE2 signaling and Notch activity. In functional tracheal transplants, HIF-2alpha deficiency in airway donors accelerated graft microvascular loss, whereas HIF-2alpha or angiopoietin-1 overexpression prolonged transplant microvascular perfusion. Augmented endothelial HIF-2alpha in transplant donors promoted airway microvascular integrity and diminished alloimmune inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that the constitutive expression of endothelial HIF-2alpha is required for airway microvascular health.",Endothelial Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-2alpha Is Required for the Maintenance of Airway Microvasculature.
"BACKGROUND: Measuring fractional flow reserve (FFR) with a pressure wire remains underutilized because of the invasiveness of guide wire placement or the need for a hyperemic stimulus. FFR derived from routine coronary angiography (FFRangio) eliminates both of these requirements and displays FFR values of the entire coronary tree. The FFRangio Accuracy versus Standard FFR (FAST-FFR) study is a prospective, multicenter, international trial with the primary goal of determining the accuracy of FFRangio. METHODS: Coronary angiography was performed in a routine fashion in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. FFR was measured in vessels with coronary lesions of varying severity using a coronary pressure wire and hyperemic stimulus. Based on angiograms of the respective arteries acquired in >/=2 different projections, on-site operators blinded to FFR then calculated FFRangio using proprietary software. Coprimary end points were the sensitivity and specificity of the dichotomously scored FFRangio for predicting pressure wire-derived FFR using a cutoff value of 0.80. The study was powered to meet prespecified performance goals for sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Ten centers in the United States, Europe, and Israel enrolled a total of 301 subjects and 319 vessels meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria which were included in the final analysis. The mean FFR was 0.81 and 43% of vessels had an FFR</=0.80. The per-vessel sensitivity and specificity were 94% (95% CI, 88% to 97%) and 91% (86% to 95%), respectively, both of which exceeded the prespecified performance goals. The diagnostic accuracy of FFRangio was 92% overall and remained high when only considering FFR values between 0.75 to 0.85 (87%). FFRangio values correlated well with FFR measurements ( r=0.80, P<0.001) and the Bland-Altman 95% confidence limits were between -0.14 and 0.12. The device success rate for FFRangio was 99%. CONCLUSIONS: FFRangio measured from the coronary angiogram alone has a high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with pressure wire-derived FFR. FFRangio has the promise to substantially increase physiological coronary lesion assessment in the catheterization laboratory, thereby potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.

"The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project initiated within the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA2 data to support highly collaborative research activities. Its goal is to generate an informed and current understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across the iconic cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Initially, reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 available from public databases were integrated into a single, newly created site, www.brcaexchange.org. The purpose of the BRCA Exchange is to provide the community with a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. More than 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number found in the next-largest public database at the project's outset, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications. The data set is based on shared information from existing clinical databases-Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD)-as well as population databases, all linked to a single point of access. The BRCA Challenge has brought together the existing international Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium expert panel, along with expert clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers, all with a common goal of advancing our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. Ongoing work includes direct contact with national centers with access to BRCA1 and BRCA2 diagnostic data to encourage data sharing, development of methods suitable for extraction of genetic variation at the level of individual laboratory reports, and engagement with participant communities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2.",BRCA Challenge: BRCA Exchange as a global resource for variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.

"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical pathway implementation and quality improvement (QI) interventions to increase the percentage of infants with extremity fractures undergoing evaluation for suspected physical abuse, including skeletal survey (SS), and consultation with social work, and/or Child Protection Team. METHODS: Charts were retrospectively reviewed to establish percentage of infants less than 12 months old with extremity fractures undergoing an SS and consultation during the prepathway (January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013) and postpathway (January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015) periods. Using an Ishikawa framework, key process drivers were identified and additional QI interventions (clinical decision support and provider education) were developed and implemented. Impact of QI interventions on study metrics during active QI (July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016) and post-QI periods (July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016) was monitored using statistical process control charts. Logistic regression assessed predictors of obtaining an SS, consultation use, and occult fracture detection. RESULTS: Skeletal survey use pre- and postpathway averaged 40%, surpassing 60% on average during active QI and post-QI periods. Consultation performance averaged 46% pre- and postpathway, increasing to nearly 67% during active QI; consultation performance decreased during post-QI to 60%. A lack of trauma history and presence of femur or humerus fracture were associated with increased SS use and consultation (both P < 0.001). Overall 20% of SS revealed occult fractures.",Quality Improvement Initiative to Improve Abuse Screening Among Infants With Extremity Fractures.
"OBJECTIVE: To assess the availability and price of naloxone as well as pharmacy staff knowledge of the standing order for naloxone in Pennsylvania pharmacies. METHODS: We conducted a telephone audit study from December 2016 to April 2017 in which staff from Pennsylvania pharmacies were surveyed to evaluate naloxone availability, staff understanding of the naloxone standing order, and out-of-pocket cost of naloxone. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 682 of 758 contacted pharmacies (90% response rate). Naloxone was stocked (ie, available for dispensing) in 306 (45%) pharmacies surveyed. Of the 376 (55%) pharmacies that did not stock naloxone, 118 (31%) stated that they could place an order for naloxone for pickup within 1 business day. Responses by pharmacy staff to questions about key components of the standing order for naloxone were collected from 581 of the 682 pharmacies who participated in the survey (85%). Of the 581 pharmacy staff members who stated that they either stocked or could order naloxone, 64% correctly answered all questions pertaining to understanding of the naloxone standing order. The respective median out-of-pocket prices stated in the audit varied by formulation and ranged from $50 to $4000. Staff from national pharmacies were significantly more likely than staff from regional/local chain and non-chain pharmacies to correctly answer that a prescription was not required to obtain naloxone (68.5%, 57.7%, and 52.4% respectively, (P = 0.0045). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple barriers to naloxone access exist in pharmacies across a large, diverse state, despite the presence of a standing order to facilitate such access. Limited availability of naloxone in pharmacies, lack of knowledge or understanding by pharmacy staff of the standing order, and variability in out-of-pocket cost for this drug are among these potential barriers. Regulatory or legal incentives for pharmacies or drug manufacturers, education efforts directed toward pharmacy staff members, or other interventions may be needed to increase naloxone availability in pharmacies.",Naloxone Availability and Pharmacy Staff Knowledge of Standing Order for Naloxone in Pennsylvania Pharmacies.

"Nowadays, increasing longevity associated with declining cerebral nervous system functions, suggests the need for continued development of new imaging contrast mechanisms to support the differential diagnosis of age-related decline. In our previous papers, we developed a new imaging contrast metrics derived from anomalous diffusion signal representation and obtained from diffusion-weighted (DW) data collected by varying diffusion gradient strengths. Recently, we highlighted that the new metrics, named gamma-metrics, depended on the local inhomogeneity due to differences in magnetic susceptibility between tissues and diffusion compartments in young healthy subjects, thus providing information about myelin orientation and iron content within cerebral regions. The major structural modifications occurring in brain aging are myelinated fibers damage in nerve fibers and iron accumulation in gray matter nuclei. Therefore, we investigated the potential of gamma-metrics in relation to other conventional diffusion metrics such as DTI, DKI and NODDI in detecting age-related structural changes in white matter (WM) and subcortical gray matter (scGM). DW-images were acquired in 32 healthy subjects, adults and elderly (age range 20-77 years) using 3.0T and 12b-values up to 5000s/mm(2). Association between diffusion metrics and subjects' age was assessed using linear regression. A decline in mean gamma (Mgamma) in the scGM and a complementary increase in radial gamma (gamma perpendicular) in frontal WM, genu of corpus callosum and anterior corona radiata with advancing age were found. We suggested that the increase in gamma perpendicular might reflect declined myelin density, and Mgamma decrease might mirror iron accumulation. An increase in D// and a decrease in the orientation dispersion index (ODI) were associated with axonal loss in the pyramidal tracts, while their inverted trends within the thalamus were thought to be linked to reduced architectural complexity of nerve fibers. gamma-metrics together with conventional diffusion-metrics can more comprehensively characterize the complex mechanisms underlining age-related changes than conventional diffusion techniques alone.",Age-related microstructural and physiological changes in normal brain measured by MRI gamma-metrics derived from anomalous diffusion signal representation.
"Evaluating the sensitivity of biological models to various model parameters is a critical step towards advancing our understanding of biological systems. In this paper, we investigated sensitivity coefficients for a model simulating transport of tau protein along the axon. This is an important problem due to the relevance of tau transport and agglomeration to Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, such as some forms of parkinsonism. The sensitivity coefficients that we obtained characterize how strongly three observables (the tau concentration, average tau velocity, and the percentage of tau bound to microtubules) depend on model parameters. The fact that the observables strongly depend on a parameter characterizing tau transition from the retrograde to the anterograde kinetic states suggests the importance of motor-driven transport of tau. The observables are sensitive to kinetic constants characterizing tau concentration in the free (cytosolic) state only at small distances from the soma. Cytosolic tau can only be transported by diffusion, suggesting that diffusion-driven transport of tau only plays a role in the proximal axon. Our analysis also shows the location in the axon in which an observable has the greatest sensitivity to a certain parameter. For most parameters, this location is in the proximal axon. This could be useful for designing an experiment aimed at determining the value of this parameter. We also analyzed sensitivity of the average tau velocity, the total tau concentration, and the percentage of microtubule-bound tau to cytosolic diffusivity of tau and diffusivity of bound tau along the MT lattice. The model predicts that at small distances from the soma the effect of these two diffusion processes is comparable.",Investigating sensitivity coefficients characterizing the response of a model of tau protein transport in an axon to model parameters.

"The smallpox virus (variola) remains a bioterrorism threat since a majority of the human population has never been vaccinated. In the event of an outbreak, at least two drugs against different targets of variola are critical to circumvent potential viral mutants that acquire resistance. Vaccinia virus (VACV) is the model virus used in the laboratory for studying smallpox. The VACV processivity factor D4 is an ideal therapeutic target since it is both essential and specific for poxvirus replication. Recently, we identified a tripeptide (Gly-Phe-Ile) motif at the C-terminus of D4 that is conserved among poxviruses and is necessary for maintaining protein function. In the current work, a virtual screening for small molecule mimics of the tripeptide identified a thiophene lead that effectively inhibited VACV, cowpox virus, and rabbitpox virus in cell culture (EC50=8.4-19.7muM) and blocked in vitro processive DNA synthesis (IC50=13.4muM). Compound-binding to D4 was demonstrated through various biophysical methods and a dose-dependent retardation of the proteolysis of D4 proteins. This study highlights an inhibitor design strategy that exploits a susceptible region of the protein and identifies a novel scaffold for a broad-spectrum poxvirus inhibitor.",Mutation and structure guided discovery of an antiviral small molecule that mimics an essential C-Terminal tripeptide of the vaccinia D4 processivity factor.

"OBJECTIVE: To construct a grading score that predicts neurologic function 1 year after diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. METHODS: Three hundred eighty-two patients with detailed information and functional status at 1 year were studied. Factors associated with poor status (defined as modified Rankin Scale score >/=3) were identified and incorporated into a multivariate logistic regression model. This model was used to develop a 5-point prediction score, termed the anti-NMDAR Encephalitis One-Year Functional Status (NEOS) score. RESULTS: Intensive care unit admission (p < 0.001), treatment delay >4 weeks (p = 0.012), lack of clinical improvement within 4 weeks (p < 0.001), movement disorder (p = 0.001), central hypoventilation (p < 0.001), elevated CSF white blood cell count (p < 0.001), elevated CSF protein level (p = 0.027), and abnormal MRI (p = 0.002) were associated with 1-year functional status in univariate analysis. Intensive care unit admission, treatment delay >4 weeks, lack of clinical improvement within 4 weeks, abnormal MRI, and CSF white blood cell count >20 cells/muL were independent predictors for outcome in multivariate regression modeling. These 5 variables were assigned 1 point each to create the NEOS score. NEOS score strongly associated with the probability of poor functional status at 1 year (3% for 0 or 1 point to 69% for 4 or 5 points, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The NEOS score accurately predicts 1-year functional status in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. This score could help estimate the clinical course following diagnosis and may aid in identifying patients who could benefit from novel therapies.",A score that predicts 1-year functional status in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.
"The proteolytic conversion of factor V to factor Va is central for amplified flux through the blood coagulation cascade. Heterodimeric factor Va is produced by cleavage at three sites in the middle of factor V by thrombin, yielding an N terminus-derived heavy chain and a C terminus-derived light chain. Here, we show that light chain formation resulting from the C-terminal cleavage is the rate-limiting step in the formation of fully cleaved Va. This rate-limiting step also corresponded to and was sufficient for the ability of cleaved factor V to bind Xa and assemble into the prothrombinase complex. Meizothrombin, the proteinase intermediate in thrombin formation, cleaves factor V more slowly than does thrombin, resulting in a pronounced defect in the formation of the light chain. A approximately 100-fold reduced rate of meizothrombin-mediated light chain formation by meizothrombin corresponded to equally slow production of active cofactor and an impaired ability to amplify flux through the coagulation cascade initiated in plasma. We show that this defect arises from the occlusion of anion-binding exosite 2 in the catalytic domain by the covalently retained propiece in meizothrombin. Our findings provide structural insights into the prominent role played by exosite 2 in the rate-limiting step of factor V activation. They also bear on how factor V is converted into a cofactor capable of assembling into prothrombinase.",Occlusion of anion-binding exosite 2 in meizothrombin explains its impaired ability to activate factor V.

"BACKGROUND: We aimed to provide health practitioners greater insight into the public perception of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) use. Our objectives were to identify news media reports of children abandoning conventional treatment for traditional and complementary medicine, analyze the thematic content of these news articles and estimate the tonality portrayed. METHODS: LexisNexis and Factiva were searched for terms related to cancer, children and T&CM. Inclusion criteria were children less than 18 years, in curative phase of treatment who attempted to abandon conventional therapy for any traditional and complementary medicine use. A secondary search was performed in LexisNexis, Factiva and Google News Archive with the names of children in identified cases. Qualitative analysis of news media reports was completed using a grounded theory approach. Quantitative analysis of article sentiment was performed using a linear support vector machine. RESULTS: Seventeen cases occurring between 2002 and 2016 were included. Five main themes were identified: treatment as torture, power imbalances, rights of parents, evidence versus beliefs and the rights of Indigenous Peoples. Sentiment analysis revealed an overall negative tone, as demonstrated by 73% of the articles.

"OBJECTIVES: To examine cerebral autoregulation in children with complex mild traumatic brain injury. DESIGN: Prospective observational convenience sample. SETTING: PICU at a level I trauma center. PATIENTS: Children with complex mild traumatic brain injury (trauma, admission Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15 with either abnormal head CT, or history of loss of consciousness). INTERVENTIONS: Cerebral autoregulation was tested using transcranial Doppler ultrasound between admission day 1 and 8. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was prevalence of impaired cerebral autoregulation (autoregulation index < 0.4),determined using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and tilt testing. Secondary outcomes examined factors associated with and evolution and extent of impairment. Cerebral autoregulation testing occurred in 31 children 10 years (SD, 5.2 yr), mostly male (59%) with isolated traumatic brain injury (91%), median admission Glasgow Coma Scale 15, Injury Severity Scores 14.2 (SD, 7.7), traumatic brain injury due to fall (50%), preadmission loss of consciousness (48%), and abnormal head CT scan (97%). Thirty-one children underwent 56 autoregulation tests. Impaired cerebral autoregulation occurred in 15 children (48.4%) who underwent 19 tests; 68% and 32% of tests demonstrated unilateral and bilateral impairment, respectively. Compared with children on median day 6 of admission after traumatic brain injury, impaired autoregulation was most common in the first 5 days after traumatic brain injury (day 1: relative risk, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.9-7.3 vs day 2: relative risk, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.5 vs day 5: relative risk, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.7-2.3). Children with impaired autoregulation were older (12.3 yr [SD, 1.3 yr] vs 8.7 yr [SD, 1.1 yr]; p = 0.04) and tended to have subdural hematoma (64% vs 44%), epidural hematoma (29% vs 17%), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (36% vs 28%). Eight children (53%) were discharged home with ongoing impaired cerebral autoregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired cerebral autoregulation is common in children with complex mild traumatic brain injury, despite reassuring admission Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15. Children with complex mild traumatic brain injury have abnormal cerebrovascular hemodynamics, mostly during the first 5 days. Impairment commonly extends to the contralateral hemisphere and discharge of children with ongoing impaired cerebral autoregulation is common.","Prevalence, Evolution, and Extent of Impaired Cerebral Autoregulation in Children Hospitalized With Complex Mild Traumatic Brain Injury."

"In a previous study, we reported that intranasal delivery of both oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) to male macaques relaxes spontaneous social interactions, flattens the existing dominance hierarchy, and increases behavioral synchrony with other monkeys. Here we report that intranasal OT and AVP administration modulates the behaviors of female macaque monkeys, but in robustly different ways from males. Most notably, both neuropeptides increase threatening and vocalization behaviors of females when they encounter males, and these behaviors effectively increase the social status of females over males. While OT and AVP heighten the confrontational nature of intersexual encounters, both peptides relax interactions between females. Finally, as previously reported for males, treating an individual female monkey with OT or AVP significantly modulates the behavior of her non-treated partner. Together, these findings show that OT and AVP can either inhibit or promote aggression, depending on sex and behavioral context, and call for a more careful, systematic examination of the functions of these neuropeptides in both sexes, especially in the context of therapeutics for human social disorders.",Oxytocin and vasopressin increase male-directed threats and vocalizations in female macaques.
"OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of participation in an educational presentation on electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation in children on pediatric practitioners' ability to accurately interpret ECGs. STUDY DESIGN: Pediatric healthcare providers at a pediatric clinic with >65 000 visits/year were eligible to participate. A 1-hour ECG educational module that provided a systematic approach to ECG interpretation was presented to 8 providers who consented (6 pediatricians, 2 pediatric nurse practitioners). A test on 11 ECGs (normal, normal-variant, and abnormal ECGs) was given before and 2 weeks after the educational module. Outcomes included correct interpretation of each ECG as normal or abnormal and correct identification of specific ECG findings. Data analysis was descriptive and included chi(2) and Student t test. RESULTS: Mean score (SD) for correct interpretation of ECGs as normal or abnormal improved from 35% (48%) (95% CI 25.0-45.4) to 77% (42%) (95% CI 68.3-86.2) after the ECG educational module (P < .001). Mean (SD) pretest score for correct identification in the normal ECG category improved from 45% (50%) (95% CI 28.9-61.1) to 68% (47%) (95% CI 52.3-82.7) (P= .003). In the abnormal ECG category, correct identification improved from 31% (47%) (95% CI 17.6-44.9) to 83% (5%) (95% CI 72.4-94.3) after the module (P < .001).

"OBJECTIVES: To investigate racial/ethnic and gender inequities in the compensation and benefits of US health care workers and assess the potential impact of a $15-per-hour minimum wage on their economic well-being. METHODS: Using the 2017 Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey, we compared earnings, insurance coverage, public benefits usage, and occupational distribution of male and female health care workers of different races/ethnicities. We modeled the impact of raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour with different scenarios for labor demand. RESULTS: Of female health care workers, 34.9% of earned less than $15 per hour. Nearly half of Black and Latina female health care workers earned less than $15 per hour, and more than 10% lacked health insurance. A total of 1.7 million female health care workers and their children lived in poverty. Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would reduce poverty rates among female health care workers by 27.1% to 50.3%.

"Objective- Evening but not morning administration of low-dose aspirin has been reported to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The present study was designed to determine whether this phenomenon could be replicated in mice, and if so, whether a time-dependent effect of aspirin on blood pressure was because of alteration of circadian clock function. Approach and Results- We recapitulated the protective effect of aspirin (50 mug/d for 7 days) at zeitgeber time 0 (active-to-rest transit), but not at zeitgeber time 12, on a high-salt diet-induced increase of blood pressure. However, the time of aspirin administration did not influence expression of canonical clock genes or their acetylation. We used mouse Bmal1 and Per2-luciferase reporters expressed in U2OS cells to determine the real-time effect of aspirin on circadian function but found that the oscillation of bioluminescence was unaltered. Timing of aspirin administration also failed to alter urinary prostaglandin metabolites or catecholamines, or the acetylation of its COX-1 (cyclooxygenase-1) target in platelets. Conclusions- The time-dependent hypotensive effect of aspirin in humans has been recapitulated in hypertensive mice. However, this does not seem to reflect a direct impact of aspirin on circadian clocks or on acetylation of platelet COX-1.",Time-Dependent Hypotensive Effect of Aspirin in Mice.
"BACKGROUND: Practitioner communication is one of the most important influences and predictors of HPV vaccination uptake. The objective of this study was to conduct a latent class analysis characterizing pediatric practitioner HPV recommendation patterns. METHODS: Pediatric practitioners of the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) national network completed an online survey where they were presented with 5 hypothetical vignettes of well child visits and responded to questions. Questions asked about their use of communication strategies, assessments about the adolescent patient becoming sexually active in the next 2 years for decision-making about HPV vaccine recommendation, and peer norms. Latent class analysis characterized practitioner subgroups based on their response patterns to 10 survey questions. Multinomial logistic regression examined practitioner characteristics associated with each profile. RESULTS: Among 470 respondents, we identified three distinct practitioner HPV vaccine recommendation profiles: (1) Engagers (52%) followed national age-based guidelines, strongly recommended HPV vaccination, and perceived peers as strongly recommending; (2) Protocol Followers (20%) also strongly recommended HPV vaccination, but were less likely to engage families in a discussion about benefits; and (3) Ambivalent HPV Vaccine Recommenders (28%) delayed or did not recommend HPV vaccination and were more likely to use judgment about whether adolescents will become sexually active in the next two years. Practicing in a suburban setting was associated with twice the odds of being an Ambivalent Recommender relative to being an Engager (OR = 2.2; 95% CI:1.1-4.1). CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the importance of continued efforts to bolster practitioner adoption of evidence-based approaches to HPV vaccine recommendation especially among Ambivalent Recommenders.",HPV vaccine recommendation profiles among a national network of pediatric practitioners: understanding contributors to parental vaccine hesitancy and acceptance.
"PURPOSE.: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of ball-drills and repeated sprint ability training during the regular season in basketball players. METHODS.: Thirty players were randomized into 3 groups: ball-drills training (BDT, n=12; 4x4min, 3 vs 3 with 3min passive recovery), repeated sprint ability training (RSAT, n=9, 3x6x20m shuttle running with 20-sec and 4-min recovery) and general basketball training (GBT, n=9, basketball technical/tactical exercises), as control group. Players were tested, before and after 8 weeks of training using the following tests: VO2max, Squat Jump (SJ), Counter Movement Jump (CMJ), Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1), Agility T-test, line drill test, 5/10/20 m sprints, and blood lactate concentration (BLC).

RESULTS.: After training significant improvements were seen in Yo-Yo IR1 (BDT: p=0.014, ES+/-90%CI=0.8+/-0.3; RSAT: p=0.022, ES+/-90%CI=0.7+/-0.3), the agility T-test (BDT: p=0.018, ES+/-90%CI=0.7+/-0.5; RSAT: p=0.037, ES+/-90%CI=0.7+/-0.5), and the line drill test (BDT: p=0.010, ES+/-90%CI=0.3+/-0.1; RSAT: p<0.0001, ES+/-90%CI=0.4+/-0.1). In the RSAT group only 10-m sprint speeds (p=0.039, ES+/-90%CI=0.3+/-0.2) and BLC (p=0.004, ES+/-90%CI=0.8+/-1.1) were improved. Finally, technical skills were increased in BDT regarding dribbling (p=0.038, ES+/-90%CI=0.8+/-0.6), shooting (p=0.036, ES+/-90%CI=0.8+/-0.8), passing (p=0.034, ES+/-90%CI=0.9+/-0.3), rebounding (p=0.023, ES+/-90%CI=1.1+/-0.3), defense (p=0.042, ES+/-90%CI=0.5+/-0.5), and offense (p=0.044, ES+/-90%CI=0.4+/-0.4) skills. CONCLUSIONS.: BDT and RSAT are both effective in improving the physical performance of basketball players. BDT had also a positive impact on technical skills. Basketball strength and conditioning professionals should include BDT as a routine tool to improve technical skills and physical performance simultaneously throughout the regular training season.",Effects of Ball-Drills and Repeated Sprint Ability Training in Basketball Players.
"Adipose tissue, once viewed as an inert organ of energy storage, is now appreciated to be a central node for the dynamic regulation of systemic metabolism. There are three general types of adipose tissue: white, brown, and brown-in-white or ""beige"" fat. All three types of adipose tissue communicate extensively with other organs in the body, including skin, liver, pancreas, muscle, and brain, to maintain energy homeostasis. When energy intake chronically exceeds energy expenditure, obesity and its comorbidities can develop. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which different types of adipose tissues develop and function could uncover new therapies for combating disorders of energy imbalance. In this review, the recent findings on the transcriptional and chromatin-mediated regulation of brown and beige adipose tissue activity are highlighted.",Transcriptional Control of Brown and Beige Fat Development and Function.
"BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is a well-known complication of HSCT and carries high risk of morbidity and mortality. A lack of consistent non-invasive diagnostic criteria can delay diagnosis and lead to irreversible organ damage. METHODS: Serum samples of 100 patients that underwent HSCT at Cincinnati Children's Hospital were serially collected. Unbiased proteomic profiling by SELDI-TOF-MS was performed on serum from TA-TMA patients at baseline (pre-HSCT), 2 weeks before TMA diagnosis (pre-TMA), and at clinical TMA diagnosis. Two proteins with mass to charge ratios of 12-13 kDa were consistently elevated at the 2 week pre-TMA time point by SELDI-TOF, compared to control samples. Potential peptides were isolated and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on the Linear Trap Quadropole (LTQ). A MASCOT search identified haptoglobin fragments in the 12-17-kDa range. Western blot was performed to validate haptoglobin fragments as a potential biomarker. RESULTS: Western blot of TA-TMA patients showed haptoglobin fragments at 12, 14, and 17 kDa that varied between baseline, pre-TMA, and TMA time points for each patient. By densitometric analysis, the 17-kDa fragment in the pre-TMA samples differed significantly from TMA diagnosis (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the concentrations of the 12-kDa and 14-kDa fragments. CONCLUSION: The 17-kDa haptoglobin degradation product may represent a novel early serum biomarker for TA-TMA that could potentially allow for earlier diagnosis and intervention.",Haptoglobin degradation product as a novel serum biomarker for hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy.
"Recent studies have identified circular RNAs (circRNAs) expressed from the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) human DNA tumor viruses. To gain initial insights into the potential relevance of EBV circRNAs in virus biology and disease, we assessed the circRNAome of the interspecies homologue rhesus macaque lymphocryptovirus (rLCV) in a naturally occurring lymphoma from a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaque. This analysis revealed rLCV orthologues of the latency-associated EBV circular RNAs circRPMS1_E4_E3a and circEBNA_U. Also identified in two samples displaying unusually high lytic gene expression was a novel rLCV circRNA that contains both conserved and rLCV-specific RPMS1 exons and whose backsplice junctions flank an rLCV lytic origin of replication (OriLyt). Analysis of a lytic infection model for the murid herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) rhadinovirus identified a cluster of circRNAs near an MHV68 lytic origin of replication, with the most abundant of these, circM11_ORF69, spanning the OriLyt. Lastly, analysis of KSHV latency and reactivation models revealed the latency associated circRNA originating from the vIRF4 gene as the predominant viral circRNA. Together, the results of this study broaden our appreciation for circRNA repertoires in the Lymphocryptovirus and Rhadinovirus genera of gammaherpesviruses and provide evolutionary support for viral circRNA functions in latency and viral replication.IMPORTANCE Infection with oncogenic gammaherpesviruses leads to long-term viral persistence through a dynamic interplay between the virus and the host immune system. Critical for remodeling of the host cell environment after the immune responses are viral noncoding RNAs that modulate host signaling pathways without attracting adaptive immune recognition. Despite the importance of noncoding RNAs in persistent infection, the circRNA class of noncoding RNAs has only recently been identified in gammaherpesviruses. Accordingly, their roles in virus infection and associated oncogenesis are unknown. Here we report evolutionary conservation of EBV-encoded circRNAs determined by assessing the circRNAome in rLCV-infected lymphomas from an SIV-infected rhesus macaque, and we report latent and lytic circRNAs from KSHV and MHV68. These experiments demonstrate utilization of the circular RNA class of RNAs across 4 members of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily, and they identify orthologues and potential homoplastic circRNAs, implying conserved circRNA functions in virus biology and associated malignancies.",Comparative Analysis of Gammaherpesvirus Circular RNA Repertoires: Conserved and Unique Viral Circular RNAs.
"PURPOSE: To develop a dual-radiofrequency (RF), dual-echo, 3D ultrashort echo-time (UTE) pulse sequence and bone-selective image reconstruction for rapid high-resolution craniofacial MRI. METHODS: The proposed pulse sequence builds on recently introduced dual-RF UTE imaging. While yielding enhanced bone specificity by exploiting high sensitivity of short T2 signals to variable RF pulse widths, the parent technique exacts a 2-fold scan time penalty relative to standard dual-echo UTE. In the proposed method, the parent sequence's dual-RF scheme was incorporated into dual-echo acquisitions while radial view angles are varied every pulse-to-pulse repetition period. The resulting 4 echoes (2 for each RF) were combined by view-sharing to construct 2 sets of k-space data sets, corresponding to short and long TEs, respectively, leading to a 2-fold increase in imaging efficiency. Furthermore, by exploiting the sparsity of bone signals in echo-difference images, acceleration was achieved by solving a bone-sparsity constrained image reconstruction problem. In vivo studies were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed acceleration approaches in comparison to the parent method. RESULTS: The proposed technique achieves 1.1-mm isotropic skull imaging in 3 minutes without visual loss of image quality, compared to the parent technique (scan time = 12 minutes). Bone-specific images and corresponding 3D renderings of the skull were found to depict the expected craniofacial anatomy over the entire head. CONCLUSION: The proposed method is able to achieve high-resolution volumetric craniofacial images in a clinically practical imaging time, and thus may prove useful as a potential alternative to computed tomography.","Rapid dual-RF, dual-echo, 3D ultrashort echo time craniofacial imaging: A feasibility study."
"Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans. The effects are protean and highly variable, making a unified approach difficult. Nevertheless, commonalities have been identified and white papers with recommended evaluations and anticipatory guidance have been published. This review will cover the immune system in detail and discuss both the primary features and the secondary features related to thymic hypoplasia. A brief discussion of the other organ system involvement will be provided for context. The immune system, percolating throughout the body can impact the function of other organs through allergy or autoimmune disease affecting organs in deleterious manners. Our work has shown that the primary effect of thymic hypoplasia is to restrict T cell production. Subsequent homeostatic proliferation and perhaps other factors drive a Th2 polarization, most obvious in adulthood. This contributes to atopic risk in this population. Thymic hypoplasia also contributes to low regulatory T cells and this may be part of the overall increased risk of autoimmunity. Collectively, the effects are complex and often age-dependent. Future goals of improving thymic function or augmenting thymic volume may offer a direct intervention to ameliorate infections, atopy, and autoimmunity.",Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome.
"Background: EXamining everolimus In a Study of Tuberous sclerosis 3 (EXIST-3) demonstrated significantly reduced seizure frequency (SF) with everolimus vs placebo. In this study, we evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of everolimus for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated treatment-refractory seizures. Methods: After completion of the core phase, patients could enter an open-label extension phase and receive everolimus (target exposure, 3-15 ng/mL) for >/=48 weeks. Efficacy end points included change from baseline in average weekly SF expressed as response rate (RR, >/=50% reduction) and median percentage reduction (PR). Results: Of 366 patients, 361 received everolimus in core/extension phases. The RR was 31% (95% CI, 26.2-36.1; N = 352) at week 18, 46.6% (95% CI, 40.9-52.5; N = 298) at 1 year, and 57.7% (95% CI, 49.7-65.4; N = 163) at 2 years. Median PR in SF was 31.7% (95% CI, 28.5-36.1) at week 18, 46.7% (95% CI, 40.2-54) at 1 year, and 56.9% (95% CI, 50-68.4) at 2 years. Ninety-five patients (26.3%) discontinued everolimus before 2 years; 103 (28.5%) had <2 years of follow-up at study cutoff, and 40% were exposed to everolimus for >/=2 years. An analysis classifying discontinued patients as nonresponders showed an RR of 30.2% (95% CI, 25.5-35.2; N = 361) at week 18, 38.8% (95% CI, 33.7-44.1; N = 358) at 1 year, and 41% (95% CI, 34.6-47.7; N = 229) at 2 years, suggesting sustained benefit over time. The incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) (any cause) was 40.2%, and 13% discontinued because of AEs (pneumonia [1.7%] and stomatitis [1.4%]). Two deaths were suspected to be treatment-related (pneumonia and septic shock). Conclusions: Sustained reductions in TSC-associated treatment-refractory seizures over time were achieved with adjunctive everolimus. The safety profile was consistent with the core phase with no new safety concerns. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that long-term everolimus therapy reduces SF in patients with TSC-associated treatment-refractory seizures.",Everolimus for treatment-refractory seizures in TSC: Extension of a randomized controlled trial.
"Background: One strategy for addressing missing heritability in genome-wide association study is gene-gene interaction analysis, which, unlike a single gene approach, involves high-dimensionality. The multifactor dimensionality reduction method (MDR) has been widely applied to reduce multi-levels of genotypes into high or low risk groups. The Cox-MDR method has been proposed to detect gene-gene interactions associated with the survival phenotype by using the martingale residuals from a Cox model. However, this method requires a cross-validation procedure to find the best SNP pair among all possible pairs and the permutation procedure should be followed for the significance of gene-gene interactions. Recently, the unified model based multifactor dimensionality reduction method (UM-MDR) has been proposed to unify the significance testing with the MDR algorithm within the regression model framework, in which neither cross-validation nor permutation testing are needed. In this paper, we proposed a simple approach, called Cox UM-MDR, which combines Cox-MDR with the key procedure of UM-MDR to identify gene-gene interactions associated with the survival phenotype. Results: The simulation study was performed to compare Cox UM-MDR with Cox-MDR with and without the marginal effects of SNPs. We found that Cox UM-MDR has similar power to Cox-MDR without marginal effects, whereas it outperforms Cox-MDR with marginal effects and more robust to heavy censoring. We also applied Cox UM-MDR to a dataset of leukemia patients and detected gene-gene interactions with regard to the survival time. Conclusion: Cox UM-MDR is easily implemented by combining Cox-MDR with UM-MDR to detect the significant gene-gene interactions associated with the survival time without cross-validation and permutation testing. The simulation results are shown to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, which achieves at least the same power as Cox-MDR in most scenarios, and outperforms Cox-MDR when some SNPs having only marginal effects might mask the detection of the causal epistasis.",Unified Cox model based multifactor dimensionality reduction method for gene-gene interaction analysis of the survival phenotype.

"Increased oxidative stress and abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are positively correlated with a variety of pathophysiologies, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and neuroinflammation. In adipose biology, diabetic obesity is correlated with increased ROS in an age- and depot-specific manner and is mechanistically linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, potentiated lipolysis, and insulin resistance. The cellular quality control systems that homeostatically regulate oxidative stress in the lean state are down-regulated in obesity as a consequence of inflammatory cytokine pressure leading to the accumulation of oxidized biomolecules. New findings have linked protein, DNA, and lipid oxidation at the biochemical level, and the structures and potential functions of protein adducts such as carbonylation that accumulate in stressed cells have been characterized. The sum total of such regulation and biochemical changes results in alteration of cellular metabolism and function in the obese state relative to the lean state and underlies metabolic disease progression. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms and events underlying these processes and their implications for human health and disease.",Adipose oxidative stress and protein carbonylation.
"The primary objective of this study was to realize the large-scale discovery of conotoxin sequences from different organs (including the venom duct, venom bulb and salivary gland) of the vermivorous Oak cone snail, Conus quercinus. Using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we identified 133 putative conotoxins that belong to 34 known superfamilies, of which nine were previously reported while the remaining 124 were novel conotoxins, with 17 in new and unassigned conotoxin groups. A-, O(1)-, M-, and I(2)- superfamilies were the most abundant, and the cysteine frameworks XIII and VIII were observed for the first time in the A- and I(2)-superfamilies. The transcriptome data from the venom duct, venom bulb and salivary gland showed considerable inter-organizational variations. Each organ had many exclusive conotoxins, and only seven of all the inferred mature peptides were common in the three organs. As expected, most of the identified conotoxins were synthesized in the venom duct at relatively high levels; however, a number of conotoxins were also identified in the venom bulb and the salivary gland with very low transcription levels. Therefore, various organs have different conotoxins with high diversity, suggesting greater contributions from several organs to the high-throughput discovery of new conotoxins for future drug development.",High Throughput Identification of Novel Conotoxins from the Vermivorous Oak Cone Snail (Conus quercinus) by Transcriptome Sequencing.

"OBJECTIVES: Several single-tablet regimens (STRs) are now available and are recommended for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART); however, STR use for youth with HIV (YHIV) has not been systematically studied. We examined the characteristics associated with initiation of STRs versus multi-tablet regimens (MTRs) and the virological outcomes for youth with nonperinatally acquired HIV (nPHIV). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of nPHIV youth aged 13-24 years initiating ART between 2006 and 2014 at 18 US HIV clinical sites in the HIV Research Network was performed. The outcomes measured were initiation of STRs versus MTRs, virological suppression (VS) at 12 months, and time to VS. Demographic and clinical factors associated with initiation of STR versus MTR ART and VS (< 400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) at 12 months after initiation were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess VS within the first year. RESULTS: Of 987 youth, 67% initiated STRs. Of the 589 who had viral load data at 1 year, 84% of those on STRs versus 67% of those on MTRs achieved VS (P < 0.01). VS was associated with STR use [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-2.58], white (AOR 2.41; 95% CI 1.13-5.13) or Hispanic (AOR 2.38; 95% CI 1.32-4.27) race/ethnicity, and baseline CD4 count 351-500 cells/muL (AOR 1.94; 95% CI 1.18-3.19) and > 500 cells/muL (AOR 1.76; 95% CI 1.0-3.10). STR use was not associated with a shorter time to VS compared with MTR use [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07; 95% CI 0.90-1.28]. CONCLUSIONS: Use of STR was associated with a greater likelihood of sustained VS 12 months after ART initiation in YHIV.",Uptake and virological outcomes of single- versus multi-tablet antiretroviral regimens among treatment-naive youth in the HIV Research Network.

"INTRODUCTION: Totally implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) are the preferred devices for patients with advanced lung disease who require long-term venous access. The primary purpose of this study was to describe the natural history of TIVADs left in place at the time of transplant. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study evaluated pediatric and adult lung transplant recipients from 5/5/2005 to 12/31/17 with pretransplant TIVAD. Incident rates (IR) for infectious and mechanical complications were calculated. Poisson regression models were used to identify TIVAD characteristics associated with complications. RESULTS: Of 1253 transplant recipients, 82 (6.5%) had pretransplant TIVAD. Five (6.1%) TIVADs were removed at transplantation. Fifty-five (67.1%) TIVADs were eventually removed, most commonly because they were no longer required (50.9%) or because of infection (25.5%). Overall incident rates (IR) of infectious or mechanical complications were 0.33 and 0.14, respectively. The IR of infection was highest within one year of transplant, particularly during the index hospitalization (IR = 1.67). Youngest tertile (<22 years) had the lowest incident rate ratio of TIVAD infections (IRR = 0.22). CONCLUSION: Although TIVAD complication rates in lung transplant recipients are similar to non-transplant and other immunocompromised patients, TIVAD removal at transplant or within the first post-transplant year may minimize the risk of TIVAD infections.",Complications related to totally implantable venous access devices in children and adults following lung transplantation.
"Background Over 6000 children have an in-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States annually. Most will not survive to discharge, with significant variability in survival across hospitals suggesting improvement in resuscitation performance can save lives. Methods and Results A prospective observational study of quality of chest compressions ( CC ) during pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest associated with development and implementation of a resuscitation quality bundle. Objectives were to: 1) implement a debriefing program, 2) identify impediments to delivering high quality CC , 3) develop a resuscitation quality bundle, and 4) measure the impact of the resuscitation quality bundle on compliance with American Heart Association ( AHA ) Pediatric Advanced Life Support CC guidelines over time. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between compliance and year of event, adjusting for age and weight. Over 3 years, 317 consecutive cardiac arrests were debriefed, 38% (119/317) had CC data captured via defibrillator-based accelerometer pads, data capture increasing over time: (2013:13% [12/92] versus 2014:43% [44/102] versus 2015:51% [63/123], P<0.001). There were 2135 1-minute cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) epoch data available for analysis, (2013:152 versus 2014:922 versus 2015:1061, P<0.001). Performance mitigating themes were identified and evolved into the resuscitation quality bundle entitled CPR Coaching, Objective-Data Evaluation, Action-linked-phrases, Choreography, Ergonomics, Structured debriefing and Simulation (CODE ACES(2)). The adjusted marginal probability of a CC epoch meeting the criteria for excellent CPR (compliant for rate, depth, and chest compression fraction) in 2015, after CPR Coaching, Objective-Data Evaluation, Action-linked-phrases, Choreography, Ergonomics, Structured debriefing and Simulation was developed and implemented, was 44.3% (35.3-53.3) versus 19.9%(6.9-32.9) in 2013; (odds ratio 3.2 [95% confidence interval:1.3-8.1], P=0.01).

"BACKGROUND: Diagnostic criteria are used to identify a patient having a disease in a clinical setting, whereas classification criteria create a well-defined population for research purposes. The diagnosis and classification of amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM) have not been recognized by most existing criteria for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). To address this, several criteria were proposed to define ADM either as a distinct disease entity or as a subset of the spectrum of IIMs. OBJECTIVES: To discuss the diagnosis and classification of ADM and to assesses the available criteria in identifying cases of ADM and/or distinguishing it from dermatological mimickers such as lupus erythematosus. METHODS: We conducted an extensive literature search using the PubMed database from June 2016 to August 2018, using the search terms 'amyopathic dermatomyositis', 'diagnosis' and 'classification'. RESULTS: The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, which are the only validated classification criteria for adult and juvenile IIM and their major subgroups, include three cutaneous items (Gottron sign, Gottron papules, heliotrope rash) to be able to classify ADM. This international and multispecialty effort is a huge step forward in the classification of skin-predominant disease in dermatomyositis. However, about 25% of the population with ADM do not meet two out of the three skin features and are misdiagnosed or classified as having a different disease entity, most commonly lupus erythematosus. CONCLUSIONS: These gaps rationalize the continuous assessment and improvement of existing criteria and/or the development of validated, separate and skin-focused criteria for DM.",The diagnosis and classification of amyopathic dermatomyositis: a historical review and assessment of existing criteria.
"Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS), which encompasses interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, is characterized by chronic pain in the pelvic region or genitalia that is often accompanied by urinary frequency and urgency. Despite considerable research, no definite aetiological risk factors or effective treatments have been identified. The Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network uses a novel integrated strategy to characterize UCPPS as a systemic disorder that potentially involves multiple aetiologies. The first phase, MAPP I, included >1,000 participants who completed an intensive baseline assessment followed by a 12-month observational follow-up period. MAPP I studies showed that UCPPS pain and urinary symptoms co-vary, with only moderate correlation, and should be evaluated separately and that symptom flares are common and can differ considerably in intensity, duration and influence on quality of life. Longitudinal clinical changes in UCPPS correlated with structural and functional brain changes, and many patients experienced global multisensory hypersensitivity. Additionally, UCPPS symptom profiles were distinguishable by biological correlates, such as immune factors. These findings indicate that patients with UCPPS have objective phenotypic abnormalities and distinct biological characteristics, providing a new foundation for the study and clinical management of UCPPS.",Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome: insights from the MAPP Research Network.
"Slow-wave sleep is an optimal opportunity for memory consolidation: when encoding occurs in the presence of a sensory cue, delivery of that cue during sleep enhances retrieval of associated memories. Recent studies suggest that cues might promote consolidation by inducing neural reinstatement of cue-associated content during sleep, but direct evidence for such mechanisms is scant, and the relevant brain areas supporting these processes are poorly understood. Here, we address these gaps by combining a novel olfactory cueing paradigm with an object-location memory task and simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording in human subjects. Using pattern analysis of fMRI ensemble activity, we find that presentation of odor cues during sleep promotes reactivation of category-level information in ventromedial prefrontal cortex that significantly correlates with post-sleep memory performance. In identifying the potential mechanisms by which odor cues selectively modulate memory in the sleeping brain, these findings bring unique insights into elucidating how and what we remember.",Odor-evoked category reactivation in human ventromedial prefrontal cortex during sleep promotes memory consolidation.

"Citrate is a ubiquitous compound and can be utilized by many bacterial species, including enteric pathogens, as a carbon and energy source. Genes involved in citrate utilization have been extensively studied in some enteric bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae; however, their role in pathogenesis is still not clear. In this study, we investigated citrate utilization and regulation in Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera. The putative anaerobic citrate fermentation genes in V. cholerae, consisting of citCDEFXG, citS-oadGAB, and the two-component system (TCS) genes citAB, are highly homologous to those in K. pneumoniae Deletion analysis shows that these cit genes are essential for V. cholerae growth when citrate is the sole carbon source. The expression of citC and citS operons was dependent on citrate and CitAB, whose transcription was autorepressed and regulated by another TCS regulator, ArcA. In addition, citrate fermentation was under the control of catabolite repression. Mouse colonization experiments showed that V. cholerae can utilize citrate in vivo using the citrate fermentation pathway and that V. cholerae likely needs to compete with other members of the gut microbiota to access citrate in the gut.",CitAB Two-Component System-Regulated Citrate Utilization Contributes to Vibrio cholerae Competitiveness with the Gut Microbiota.

"OBJECTIVE: To use novel statistical methods for analyzing the effect of lesion set on (long-standing) persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network trial of surgical ablation during mitral valve surgery (MVS). METHODS: Two hundred sixty such patients were randomized to MVS + surgical ablation or MVS alone. Ablation was randomized between pulmonary vein isolation and biatrial maze. During 12 months postsurgery, 228 patients (88%) submitted 7949 transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) recordings, analyzed for AF, atrial flutter (AFL), or atrial tachycardia (AT). As previously reported, more ablation than MVS-alone patients were free of AF or AF/AFL at 6 and 12 months (63% vs 29%; P < .001) by 72-hour Holter monitoring, without evident difference between lesion sets (for which the trial was underpowered). RESULTS: Estimated freedom from AF/AFL/AT on any transmission trended higher after biatrial maze than pulmonary vein isolation (odds ratio, 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-5.65; P = .07) 3 to 12 months postsurgery; estimated AF/AFL/AT load (ie, proportion of TTM strips recording AF/AFL/AT) was similar (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-1.43; P = .6). Within 12 months, estimated prevalence of AF/AFL/AT by TTM was 58% after MVS alone, and 36% versus 23% after pulmonary vein isolation versus biatrial maze (P < .02). CONCLUSIONS: Statistical modeling using TTM recordings after MVS in patients with (long-standing) persistent AF suggests that a biatrial maze is associated with lower AF/AFL/AT prevalence, but not a lower load, compared with pulmonary vein isolation. The discrepancy between AF/AFL/AT prevalence assessed at 2 time points by Holter monitoring versus weekly TTM suggests the need for a confirmatory trial, reassessment of definitions for failure after ablation, and validation of statistical methods for assessing atrial rhythms longitudinally.",Biatrial maze procedure versus pulmonary vein isolation for atrial fibrillation during mitral valve surgery: New analytical approaches and end points.

"Importance: Measurement of delirium severity has been recognized as highly important for tracking prognosis, monitoring response to treatment, and estimating burden of care for patients both during and after hospitalization. Rather than simply rating delirium as present or absent, the ability to quantify its severity would enable development and monitoring of more effective treatment approaches for the condition. Objectives: To present a comprehensive review of delirium severity instruments, conduct a methodologic quality rating of the original validation study of the most commonly used instruments, and select a group of top-rated instruments. Evidence Review: This systematic review was conducted using literature from Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, from January 1, 1974, through March 31, 2017, with the key words delirium, severity, tests, measures, and intensity. Inclusion criteria were original articles assessing delirium severity and using a delirium-specific severity instrument. Final listings of articles were supplemented with hand searches of reference listings to ensure completeness. At least 2 reviewers independently completed each step of the review process: article selection, data extraction, and methodologic quality assessment of relevant articles using a validated rating scale. All discrepancies between raters were resolved by consensus. Findings: Of 9409 articles identified, 228 underwent full text review, and we identified 42 different instruments of delirium severity. Eleven of the 42 tools were multidomain, delirium-specific instruments providing a quantitative rating of delirium severity; these instruments underwent a methodologic quality review. Applying prespecified criteria related to frequency of use, methodologic quality, construct or predictive validity, and broad domain coverage, an expert panel used an iterative modified Delphi process to select 6 final high-quality instruments meeting these criteria: the Confusion Assessment Method-Severity Score, Confusional State Examination, Delirium-O-Meter, Delirium Observation Scale, Delirium Rating Scale, and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale. Conclusions and Relevance: The 6 instruments identified may enable accurate measurement of delirium severity to improve clinical care for patients with this condition. This work may stimulate increased usage and head-to-head comparison of these instruments.",Assessment of Instruments for Measurement of Delirium Severity: A Systematic Review.
"Objective: The objective of this study was to better understand the experience of coercive control as a type of IPV by examining associations between coercive control and women's experiences of particular forms of violence, use of violence, and risk of future violence. Method: As part of a larger research study, data were collected from 553 women patients at two hospital emergency departments who had experienced recent IPV and unhealthy drinking. Baseline assessments, including measures of coercive control, danger, and experience and use of psychological, physical, and sexual forms of IPV in the prior three months were analyzed. Results: Women experiencing coercive control reported higher frequency of each form of IPV, and higher levels of danger, compared to women IPV survivors who were not experiencing coercive control. There was no statistically significant association between experience of coercive control and women's use of psychological or sexual IPV; women who experienced coercive control were more likely to report using physical IPV than women who were not experiencing coercive control. Conclusions: Findings contribute to knowledge on the relationship between coercive control and specific forms of violence against intimate partners. A primary contribution is the identification that women who experience coercive control may also use violence, indicating that a woman's use of violence does not necessarily mean that she is not also experiencing severe and dangerous violence as well as coercive control. In fact, experience of coercive control may increase victims' use of physical violence as a survival strategy.","Coercive Control in Intimate Partner Violence: Relationship with Women's Experience of Violence, Use of Violence, and Danger."
"Transcriptional regulation occurs via changes to rates of different biochemical steps of transcription, but it remains unclear which rates are subject to change upon biological perturbation. Biochemical studies have suggested that stimuli predominantly affect the rates of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment and polymerase release from promoter-proximal pausing. Single-cell studies revealed that transcription occurs in discontinuous bursts, suggesting that features of such bursts like frequency and intensity could also be regulated. We combined Pol II chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and single-cell transcriptional measurements to show that an independently regulated burst initiation step is required before polymerase recruitment can occur. Using a number of global and targeted transcriptional regulatory perturbations, we showed that biological perturbations regulated both burst initiation and polymerase pause release rates but seemed not to regulate polymerase recruitment rate. Our results suggest that transcriptional regulation primarily acts by changing the rates of burst initiation and polymerase pause release.",Transcriptional Burst Initiation and Polymerase Pause Release Are Key Control Points of Transcriptional Regulation.
"Throughout history, physicians have traveled extensively to acquire new knowledge or to learn the latest therapeutic techniques from colleagues and academicians. This ""wanderlust"" persists in many who want to understand the world around them and learn from others, physicians or nonphysicians. Before the era of instantaneous online telecommunication, dermatologists would enhance their education by traveling abroad to learn from world-renowned experts in Europe and elsewhere and return with a treasure trove of knowledge and new skills. With the Internet, webinars, and teledermatology, the attraction for travel has diminished, mainly due to our ever-increasing demanding world of obligations; however, face-to-face interaction with colleagues of a different culture and educational background still has an inexorable educational value. To facilitate such endeavors, many insightful educators have taken the opportunity to establish several international societies and academies, where on-site educational activities can take place. Currently, a few of the more active and popular dermatologic organizations that are conducting meetings around the world are the International League of Dermatologic Societies; International Society of Dermatology; North American Clinical Dermatologic Society; International Society of Dermatologic Surgery; International Academy of Cosmetic Dermatology; and European Society of Cosmetic and Aesthetic Dermatology, all of which exemplify ""travel as a teaching tool.""",Travel as a teaching and learning tool.

"Current models of aggression suggest that in addition to personality traits and environmental factors, biological vulnerability associated with genetics substantially impacts aggressive behavior. In a functional imaging study, we investigated the influence of the single nucleotide polymorphism of the mu 1 subtype opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), implicated in sociability, on correlates of trait and state aggression to delineate the function of these influences in aggression. A key aim was further to differentiate different aspects of aggressive reactions - namely, the reaction to provocation and the decision to punish an opponent. 59 healthy males performed a modified Taylor Aggression Paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The implementation of the paradigm allowed for individual assessments of the decision to behave aggressively, the experience of provocation and the ramification of punishment for the participant or the opponent. The influence of variation in the OPRM1 gene was measured by the functional A118G polymorphism. G allele carriers showed lower levels of general aggression and self-reported physical aggression. Additionally, these participants exhibited increased activation in dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortices when choosing higher punishments for the opponent. The OPRM1 polymorphism did not influence aggression in reaction to social provocation. Thus, we suggest that this genetic variant affects one's trait aggressiveness rather than actual behavioral reactivity to provocation. Investigating brain regions that are specifically linked to provocation yielded activation in cortico-limbic circuits which might mediate the evaluation of provocation and the experience of anger and thus shed light on neural processes underlying the risk for aggressive behavior.",The influence of the OPRM1 (A118G) polymorphism on behavioral and neural correlates of aggression in healthy males.

"Drug abuse is a multifaceted disorder that involves maladaptive decision making. Long-lasting changes in the addicted brain are mediated by a complex circuit of brain reward regions. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is one region in which chronic drug exposure changes expression and function of upstream transcriptional regulators to alter drug responses and aspects of the addicted phenotype. We reported recently that the transcription factor E2F3a is a critical mediator of cocaine responses in the nucleus accumbens. E2F3a is one of two splice variants of the E2f3 gene; the other is E2F3b. Another recent study predicted E2F3 as an upstream regulator of the transcriptional response to cocaine self-administration (SA) in PFC. Based on previous findings that E2F3a and E2F3b have divergent regulatory roles, we set out to study the putative transcriptional role of these transcripts in PFC in the context of repeated I.P. cocaine exposure. We implemented viral-mediated isoform-specific gene manipulation, RNA-sequencing, advanced bioinformatics analyses, and animal behavior to determine how E2F3a and E2F3b contribute to persistent cocaine-induced transcriptional changes in PFC. We show that E2F3b, but not E2F3a, in PFC is critical for cocaine locomotor and place preference behaviors. Interestingly, RNA-seq of PFC following E2f3b overexpression or I.P. cocaine exposure showed very different effects on expression levels of differentially expressed genes. However, we found that E2F3b drives a similar transcriptomic pattern to that of cocaine SA with overlapping upstream regulators and downstream pathways predicted. These findings reveal a novel transcriptional mechanism in PFC that controls behavioral and molecular responses to cocaine.",A novel role for E2F3b in regulating cocaine action in the prefrontal cortex.
"The mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism in response to diverse stimuli. Two major parallel pathways are implicated in mTORC1 regulation including a growth factor-responsive pathway mediated via TSC2/Rheb and an amino acid-responsive pathway mediated via the Rag GTPases. Here, we identify and characterize three highly conserved growth factor-responsive phosphorylation sites on RagC, a component of the Rag heterodimer, implicating cross talk between amino acid and growth factor-mediated regulation of mTORC1. We find that RagC phosphorylation is associated with destabilization of mTORC1 and is essential for both growth factor and amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation. Functionally, RagC phosphorylation suppresses starvation-induced autophagy, and genetic studies in Drosophila reveal that RagC phosphorylation plays an essential role in regulation of cell growth. Finally, we identify mTORC1 as the upstream kinase of RagC on S21. Our data highlight the importance of RagC phosphorylation in its function and identify a previously unappreciated auto-regulatory mechanism of mTORC1 activity.",RagC phosphorylation autoregulates mTOR complex 1.

"Vaccines for prevention and treatment of genital herpes are high public health priorities. Our approach towards vaccine development is to focus on blocking virus entry mediated by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein D (gD2) and to prevent the virus from evading complement and antibody attack by blocking the immune evasion domains on HSV-2 glycoproteins C (gC2) and E (gE2), respectively. HSV-2 gC2 and gE2 are expressed on the virion envelope and infected cell surface where they are potential targets of antibodies that bind and block their immune evasion activities. We demonstrate that antibodies produced during natural infection in humans or intravaginal inoculation in guinea pigs bind to gC2 but generally fail to block the immune evasion domains on this glycoprotein. In contrast, immunization of naive or previously HSV-2-infected guinea pigs with gC2 subunit antigen administered with CpG and alum as adjuvants produces antibodies that block domains involved in immune evasion. These results indicate that immune evasion domains on gC2 are weak antigens during infection, yet when used as vaccine immunogens with adjuvants the antigens produce antibodies that block immune evasion domains.",A trivalent gC2/gD2/gE2 vaccine for herpes simplex virus generates antibody responses that block immune evasion domains on gC2 better than natural infection.

"Following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), many patients experience coma - an unresponsive state lacking wakefulness or awareness. Coma rarely lasts more than two weeks, and emergence involves passing through a state of wakefulness without awareness of self or environment. Patients that linger in these Disorders of Consciousness (DoC) undergo clinical assessments of awareness for diagnosis into Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (no awareness, also called vegetative state) or Minimally Conscious State (periodic increases in awareness). These diagnoses are notoriously inaccurate, offering little prognostic value. Recovery of awareness is unpredictable, returning within weeks, years, or never. This leaves patients' families with difficult decisions and little information on which to base them. Clinical studies have made significant advancements, but remain encumbered by high variability, limited data output, and a lack of necessary controls. Herein we discuss the clear and present need to establish a preclinical model of TBI-induced DoC, the significant challenges involved, and how such a model can be applied to support DoC research.",Challenges and demand for modeling disorders of consciousness following traumatic brain injury.

"BACKGROUND: Wrong blood in tube (WBIT) errors are a preventable cause of ABO-mismatched RBC transfusions. Electronic patient identification systems (e.g., scanning a patient's wristband barcode before pretransfusion sample collection) are thought to reduce WBIT errors, but the effectiveness of these systems is unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Part 1: Using retrospective data, we compared pretransfusion sample WBIT rates at hospitals using manual patient identification (n = 16 sites; >1.6 million samples) with WBIT rates at hospitals using electronic patient identification for some or all sample collections (n = 4 sites; >0.5 million samples). Also, we compared WBIT rates after implementation of electronic patient identification with preimplementation WBIT rates. Causes and frequencies of WBIT errors were evaluated at each site. Part 2: Transfusion service laboratories (n = 18) prospectively typed mislabeled (rejected) samples (n = 2844) to determine WBIT rates among samples with minor labeling errors. RESULTS: Part 1: The overall unadjusted WBIT rate at sites using manual patient identification was 1:10,110 versus 1:35,806 for sites using electronic identification (p < 0.0001). Correcting for repeat samples and silent WBIT errors yielded overall adjusted WBIT rates of 1:3046 for sites using manual identification and 1:14,606 for sites using electronic identification (p < 0.0001), with wide variation among individual sites. Part 2: The unadjusted WBIT rate among mislabeled (rejected) samples was 1:71 (adjusted WBIT rate, 1:28). CONCLUSION: In this study, using electronic patient identification at the time of pretransfusion sample collection was associated with approximately fivefold fewer WBIT errors compared with using manual patient identification. WBIT rates were high among mislabeled (rejected) samples, confirming that rejecting samples with even minor labeling errors helps mitigate the risk of ABO-incompatible transfusions.",Electronic patient identification for sample labeling reduces wrong blood in tube errors.

"Tau is an axonal microtubule-binding protein. Tau pathology in brain and increased tau concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most of tau in CSF is present as fragments. We immunoprecipitated tau from CSF and identified several endogenous peptides ending at amino acid (aa) 123 or 224 using high-resolution mass spectrometry. We raised neo-epitope-specific antibodies against tau fragments specifically ending at aa 123 and 224, respectively. With these antibodies, we performed immunohistochemistry on brain tissue and designed immunoassays measuring N-123, N-224, and x-224 tau. Immunoassays were applied to soluble brain fractions from pathologically confirmed subjects (81 AD patients, 33 controls), CSF from three cross-sectional and two longitudinal cohorts (a total of 133 AD, 38 MCI, 20 MCI-AD, 31 PSP, 15 CBS patients, and 91 controls), and neuronally- and peripherally-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs and PDEVs, respectively) in serum from four AD patients and four controls. Anti-tau 224 antibody stained neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, while anti-tau 123 only showed weak cytoplasmic staining in AD. N-224 tau was lower in the AD soluble brain fraction compared to controls, while N-123 tau showed similar levels. N-224 tau was higher in AD compared to controls in all CSF cohorts (p < 0.001), but not N-123 tau. Decrease in cognitive performance and conversion from MCI to AD were associated with increased baseline CSF levels of N-224 tau (p < 0.0001). N-224 tau concentrations in PSP and CBS were significantly lower than in AD (p < 0.0001) and did not correlate to t-tau and p-tau. In a longitudinal cohort, CSF N-224 tau levels were stable over 6 months, with no significant effect of treatment with AChE inhibitors. N-224 tau was present in NDEVs, while N-123 tau showed comparable concentrations in both vesicle types. We suggest that N-123 tau is produced both in CNS and PNS and represents a general marker of tau metabolism, while N-224 tau is neuron-specific, present in the tangles, secreted in CSF, and upregulated in AD, suggesting a link between tau cleavage and propagation, tangle pathology, and cognitive decline.",Novel tau fragments in cerebrospinal fluid: relation to tangle pathology and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.
"The function of the right ventricle determines the fate of patients with pulmonary hypertension. Since right heart failure is the consequence of increased afterload, a full physiological description of the cardiopulmonary unit consisting of both the right ventricle and pulmonary vascular system is required to interpret clinical data correctly.

"This study examined the psychometric properties of the Self-Appraisal of Change Scale, a measure designed to capture domains that are subjectively relevant to caregivers, associated with overall well-being, and amenable to change upon engaging in an intervention. Data from 107 caregivers of veterans with dementia enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a telephone-delivered caregiver psychoeducation and support group program (the Telehealth Education Program (TEP)) were analyzed. The TEP, which was delivered by master's prepared social workers and a nurse dementia care manager, targeted caregivers' dementia-related knowledge, attitudes, and self-management skills. Analyses were conducted to determine the factor structure, reliability, validity, and measurement invariance of the scale. Factor analyses yielded a single-factor solution for the scale's nine items. The reliability and construct validity of the scale were also supported by the analyses. Multi-group analyses suggested that meaningful comparisons of scale items and total raw scores can be made across usual care (UC) and intervention groups. The findings offer preliminary support that the scale may represent a valid and reliable instrument that captures perceived changes in key domains (e.g. caregiving knowledge, attitudes, and skill) following participation in a psychoeducational and support intervention trial.",Measuring Self-Appraised Changes following Participation in an Intervention for Caregivers of Individuals with Dementia.
"Neuroaesthetics is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field of research that aims to understand the neural substrates of aesthetic experience: While understanding aesthetic experience has been an objective of philosophers for centuries, it has only more recently been embraced by neuroscientists. Recent work in neuroaesthetics has revealed that aesthetic experience with static visual art engages visual, reward and default-mode networks. Very little is known about the temporal dynamics of these networks during aesthetic appreciation. Previous behavioral and brain imaging research suggests that critical aspects of aesthetic experience have slow dynamics, taking more than a few seconds, making them amenable to study with fMRI. Here, we identified key aspects of the dynamics of aesthetic experience while viewing art for various durations. In the first few seconds following image onset, activity in the DMN (and high-level visual and reward regions) was greater for very pleasing images; in the DMN this activity counteracted a suppressive effect that grew longer and deeper with increasing image duration. In addition, for very pleasing art, the DMN response returned to baseline in a manner time-locked to image offset. Conversely, for non-pleasing art, the timing of this return to baseline was inconsistent. This differential response in the DMN may therefore reflect the internal dynamics of the participant's state: The participant disengages from art-related processing and returns to stimulus-independent thought. These dynamics suggest that the DMN tracks the internal state of a participant during aesthetic experience.",Dynamics of aesthetic experience are reflected in the default-mode network.

"Abnormalities in the X-linked FMR1 gene are associated with a constellation of disorders, which have broad and profound implications for the person first diagnosed, and extended family members of all ages. The rare and pleiotropic nature of the associated disorders, both common and not, place great burdens on (1) the affected families, (2) their care providers and clinicians, and (3) investigators striving to conduct research on the conditions. Fragile X syndrome, occurring more severely in males, is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability. Fragile X associated tremor and ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder seen more often in older men. Fragile X associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is a chronic disorder characterized by oligo/amenorrhea and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism before age 40 years. There may be significant morbidity due to: (1) depression and anxiety related to the loss of reproductive hormones and infertility; (2) reduced bone mineral density; and (3) increased risk of cardiovascular disease related to estrogen deficiency. Here we report the case of a young woman who never established regular menses and yet experienced a 5-year diagnostic odyssey before establishing a diagnosis of FXPOI despite a known family history of fragile X syndrome and early menopause. Also, despite having clearly documented FXPOI the woman conceived spontaneously and delivered two healthy children. We review the pathophysiology and management of FXPOI. As a rare disease, the diagnosis of FXPOI presents special challenges. Connecting patients and community health providers with investigators who have the requisite knowledge and expertise about the FMR1 gene and FXPOI would facilitate both patient care and research. There is a need for an international natural history study on FXPOI. The effort should be coordinated by a global virtual center, which takes full advantage of mobile device communication systems.",Fragile X Associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI): Case Report and Literature Review.

"While well-represented on clinical measures, co-speech gesture production has never been formally studied in autistic adults. Twenty-one verbally fluent autistic adults and 21 typically developing controls engaged in a controlled conversational task. Group differences were observed in both semantic/pragmatic and motoric features of spontaneously produced co-speech gestures. Autistic adults prioritized different functions of co-speech gesture. Specifically, they used gesture more than controls to facilitate conversational turn-taking, demonstrating a novel nonverbal strategy for regulating conversational dynamics. Autistic adults were more likely to gesture unilaterally than bilaterally, a motoric feature of gesture that was individually associated with autism symptoms. Co-speech gestures may provide a link between nonverbal communication symptoms and known differences in motor performance in autism.",Atypicalities of Gesture Form and Function in Autistic Adults.
"We recently reported that in rodent models of type 2 diabetes (T2D), a single intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) induces remission of hyperglycemia that is sustained for weeks. To clarify the peripheral mechanisms underlying this effect, we used the Zucker diabetic fatty fa/fa rat model of T2D, which, like human T2D, is characterized by progressive deterioration of pancreatic beta-cell function after hyperglycemia onset. We report that although icv FGF1 injection delays the onset of beta-cell dysfunction in these animals, it has no effect on either glucose-induced insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity. These observations suggest that FGF1 acts in the brain to stimulate insulin-independent glucose clearance. On the basis of our finding that icv FGF1 treatment increases hepatic glucokinase gene expression, we considered the possibility that increased hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) contributes to the insulin-independent glucose-lowering effect of icv FGF1. Consistent with this possibility, we report that icv FGF1 injection increases liver glucokinase activity by approximately twofold. We conclude that sustained remission of hyperglycemia induced by the central action of FGF1 involves both preservation of beta-cell function and stimulation of HGU through increased hepatic glucokinase activity.",Peripheral Mechanisms Mediating the Sustained Antidiabetic Action of FGF1 in the Brain.

As such, understanding of the determinants of mAb pharmacokinetic (PK) processes (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) is crucial in developing safe and efficacious therapeutics. In the present review, we discuss the use of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models as an approach to characterize the in vivo behavior of mAbs, in the context of the key PK processes that should be considered in these models. Additionally, we discuss current and potential future applications of PBPK in the drug discovery and development timeline for mAbs, spanning from identification of potential target molecules to prediction of potential drug-drug interactions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of currently available PBPK models for mAbs that could be implemented in the drug development process.",Physiologically-based modeling of monoclonal antibody pharmacokinetics in drug discovery and development.
"Importance: Biologic systems involved in the regulation of motor activity are intricately linked with other homeostatic systems such as sleep, feeding behavior, energy, and mood. Mobile monitoring technology (eg, actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment devices) allows the assessment of these multiple systems in real time. However, most clinical studies of mental disorders that use mobile devices have not focused on the dynamic associations between these systems. Objectives: To examine the directional associations among motor activity, energy, mood, and sleep using mobile monitoring in a community-identified sample, and to evaluate whether these within-day associations differ between people with a history of bipolar or other mood disorders and controls without mood disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used a nested case-control design of 242 adults, a subsample of a community-based sample of adults. Probands were recruited by mail from the greater Washington, DC, metropolitan area from January 2005 to June 2013. Enrichment of the sample for mood disorders was provided by volunteers or referrals from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center or by participants in the National Institute of Mental Health Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. The inclusion criteria were the ability to speak English, availability to participate, and consent to contact at least 2 living first-degree relatives. Data analysis was performed from June 2013 through July 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Motor activity and sleep duration data were obtained from minute-to-minute activity counts from an actigraphy device worn on the nondominant wrist for 2 weeks. Mood and energy levels were assessed by subjective analogue ratings on the ecological momentary assessment (using a personal digital assistant) by participants 4 times per day for 2 weeks. Results: Of the total 242 participants, 92 (38.1%) were men and 150 (61.9%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 48 (16.9) years. Among the participants, 54 (22.3%) had bipolar disorder (25 with bipolar I; 29 with bipolar II), 91 (37.6%) had major depressive disorder, and 97 (40.1%) were controls with no history of mood disorders. A unidirectional association was found between motor activity and subjective mood level (beta = -0.018, P = .04). Bidirectional associations were observed between motor activity (beta = 0.176; P = .03) and subjective energy level (beta = 0.027; P = .03) as well as between motor activity (beta = -0.027; P = .04) and sleep duration (beta = -0.154; P = .04). Greater cross-domain reactivity was observed in bipolar disorder across all outcomes, including motor activity, sleep, mood, and energy. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that interventions focused on motor activity and energy may have greater efficacy than current approaches that target depressed mood; both active and passive tracking of multiple regulatory systems are important in designing therapeutic targets.","Real-time Mobile Monitoring of the Dynamic Associations Among Motor Activity, Energy, Mood, and Sleep in Adults With Bipolar Disorder."
"The influenza virulence factor NS1 protein interacts with the cellular NS1-BP protein to promote splicing and nuclear export of the viral M mRNAs. The viral M1 mRNA encodes the M1 matrix protein and is alternatively spliced into the M2 mRNA, which is translated into the M2 ion channel. These proteins have key functions in viral trafficking and budding. To uncover the NS1-BP structural and functional activities in splicing and nuclear export, we performed proteomics analysis of nuclear NS1-BP binding partners and showed its interaction with constituents of the splicing and mRNA export machineries. NS1-BP BTB domains form dimers in the crystal. Full-length NS1-BP is a dimer in solution and forms at least a dimer in cells. Mutations suggest that dimerization is important for splicing. The central BACK domain of NS1-BP interacts directly with splicing factors such as hnRNP K and PTBP1 and with the viral NS1 protein. The BACK domain is also the site for interactions with mRNA export factor Aly/REF and is required for viral M mRNA nuclear export. The crystal structure of the C-terminal Kelch domain shows that it forms a beta-propeller fold, which is required for the splicing function of NS1-BP. This domain interacts with the polymerase II C-terminal domain and SART1, which are involved in recruitment of splicing factors and spliceosome assembly, respectively. NS1-BP functions are not only critical for processing a subset of viral mRNAs but also impact levels and nuclear export of a subset of cellular mRNAs encoding factors involved in metastasis and immunity.",Structural-functional interactions of NS1-BP protein with the splicing and mRNA export machineries for viral and host gene expression.
"T cell entry into inflamed tissue involves firm adhesion, spreading, and migration of the T cells across endothelial barriers. These events depend on ""outside-in"" signals through which engaged integrins direct cytoskeletal reorganization. We investigated the molecular events that mediate this process and found that T cells from mice lacking expression of the adaptor protein Crk exhibited defects in phenotypes induced by the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), namely, actin polymerization, leading edge formation, and two-dimensional cell migration. Crk protein was an essential mediator of LFA-1 signaling-induced phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and its subsequent interaction with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit p85, thus promoting PI3K activity and cytoskeletal remodeling. In addition, we found that Crk proteins were required for T cells to respond to changes in substrate stiffness, as measured by alterations in cell spreading and differential phosphorylation of the force-sensitive protein CasL. These findings identify Crk proteins as key intermediates coupling LFA-1 signals to actin remodeling and provide mechanistic insights into how T cells sense and respond to substrate stiffness.",Crk adaptor proteins mediate actin-dependent T cell migration and mechanosensing induced by the integrin LFA-1.

"BACKGROUND: This study characterizes the perioperative morbidity of a large cohort of subjects with syndromic craniosynostosis who underwent transcranial or subcranial midface distraction. METHODS: Demographic and perioperative data were compared between those who underwent transcranial or subcranial midface distraction osteogenesis between July of 1999 and December of 2017. Univariate analysis was conducted using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Multivariate analysis was conducted using logistic regression modeling. Complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: Sixty-four subjects underwent a total of 71 midface distraction procedures. There was a total of 28 complications (39 percent). The trans cranial cohort had a significantly higher frequency of complications (58 percent) compared with the subcranial cohort (29 percent; p = 0.017), with a significantly greater proportion of infection-related complications in the transcranial cohort (80 percent versus 54 percent; p = 0.028). Transcranial complications included cranial contamination, whereas most subcranial cohort infections were superficial or limited facial abscesses. The only significant predictor variable for complications in a multivariate analysis was whether the osteotomy approach was transcranial as opposed to subcranial, with an odds ratio of 5.80 (p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Complication rates in midface distraction remain high, with transcranial procedures having significantly higher complication rates, infection-related complications, and notably greater severity of complications. Although the goals of surgery often dictate choice of osteotomy, the risks associated with transcranial procedures must be thoroughly understood by surgeon and patient alike.

"OBJECTIVE: To document the terminology patients hear during the treatment course for a nonviable pregnancy and to ask patients their perceived clarity and preference of terminology to identify a patient-centered lexicon. METHODS: We performed a preplanned substudy survey of English-speaking participants in New York, Pennsylvania, and California at the time of enrollment in a randomized multisite trial of medical management of first-trimester early pregnancy loss. The six-item survey, administered on paper or an electronic tablet, was developed and piloted for internal and external validity. We used a visual analog scale and quantified tests of associations between participant characteristics and survey responses using risk ratios. RESULTS: We approached 155 English-speaking participants in the parent study, of whom 145 (93.5%) participated. In the process of receiving their diagnosis from a clinician, participants reported hearing the terms ""miscarriage"" (n=109 [75.2%]) and ""early pregnancy loss"" (n=73 [50.3%]) more than ""early pregnancy failure"" (n=31 [21.3%]) and ""spontaneous abortion"" (n=21 [14.4%]). The majority selected ""miscarriage"" (n=79 [54.5%]) followed by ""early pregnancy loss"" (n=49 [33.8%]) as their preferred term. In multivariable models controlling for study site, ethnicity, race, history of induced abortion, and whether the current pregnancy was planned, women indicated that ""spontaneous abortion"" and ""early pregnancy failure"" were significantly less clear than ""early pregnancy loss"" (53/145, adjusted risk ratio 0.12, 95% CI 0.07-0.19 and 92/145, adjusted risk ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.24-0.61, respectively, as compared with 118/145 for ""early pregnancy loss""). ""Miscarriage"" scored similarly to ""early pregnancy loss"" in clarity (119/145, adjusted risk ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.62-1.77). CONCLUSION: The terminology used to communicate ""nonviable pregnancy in the first trimester"" is highly variable. In this cohort of women, most preferred the term ""miscarriage"" and classified both ""miscarriage"" and ""early pregnancy loss"" as clear labels for a nonviable pregnancy. Health care providers can use these terms to enhance patient-clinician communication.

"Youth athletics can provide numerous benefits to children. Until recently, athletics have been relatively free from scrutiny over the ways they put participants at risk. While it was often disregarded in early childhood research, athletics emerged as an avenue of child abuse in the 1980s. Individual cases reporting maltreatment of children participating in sports certainly existed, but these were felt to be single instances, not sentinel events. By the 1990s a small body of research had been established showing a pattern of abuse, spurring sporting organizations and governing bodies to assess their own policies and produce rough standards for safeguarding children against abuse. While multiple strides have been taken, there still exist gaps in knowledge surrounding abuse of child and adolescent athletes. This article reviews the scope and prevalence of abuse in youth athletics, definitions and what ultimately constitutes ""abuse,"" the unique aspects of abuse in sport, and recognition and preventative efforts.",Safeguarding the Child and Adolescent Athlete.
"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about whether sleep space impacts toddler sleep outcomes. We examined the prevalence of crib-sleeping and its association with caregiver-reported sleep patterns and problems in a large sample of toddlers from Western countries. METHODS: Participants were caregivers of 1983 toddlers ages 18.0-35.9 months (51.7% male; mean age 25.3 months) from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States sleeping in a crib or bed in a separate room from caregivers. Caregiver-reported sleep patterns and problems were collected via a free, publicly available child sleep smartphone application. RESULTS: Across countries/regions, rates of crib-sleeping decreased linearly with age, with 63.4% of toddlers ages 18.0-23.9 months, 34.3% of toddlers ages 24.0-29.9 months, and 12.6% of toddlers ages 30.0-35.9 months sleeping in a crib. Across age groups and countries, crib sleeping was significantly associated with an earlier bedtime, shorter sleep onset latency, fewer night awakenings, longer stretches of time asleep, increased nighttime sleep duration, and decreased bedtime resistance and sleep problems. The duration of night awakenings did not significantly differ by sleep space. CONCLUSION: Sleeping in a crib instead of a bed is associated with enhanced caregiver-reported sleep quantity and quality for toddlers in Western countries. Consistent with practice recommendations, deferring the crib-to-bed transition until age 3 years may benefit toddlers' sleep in Western contexts. Additional research is needed to identify the impact of sleep space on child sleep in other countries/regions.",Caregiver-perceived sleep outcomes in toddlers sleeping in cribs versus beds.
"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the timing of a delayed rise in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in preterm infants with congenital hypothyroidism, and to determine whether cases of congenital hypothyroidism would be missed by using current consensus guidelines of repeat screening at approximately 2 weeks of age or 2 weeks after the first screening. STUDY DESIGN: The study was performed over a 13-year period (January 2004-December 2016). Whole-blood TSH samples were collected between 72 and 120 hours after birth. Repeat samples were collected weekly in preterm infants until the infant was term-corrected (37 weeks' gestation). Patients were followed up to determine whether congenital hypothyroidism was permanent or transient. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (50.9%) preterm infants born at <33 weeks of gestation who were diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism had delayed TSH elevation and would not have been detected on first newborn screen. Twelve of these infants (40.7%) with delayed TSH elevation had decompensated hypothyroidism at diagnosis (free thyroxine [FT4] <10 pmol/L), and 4 had severe congenital hypothyroidism (FT4 <5.5 pmol/L) at diagnosis. If screening had been repeated only at 2 weeks of life, 13 infants (48%) with delayed TSH elevation would not have been identified. Of the 27 infants with delayed TSH elevation, 6 (22%) have permanent congenital hypothyroidism, and another 12 will be reevaluated at age 3 years. CONCLUSION: Repeat screening for congenital hypothyroidism in preterm infants is necessary to avoid missing cases of congenital hypothyroidism with delayed TSH elevation. Repeat screening once at 2 weeks of life will miss infants with delayed TSH elevation and decompensated permanent congenital hypothyroidism.",Optimal Timing of Repeat Newborn Screening for Congenital Hypothyroidism in Preterm Infants to Detect Delayed Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Elevation.
"OBJECTIVE: The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) is nestled between the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This neuroanatomical position is consistent with a potential role of this nucleus to regulate ingestive and motivated behavior. Here neuroanatomical, molecular, and behavior approaches are utilized to determine whether SuM contributes to ingestive and food-motivated behavior control. METHODS: Through the application of anterograde and retrograde neural tract tracing with novel designer viral vectors, the current findings show that SuM neurons densely innervate the LH in a sex dimorphic fashion. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a clinically targeted neuro-intestinal hormone with a well-established role in regulating energy balance and reward behaviors. Here we determine that GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) are expressed throughout the SuM of both sexes, and also directly on SuM LH-projecting neurons and investigate the role of SuM GLP-1R in the regulation of ingestive and motivated behavior in male and female rats. RESULTS: SuM microinjections of the GLP-1 analogue, exendin-4, reduced ad libitum intake of chow, fat, or sugar solution in both male and female rats, while food-motivated behaviors, measured using the sucrose motivated operant conditioning test, was only reduced in male rats. These data contrasted with the results obtained from a neighboring structure well known for its role in motivation and reward, the VTA, where females displayed a more potent response to GLP-1R activation by exendin-4. In order to determine the physiological role of SuM GLP-1R signaling regulation of energy balance, we utilized an adeno-associated viral vector to site-specifically deliver shRNA for the GLP-1R to the SuM. Surprisingly, and in contrast to previous results for the two SuM neighboring sites, LH and VTA, SuM GLP-1R knockdown increased food seeking and adiposity in obese male rats without altering food intake, body weight or food motivation in lean or obese, female or male rats. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results indicate that SuM potently contributes to ingestive and motivated behavior control; an effect contingent on sex, diet/homeostatic energy balance state and behavior of interest. These data also extend the map of brain sites directly responsive to GLP-1 agonists, and highlight key differences in the role that GLP-1R play in interconnected and neighboring nuclei.",GLP-1 modulates the supramammillary nucleus-lateral hypothalamic neurocircuit to control ingestive and motivated behavior in a sex divergent manner.

"Although it was long assumed that eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are almost always spliced to generate linear mRNAs, it is now clear that thousands of protein-coding genes can be non-canonically spliced using backsplicing to produce circular RNAs (circRNAs). Most mature circRNAs accumulate in the cytoplasm; however, little is known about how circRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as they lack many of the common signals used for mRNA export. In this point-of-view article, we will discuss our recently identified circRNA nuclear export pathway and address important open questions in the field.",The nuclear export of circular RNAs is primarily defined by their length.
"Pregnant women with epilepsy (PWWE) require continuous anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment to avoid risk to themselves and fetal risks secondary to maternal seizures, resulting in prolonged AED exposure to the developing embryo and fetus. The objectives of this study were to determine whether high-resolution metabolomics is able to link the metabolite profile of PWWE receiving lamotrigine or levetiracetam for seizure control to associated pharmacodynamic (PD) biological responses. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of plasma obtained from 82 PWWE was completed using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Biological alterations due to lamotrigine or levetiracetam monotherapy were determined by a metabolome-wide association study that compared patients taking either drug to those who did not require AED treatment. Metabolic changes associated with AED use were then evaluated by testing for drug-dose associated metabolic variations and pathway enrichment. AED therapy resulted in drug-associated metabolic profiles recognizable within maternal plasma. Both the parent compounds and major metabolites were detected, and each AED was correlated with other metabolic features and pathways. Changes in metabolites and metabolic pathways important to maternal health and linked to fetal neurodevelopment were detected for both drugs, including changes in onecarbon metabolism, neurotransmitter biosynthesis and steroid metabolism. In addition, decreased levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate were detected in women taking lamotrigine, which is consistent with recent findings showing increased risk of autism spectrum disorder traits in PWWE using AED. These results represent a first step in development of pharmacometabolomic framework with potential to detect adverse AED-related metabolic changes during pregnancy.",Metabolome-wide association study of anti-epileptic drug treatment during pregnancy.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To introduce emerging concepts in tissue resident CD8 T cell immunosurveillance and their relevance to control HIV infection. RECENT FINDINGS: It is well appreciated that HIV preferentially infects and persists in CD4 T cells located in gut and in lymphoid tissue, yet the majority of known immunological correlates of HIV control are derived from peripheral blood. Instead, tissue-based immunological surveillance likely dictates the course of infection. Recent studies have established that nonrecirculating resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells can be found in virtually every human tissue. These cells bear a transcriptional profile of tissue retention and immediate effector function, suggesting a pivotal role in protective immunity. Resident memory CD8 T cells specific for HIV have been found in higher numbers in sites of HIV persistence (gut and lymph nodes), and are inversely associated with HIV viral titers. These findings, along with previous studies on tissue-derived cells now known to include resident memory cells, shed new light on the compartmentalization of the immune response against HIV and its correlates of protection. SUMMARY: Resident memory CD8 T cells represent a critical unexplored component of immune surveillance in the setting of HIV infection. Understanding the induction, dynamics, and functional properties of HIV-specific resident memory T cells in relevant tissues will better inform efforts in the treatment, control, and potential cure of HIV infection.",Everything in its right place: resident memory CD8+ T cell immunosurveillance of HIV infection.
"Intestinal epithelial cells are among the most rapidly proliferating cell types in the human body. There are several different subtypes of epithelial cells, each with unique functional roles in responding to the ever-changing environment. The epithelium's ability for rapid and customized responses to environmental changes requires multitiered levels of gene regulation. An emerging paradigm in gastrointestinal epithelial cells is the regulation of functionally related mRNA families, or regulons, via RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). RBPs represent a rapid and efficient mechanism to regulate gene expression and cell function. In this review, we will provide an overview of intestinal epithelial RBPs and how they contribute specifically to intestinal epithelial stem cell dynamics. In addition, we will highlight key gaps in knowledge in the global understanding of RBPs in gastrointestinal physiology as an opportunity for future studies.",RNA regulons are essential in intestinal homeostasis.
"OBJECTIVES: To describe the findings, resulting changes in management, and safety profile of flexible bronchoscopy in the neonates with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective case series of twenty-seven neonates with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia who underwent flexible bronchoscopy in the neonatal intensive care unit. RESULTS: Flexible bronchoscopy revealed airway pathology in 20/27 (74%) patients. Tracheomalacia 13/27 (48%), bronchomalacia 11/27 (40.7%), and airway edema 13/27 (48%) were the most common findings. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 17 patients. BAL culture revealed a microorganism in 12/17 (70.5%) cases. Findings from bronchoscopy resulted in change in clinical management in 17/27 (63%) patients. Common interventions included initiation of antibiotics (37%) and treatment of tracheobronchomalacia with bethanechol (22.2%), atrovent (18.5%), and PEEP titration (18.5%).

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in men. Hypogonadism and testicular degeneration are almost universal. Truncal adiposity, metabolic syndrome and low bone mass occur frequently. This review summarizes the most recent advances in the pathogenesis and management of the endocrine abnormalities in Klinefelter syndrome. It is expected that optimal endocrine management will improve outcomes and quality of life in Klinefelter syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: In Klinefelter syndrome, testosterone replacement is routinely prescribed despite lack of evidence on the optimal dose and time for initiation of therapy. Cross-sectional studies have linked hypogonadism to the development of metabolic abnormalities and low bone mass. Testosterone therapy, however, is not consistently associated with improved metabolic and bone outcomes. Increased truncal adiposity and high rates of metabolic syndrome are present in prepubertal children. A randomized trial of oxandrolone in prepubertal boys showed improvement in visual-motor function, socialization and cardiometabolic health. Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) has success rates similar to other causes of nonobstructive azoospermia when performed between 16 and 35 years of age. SUMMARY: Endocrine care in Klinefelter syndrome should start in childhood and include evaluation of metabolic risk factors and bone health. Further research to guide evidence-based endocrine care is very much needed.",Endocrine aspects of Klinefelter syndrome.

We present two cases with Wolfram syndrome and evidence of retinal degeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational case series. Patients underwent complete ocular examinations as well as retinal imaging and electroretinography. RESULTS: Both patients had electroretinographic evidence of retinal dysfunction/degeneration in addition to optic atrophy with an otherwise normal-appearing retina. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with Wolfram syndrome have a mild retinal degeneration that may be a manifestation of the neuronal involvement that is present in this condition.",Evidence of retinal degeneration in Wolfram syndrome.
"BACKGROUND: This randomized phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of cinacalcet in children with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) receiving dialysis. METHODS: This study had double-blind and open-label phases. Eligible patients aged 6-< 18 years were randomized to cinacalcet (starting dose </= 0.20 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary endpoint was >/= 30% reduction from baseline in mean intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Secondary endpoints included mean iPTH </= 300 pg/mL; percentage change from baseline in corrected total serum calcium, phosphorus, and calcium phosphorus product (Ca x P); and safety. RESULTS: The double-blind phase comprised 43 patients (cinacalcet, n = 22; placebo, n = 21). Nineteen months into the study, regulatory authorities were notified of a fatality; the study was subsequently terminated after a 14-month clinical hold. Before the hold, 12 patients (55%) on cinacalcet and four (19%) on placebo achieved the primary endpoint (p = 0.017), and 27% and 24%, respectively, achieved iPTH </= 300 pg/mL. The between-group differences (95% CI) in percentage changes for total serum calcium, phosphorus, and Ca x P were - 4% (- 9 to 1%), - 6% (- 21 to 8%), and - 10% (- 23 to 3%). The mean maximum actual weight-adjusted daily cinacalcet dosage administered was 0.99 mg/kg/day. Overall, 82% of patients on cinacalcet and 86% on placebo had >/= 1 treatment-emergent adverse event; the most common were vomiting (32%, 24%, respectively), hypocalcemia (23%, 19%), nausea (18%, 14%), and hypertension (14%, 24%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite early termination, efficacy and safety outcomes observed with cinacalcet in children with SHPT on dialysis were consistent with adult observations, suggesting cinacalcet may meet an unmet medical need for this population.","A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of cinacalcet in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism receiving dialysis."
"Background: Prior reports have demonstrated inferior outcomes for patients with right-sided colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to patients with left-sided disease, as well as differences in treatment response based on disease sidedness. Differences in prognosis remain even among patients with metastatic disease, indicating that anatomy or stage at diagnosis alone cannot explain all of these findings. While genetic differences between right- and left-sided CRC have long been described, the genetic and molecular drivers underlying differences in prognosis and treatment response remain incompletely understood. Methods: We compared mutation prevalence between right- (cecum to splenic flexure) and left-sided (descending colon to rectum) CRC among 38 genes in a retrospective review of next-generation sequencing data of CRC samples obtained in routine clinical practice at a single academic medical center. Results: Among 288 cases (167 left-sided, 103 right-sided, 18 synchronous or without clear primary), patients with left-sided primaries had a longer overall survival from pathologic diagnosis (median 1,823 days vs. 1,006 days for right-sided cases, P=0.004). Among the assessed genes, BRAF and CTNNB1 mutations were more prevalent in right-sided CRC. BRAF was mutated in 15.5% of right-sided CRC (95% CI: 8.5-22.5%) compared to 4.8% (95% CI: 1.6-8.0%) (P=0.003). CTNNB1 was mutated in 3.9% of right-sided CRC (95% CI: 0.2-7.6%) compared to no instances of CTNNB1 mutations in left-sided disease (P=0.01). Conclusions: This difference in mutation prevalence may implicate these genetic pathways in the mechanisms underlying the discrepant outcomes and treatment responses between right- and left-sided CRC described in this and prior studies.",Differences in overall survival and mutation prevalence between right- and left-sided colorectal adenocarcinoma.

"Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is an immune-mediated bone marrow aplasia that is strongly associated with clonal hematopoiesis upon marrow recovery. More than 70% of AA patients develop somatic mutations in their hematopoietic cells. In contrast to other conditions linked to clonal hematopoiesis, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in the elderly, the top alterations in AA are closely related to its immune pathogenesis. Nearly 40% of AA patients carry somatic mutations in the PIGA gene manifested as clonal populations of cells with the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria phenotype, and 17% of AA patients have loss of HLA class I alleles. It is estimated that between 20% and 35% of AA patients have somatic mutations associated with hematologic malignancies, most characteristically in the ASXL1, BCOR, and BCORL1 genes. Risk factors for evolution to MDS in AA include the duration of disease, acquisition of high-risk somatic mutations, and age at AA onset. Emerging data suggest that several HLA class I alleles not only predispose to the development of AA but may also predispose to clonal evolution in AA patients. Long-term prospective studies are needed to determine the true prognostic implications of clonal hematopoiesis in AA. This article provides a brief, but comprehensive, review of our current understanding of clonal evolution in AA and concludes with 3 cases that illustrate a practical approach for integrating results of next-generation molecular studies into the clinical care of AA patients in 2018.","A brief, but comprehensive, guide to clonal evolution in aplastic anemia."

"Violent traumatic injury remains a common condition treated by emergency physicians. The medical management of these patients is well described and remains an area of focus for providers. However, violently injured patients disproportionately carry a history of physical and psychological trauma that frequently affects clinical care in the emergency department. The alteration of our clinical approach, taking into consideration how a patient's previous experiences influence how he or she may perceive and react to medical care, is a concept referred to as trauma-informed care. This approach is based on 4 pillars: knowledge of the effect of trauma, recognition of the signs and symptoms of trauma, avoidance of retraumatization, and the development of appropriate policies and procedures. Using this framework, we provide practical considerations for emergency physicians in the delivery of trauma-informed care for violently injured patients.",Trauma-Informed Care for Violently Injured Patients in the Emergency Department.

In our review, we extracted demographics, symptoms, historical data, imaging, and laboratory results; we compared with the general population. Eighty-seven percent had normal hearing. Age distribution, noise exposure, and frequency of psychiatric diagnoses in our cohort were consistent with previous reports. We found a lower incidence of otitis media and the same prevalence of dizziness, asthma, and hearing loss as the general population, a lower prevalence of Eustachian tube dysfunction, otitis media, headaches, and higher incidence of rhinosinusitis. Lack of patient reporting and objective testing complicate the ability to detect pediatric tinnitus.

"OBJECTIVES:: The clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are preceded by a long asymptomatic period associated with ""silent"" deposition of aberrant paired helical filament (PHF)-tau and amyloid-beta proteins in brain tissue. Similar depositions have been reported within the olfactory epithelium (OE), a tissue that can be biopsied in vivo. The degree to which such biopsies are useful in identifying AD is controversial. This postmortem study had 3 main goals: first, to quantify the relative densities of AD-related proteins in 3 regions of the olfactory neuroepithelium, namely, the nasal septum, middle turbinate, and superior turbinate; second, to establish whether such densities are correlated among these epithelial regions as well as with semi-quantitative ratings of general brain cortex pathology; and third, to evaluate correlations between the protein densities and measures of antemortem cognitive function. METHODS:: Postmortem blocks of olfactory mucosa were obtained from 12 AD cadavers and 24 controls and subjected to amyloid-beta and PHF-tau immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:: We observed marked heterogeneity in the presence of the biomarkers of tau and amyloid-beta among the targeted olfactory epithelial regions. No significant difference was observed between the cadavers with AD and the controls regarding the concentration of these proteins in any of these epithelial regions. Only one correlation significant was evident, namely, that between the tau protein densities of the middle and the upper turbinate ( r = .58, P = .002). CONCLUSION:: AD-related biomarker heterogeneity, which has not been previously demonstrated, makes comparisons across studies difficult and throws into question the usefulness of OE amyloid-beta and PHF-tau biopsies in detecting AD.",Is Olfactory Epithelium Biopsy Useful for Confirming Alzheimer's Disease?
"Synthetic magnetic resonance imaging is a novel imaging technique that allows generating multiple contrast-weighted images based on relaxivity measurements of tissue properties in a single acquisition using a multiecho, multidelay saturation recovery spin-echo sequence. The synthetic images can be generated postacquisition from the parametric tissue maps, which can be beneficial to reduce scan time and improve patient throughput. Based on relaxometry maps, synthetic magnetic resonance imaging can also perform brain tissue segmentation and myelin quantification without additional scan time. The quantitative analysis may have implications for understanding and monitoring of the evolution of the maturation process. Similarly, the myelination process is vitally important to central nervous system functioning. Measuring myelin volume could provide relevant information for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with myelination disorders.",Synthetic Brain MRI: Review of Current Concepts and Future Directions.
"OBJECTIVE: Rapid eating is a risk factor for childhood obesity but has not been a focus of intervention with young children. The short-term effects of a novel family-based treatment, ""Reduced Eating Pace"" (RePace), were tested on child eating speed and secondary outcomes. METHODS: Twenty-eight rapid eating children were randomized to RePace (n = 14) or Delayed Usual Care Control (DUC) (n = 14). RePace taught families a slower eating pace using psychoeducational and behavioral techniques, including silent vibrating devices that prompted 30-second ""turtle bites."" Outcomes included child ""slowness in eating"" assessed by parent-report questionnaire and observed eating in the laboratory (i.e., mouthfuls/minute and kilocalories/minute). Child BMI and other eating variables were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Children in RePace compared with DUC showed increased ""slowness in eating"" (P < 0.001), increased food enjoyment (P = 0.04), and less BMI gain (P = 0.02) after 8 weeks. There was no treatment effect for observed eating speed, although typicality of the laboratory test meal was an effect modifier in exploratory analyses. Specifically, RePace versus DUC showed attenuated increases in mouthfuls per minute over time among youth for whom the laboratory food amount was more typical of amounts served at home.

"BACKGROUND: Axillary venous access with ultrasound guidance for pediatric transvenous lead implantation may reduce risks for pneumothorax and hemothorax. The objective was to retrospectively evaluate ultrasound-guided axillary vein access as an alternative to the subclavian approach. METHODS: The technique consists of ultrasonographic identification of the axillary vein at the deltopectoral groove after initial contrast venography. A micropuncture kit is used for initial ultrasound-guided percutaneous access with fluoroscopic confirmation of wire position. Pocket creation is performed, and sheath insertion and lead implantation proceed as usual. Demographic, procedural, and radiation exposure data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (median age = 13 years, 8-50 years; median weight = 56 kg, 29-77 kg) underwent lead implantation; two additional patients required fluoroscopy due to poor acoustic windows (89% success). Fifteen of 21 leads (71%) were ventricular; 50% of implants were pacemakers, and 31% were dual chamber. Median time to venous access was 13 min (interquartile range (IQR) = 9.25-20.25) and median implant procedure time was 156 min (IQR = 112-172). Median fluoroscopy time was 18.0 min (IQR = 11.9-29.6), median air kerma was 9.0 mGy (IQR = 3.0-28.5), and median dose-area product was 30.2 Gy-cm(2) (IQR = 16.1-234.5). One patient required generator pocket revision 2 days postprocedure without lead dislodgement. There were no other complications encountered. CONCLUSIONS: Transvenous pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead implantation in the pediatric and adult congenital population through ultrasound-guided axillary venous access is safe and efficacious. This technique may provide a low-risk alternative for vascular access for pediatric implantation procedures.",Ultrasound-guided axillary venous access for pediatric and adult congenital lead implantation.
"SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes are multisubunit complexes that contain one of two catalytic subunits, BRG1 or BRM and 9-11 additional subunits called BRG1 or BRM-associated factors (BAFs). BRG1 interacts with the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and is required for melanocyte development in vitro and in vivo. The subunits of SWI/SNF that mediate interactions between BRG1 and MITF have not been elucidated. Three mutually exclusive isoforms of a 60-kDa subunit (BAF60A, B, or C) often facilitate interactions with transcription factors during lineage specification. We tested the hypothesis that a BAF60 subunit promotes interactions between MITF and the BRG1-containing SWI/SNF complex. We found that MITF can physically interact with BAF60A, BAF60B, and BAF60C. The interaction between MITF and BAF60A required the basic helix-loop-helix domain of MITF. Recombinant BAF60A pulled down recombinant MITF, suggesting that the interaction can occur in the absence of other SWI/SNF subunits and other transcriptional regulators of the melanocyte lineage. Depletion of BAF60A in differentiating melanoblasts inhibited melanin synthesis and expression of MITF target genes. MITF promoted BAF60A recruitment to melanocyte-specific promoters, and BAF60A was required to promote BRG1 recruitment and chromatin remodeling. Thus, BAF60A promotes interactions between MITF and the SWI/SNF complex and is required for melanocyte differentiation.",BAF60A mediates interactions between the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and the BRG1-containing SWI/SNF complex during melanocyte differentiation.
"Many infants (7-15%) spend time in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and continue to experience medical issues after discharge. Family psychological responses range widely depending on burden of care, access to resources, and parental characteristics. The current systematic review examined how infant health severity is assessed and related to family psychological (e.g., mental health) and social (e.g., parent-infant attachment) outcomes. Seventy articles were deemed relevant. Infant health was operationalized in several ways including validated assessments, indices of infant health (e.g., diagnosis, length of stay), or novel measures. Parents of infants with increased medical complications reported greater family impact, increased stress, and more intrusive parenting style. A validated assessment of infant health that utilizes parent report is warranted to allow for more accessible and easily disseminated research across medical centers.

"Caroli syndrome, which is characterized by saccular and fusiform dilatation of the biliary ducts, is usually observed in association with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Although the diagnosis of ARPKD is generally easy to make in postnatal ultrasound, the diagnosis of Caroli syndrome may be challenging in prenatal ultrasound. Herein, we present a case of a 29-week fetus with ARPKD associated with Caroli syndrome in whom fetal magnetic resonance imaging was essential to identify the ""central dot sign"" within the dilated biliary ducts to confirm the prenatal diagnosis of Caroli syndrome and to increase our level of confidence in this diagnosis.",Prenatal MR imaging features of Caroli syndrome in association with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.
"Head-down-tilt bed rest (HDT) mimics the changes in hemodynamics and autonomic cardiovascular control induced by weightlessness. However, the time course and reciprocal interplay of these adaptations, and the effective exercise protocol as a countermeasure need further clarification. The overarching aim of this work (as part of a European Space Agency sponsored long-term bed rest study) was therefore to evaluate the time course of cardiovascular hemodynamics and autonomic control during prolonged HDT and to assess whether high-intensity, short-duration exercise could mitigate these effects. A total of n = 23 healthy, young, male participants were randomly allocated to two groups: training (TRAIN, n = 12) and non-training (CTRL, n = 11) before undergoing a 60-day HDT. The TRAIN group underwent a resistance training protocol using reactive jumps (5-6 times per week), whereas the CTRL group did not perform countermeasures. Finger blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and stroke volume were collected beat-by-beat for 10 min in both sitting and supine positions 7 days before HDT (BDC-7) and 10 days after HDT (R+10), as well as on the 2nd (HDT2), 28th (HDT28), and 56th (HDT56) day of HDT. We investigated (1) the isolated effects of long-term HDT by comparing all the supine positions (including BDC-7 and R+10 at 0 degrees), and (2) the reactivity of the autonomic response before and after long-term HDT using a specific postural stimulus (i.e., supine vs. sitting). Two-factorial linear mixed models were used to assess the time course of HDT and the effect of the countermeasure. Starting from HDT28 onwards, HR increased (p < 0.02) and parasympathetic tone decreased exclusively in the CTRL group (p < 0.0001). Moreover, after 60-day HDT, CTRL participants showed significant impairments in increasing cardiac sympathovagal balance and controlling BP levels during postural shift (supine to sitting), whereas TRAIN participants did not. Results show that a 10-day recovery did not compensate for the cardiovascular and autonomic deconditioning following 60-day HDT. This has to be considered when designing rehabilitation programs-not only for astronauts but also in general public healthcare. High-intensity, short-duration exercise training effectively minimized these impairments and should therefore deserve consideration as a cardiovascular deconditioning countermeasure for spaceflight.",High-Intensity Exercise Mitigates Cardiovascular Deconditioning During Long-Duration Bed Rest.
"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: New or worsened disabilities in functional, cognitive, or mental health following an intensive care unit (ICU) stay are referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). PICS has not been described in older adults receiving home care. Our aim was to examine the relationship between length of ICU stay and PICS among older adults receiving home care. We expected that patients in the ICU for 3 days or longer would demonstrate significantly more disability in all three domains on follow-up than those not in the ICU. A secondary aim was to identify patient characteristics increasing the odds of disability. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Hospitalization for sepsis in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 21 520 Medicare patients receiving home care and reassessed a median of 1 day (interquartile range 1-2 d) after hospital discharge. MEASUREMENTS: PICS was defined as a decline or worsening in one or more of 16 indicators tested before and after hospitalization using OASIS (Home Health Outcome and Assessment Information Set) and Medicare claims data. RESULTS: The sample was predominantly female and white. All had sepsis, and most (81.8%) had severe sepsis. In adjusted models, an ICU stay of 3 days or longer, compared with no ICU stay, increased the odds of physical disability. Overall, the declines were modest and found in specific activities of daily living (16% for feeding and lower body dressing to 26% for oral medicine management). No changes were identified in cognition or mental health. Significant determinants of new or worsened physical disabilities were sepsis severity, older age, depression, frailty, and dementia. CONCLUSION: Older adults receiving home care who develop sepsis and are in an ICU for 3 days or longer are likely to develop new or worsened physical disabilities. Whether these disabilities remain after the early postdischarge phase requires further study.

"OBJECTIVES: To understand the experiences of local health jurisdictions with Senate Bill 277 (SB277), the California law that eliminated nonmedical vaccine exemptions for public- and private-school entry. METHODS: We conducted semistructured telephone interviews with health officers and local health department (LHD) staff in California between August and September 2017. RESULTS: Two overall themes emerged: (1) vague legislative and regulatory language led to variation in the interpretation and implementation of SB277, and (2) lack of centralized review of medical exemptions allowed medical exemptions that are not consistent with valid contraindications for immunizations to be accepted. Variation in the interpretation and implementation was commonly reported with provisions related to individualized education programs and special education, and independent study programs and homeschooling. Without a centralized review of medical exemption requests, respondents reported variation in the interpretation of which specialties of physicians can write medical exemptions, which conditions constitute a valid contraindication for immunization, and the process for reporting a questionable or suspicious medical exemption. CONCLUSIONS: The regulatory language within SB277 led to variation in how the law was interpreted and implemented within and across LHD jurisdictions and school districts. (Am J Public Health.

"War's burden on the health and well-being of combatants, civilians, and societies is well documented. Although the examination of soldiers' injuries in modern combat is both detailed and comprehensive, less is known about war-related injuries to civilians and refugees, including victims of torture. The societal burden of war-related disabilities persists for decades in war's aftermath. The complex injuries of combat survivors, including multiple pain conditions and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, challenge health care systems to reorganize care to meet these survivors' special needs. We use the case study method to illustrate the change in pain management strategies for injured combat survivors in one national health system, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The care of veterans' disabling injuries suffered in Vietnam contrasts with the care resulting from the VA's congressional mandate to design and implement a pain management policy that provides effective pain management to veterans injured in the recent Middle East conflicts. The outcomes-driven, patient-centric Stepped Care Model of biopsychosocial pain management requires system-wide patient education, clinician training, social networking, and administrative monitoring.

"PURPOSE: In previous work, a theoretical model of the point spread function (PSF) for oblique x-ray incidence in amorphous selenium (a-Se) detectors was proposed. The purpose of this paper is to develop a complementary model that includes two additional features. First, the incidence angle and the directionality of ray incidence are calculated at each position, assuming a divergent x-ray beam geometry. This approach allows the non-stationarity of the PSF to be modeled. Second, this paper develops a framework that is applicable to a digital system, unlike previous work which did not model the presence of a thin-film transistor (TFT) array. METHODS: At each point on the detector, the incidence angle and the ray incidence direction are determined using ray tracing. Based on these calculations, an existing model for the PSF of the x-ray converter (Med Phys. 1995;22:365-374) is generalized to a non-stationary model. The PSF is convolved with the product of two rectangle functions, which model the sampling of the TFT array. The rectangle functions match the detector element (del) size in two dimensions. RESULTS: It is shown that the PSF can be calculated in closed form. This solution is used to simulate a digital mammography (DM) system at two x-ray energies (20 and 40 keV). Based on the divergence of the x-ray beam, the direction of ray incidence varies with position. Along this direction, the PSF is broader than the reference rect function matching the del size. The broadening is more pronounced with increasing obliquity. At high energy, the PSF deviates more strongly from the reference rect function, indicating that there is more blurring. In addition, the PSF is calculated along the polar angle perpendicular to the ray incidence direction. For this polar angle, the shape of the PSF is dependent upon whether the ray incidence direction is parallel with the sides of the detector. If the ray incidence direction is parallel with either dimension, the PSF is a perfect rectangle function, matching the del size. However, if the ray incidence direction is at an oblique angle relative to the sides of the detector, the PSF is not rectangular. These results illustrate the non-stationarity of the PSF. CONCLUSIONS: This paper demonstrates that an existing model of the PSF of a-Se detectors can be generalized to include the effects of non-stationarity and digitization. The PSF is determined in closed form. This solution offers the advantage of shorter computation time relative to approaches that use numerical methods. This model is a tool for simulating a-Se detectors in future work, such as in virtual clinical trials with computational phantoms.",Non-stationary model of oblique x-ray incidence in amorphous selenium detectors: I.

"Mice engrafted with components of a human immune system have become widely-used models for studying aspects of human immunity and disease. However, a defined methodology to objectively measure and compare the quality of the human immune response in different models is lacking. Here, by taking advantage of the highly immunogenic live-attenuated yellow fever virus vaccine YFV-17D, we provide an in-depth comparison of immune responses in human vaccinees, conventional humanized mice, and second generation humanized mice. We demonstrate that selective expansion of human myeloid and natural killer cells promotes transcriptomic responses akin to those of human vaccinees. These enhanced transcriptomic profiles correlate with the development of an antigen-specific cellular and humoral response to YFV-17D. Altogether, our approach provides a robust scoring of the quality of the human immune response in humanized mice and highlights a rational path towards developing better pre-clinical models for studying the human immune response and disease.",Selective expansion of myeloid and NK cells in humanized mice yields human-like vaccine responses.
"Gene therapy is emerging as a promising approach for treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). A phase 2 clinical trial showed that delivering glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) into the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of patients with PD had therapeutic effects. To determine the mechanism underlying this response, we analyzed metabolic imaging data from patients who received gene therapy and those randomized to sham surgery, all of whom had been scanned preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Those who received GAD gene therapy developed a unique treatment-dependent polysynaptic brain circuit that we termed as the GAD-related pattern (GADRP), which reflected the formation of new polysynaptic functional pathways linking the STN to motor cortical regions. Patients in both the treatment group and the sham group expressed the previously reported placebo network (the sham surgery-related pattern or SSRP) when blinded to the treatment received. However, only the appearance of the GADRP correlated with clinical improvement in the gene therapy-treated subjects. Treatment-induced brain circuits can thus be useful in clinical trials for isolating true treatment responses and providing insight into their underlying biological mechanisms.",Gene therapy reduces Parkinson's disease symptoms by reorganizing functional brain connectivity.

": Low-dose CT (LDCT) is widely accepted as the preferred method for detecting pulmonary nodules. However, the determination of whether a nodule is benign or malignant involves either repeated scans or invasive procedures that sample the lung tissue. Noninvasive methods to assess these nodules are needed to reduce unnecessary invasive tests. In this study, we have developed a pulmonary nodule classifier (PNC) using RNA from whole blood collected in RNA-stabilizing PAXgene tubes that addresses this need. Samples were prospectively collected from high-risk and incidental subjects with a positive lung CT scan. A total of 821 samples from 5 clinical sites were analyzed. Malignant samples were predominantly stage 1 by pathologic diagnosis and 97% of the benign samples were confirmed by 4 years of follow-up. A panel of diagnostic biomarkers was selected from a subset of the samples assayed on Illumina microarrays that achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.847 on independent validation. The microarray data were then used to design a biomarker panel of 559 gene probes to be validated on the clinically tested NanoString nCounter platform. RNA from 583 patients was used to assess and refine the NanoString PNC (nPNC), which was then validated on 158 independent samples (ROC-AUC = 0.825). The nPNC outperformed three clinical algorithms in discriminating malignant from benign pulmonary nodules ranging from 6-20 mm using just 41 diagnostic biomarkers. Overall, this platform provides an accurate, noninvasive method for the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings describe a minimally invasive and clinically practical pulmonary nodule classifier that has good diagnostic ability at distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules.",A Gene Expression Classifier from Whole Blood Distinguishes Benign from Malignant Lung Nodules Detected by Low-Dose CT.
"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) procedures have been performed in the cardiac catheterization (CATH) or electrophysiology (EP) laboratory. The introduction of the miniaturized Reveal LINQ ICM has led to simplified and less invasive procedures, affording hospitals flexibility in planning where these procedures occur without compromising patient safety or outcomes. METHODS: The present analysis of the ongoing, prospective, observational, multicenter Reveal LINQ Registry sought to provide real-world feasibility and safety data regarding the ICM procedure performed in the CATH/EP lab or operating room and to compare it with insertions performed outside of these traditional hospital settings. Patients included had at least a 30-day period after the procedure to account for any adverse events. RESULTS: We analyzed 1222 patients (58.1% male, age 61.0 +/- 17.1 years) enrolled at 18 centers in the US, 17 centers in Middle East/Asia, and 15 centers in Europe. Patients were categorized into 2 cohorts according to the location of the procedure: in-lab (CATH lab, EP lab, or operating room) (n = 820, 67.1%) and out-of-lab (n = 402, 32.9%). Several differences were observed regarding baseline and procedure characteristics. However, no significant differences in the occurrence of procedure-related adverse events (AEs) were found; of 19 ICM/procedure-related AEs reported in 17 patients (1.4%), 11 occurred in the in-lab group (1.3%) and 6 in the out-of-lab group (1.5%) (P = .80). CONCLUSIONS: This real-world analysis demonstrates the feasibility of performing Reveal LINQ ICM insertion procedures outside of the traditional hospital settings without increasing the risk of infection or other adverse events.",Real-world comparison of in-hospital Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor insertion inside and outside of the cardiac catheterization or electrophysiology laboratory.
"The epithelial-specific splicing regulators Esrp1 and Esrp2 are required for mammalian development, including establishment of epidermal barrier functions. However, the mechanisms by which Esrp ablation causes defects in epithelial barriers remain undefined. We determined that the ablation of Esrp1 and Esrp2 impairs epithelial tight junction (TJ) integrity through loss of the epithelial isoform of Rho GTP exchange factor Arhgef11. Arhgef11 is required for the maintenance of TJs via RhoA activation and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Ablation or depletion of Esrp1/2 or Arhgef11 inhibits MLC phosphorylation and only the epithelial Arhgef11 isoform rescues MLC phosphorylation in Arhgef11 KO epithelial cells. Mesenchymal Arhgef11 transcripts contain a C-terminal exon that binds to PAK4 and inhibits RhoA activation byArhgef11. Deletion of the mesenchymal-specific Arhgef11 exon in Esrp1/2 KO epithelial cells using CRISPR/Cas9 restored TJ function, illustrating how splicing alterations can be mechanistically linked to disease phenotypes that result from impaired functions of splicing regulators.",Esrp1-Regulated Splicing of Arhgef11 Isoforms Is Required for Epithelial Tight Junction Integrity.

"Interactions between germline-encoded natural killer (NK) cell receptors and their respective ligands on tumorigenic or virus-infected cells determine NK cell cytotoxic activity and/or cytokine secretion. NK cell cytokine responses can be augmented in and can potentially contribute to multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system focused upon the oligodendrocytes (OLs). To investigate mechanisms by which NK cells may contribute to MS pathogenesis, we developed an in vitro human model of OL-NK cell interaction. We found that activated, but not resting human NK cells form conjugates with, and mediate cytotoxicity against, human oligodendrocytes. NK cells, when in conjugate with OLs, rapidly synthesize and polarize IFN-gamma toward the OLs. IFN-gamma is capable of reducing myelin oligodendrocyte and myelin associated glycoproteins (MOG and MAG) content. This activity is independent of MHC class-I mediated inhibition via KIR2DL1, but dependent upon the interaction between NK cell-expressed KIR2DL4 and its oligodendrocyte-expressed ligand, HLA-G. NK cells from patients with MS express higher levels of IFN-gamma following conjugation to OLs, more actively promote in vitro reduction of MOG and MAG and have higher frequencies of the KIR2DL4 positive population. These data collectively suggest a mechanism by which NK cells can promote pathogenic effects upon OLs.",KIR2DL4-HLAG interaction at human NK cell-oligodendrocyte interfaces regulates IFN-gamma-mediated effects.

"Patients undergoing stem cell transplant (SCT) for the treatment of hematologic malignancy are at increased risk for central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). The use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent CLABSIs in the setting of autologous SCT is of unclear benefit. We aimed to evaluate the impact of levofloxacin prophylaxis on reducing CLABSIs in this high-risk population. Patients undergoing autologous SCT at a tertiary care hospital received levofloxacin prophylaxis from January 13, 2016 to January 12, 2017. Levofloxacin was administered from autologous SCT (day 0) until day 13, absolute neutrophil count > 500/mm(3), or neutropenic fever, whichever occurred first. Clinical outcomes were compared with a baseline group who underwent autologous SCT but did not receive antibacterial prophylaxis during the previous year. The primary endpoint was incidence of CLABSIs assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 324 patients underwent autologous SCT during the entire study period, with 150 receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis during the intervention period. The rate of CLABSIs was reduced from 18.4% during the baseline period to 6.0% during the intervention period. On multivariable analysis levofloxacin prophylaxis significantly reduced CLABSI incidence (hazard ratio, .33; 95% confidence interval [CI], .16 to .69; P=.003). There was also a reduction in the risk of neutropenic fever (odds ratio [OR], .23; 95% CI, .14 to .39; P < .001) and a trend toward a reduction in intensive care unit transfer for sepsis (OR, .33; 95% CI, .09 to 1.24; P=.10) in patients receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis. Notably, there was no increase in Clostridium difficile infection in the levofloxacin group (OR, .66; 95% CI, .29 to 1.49; P=.32). Levofloxacin prophylaxis was effective in reducing CLABSIs and neutropenic fever in patients undergoing autologous SCT.

"OBJECTIVE: The microbiology of pediatric complicated acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) has evolved, and our current understanding of pathogenic organisms is limited. The objectives of this study are to describe the incidence of pathogens causing complicated ARS requiring surgical intervention at our institution over a 10-year period as well as their associated treatment outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A single tertiary care children's hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data were reviewed from all patients who underwent surgery for complicated ARS and had positive culture data from 2006 to 2016. Associations among pathogens, complications, and outcomes were analyzed with Pearson chi(2) and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients met criteria. Complications included orbital infections (78%), intracranial infections (48%), Pott's puffy tumor (13%), and cavernous sinus thrombosis (9.0%). Bacterial isolates were majority polymicrobial (55%) and included Streptococcus species (58%), Staphylococcus species (49%; including methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA], 11%), and anaerobic bacteria (35%). S pneumoniae (9.0%), Haemophilus species (4.5%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (1.1%) were relatively uncommon. Bacterial isolates were similar among patients with all types of complications. CONCLUSION: Among a large cohort of pediatric patients with complicated ARS, most bacterial isolates were polymicrobial, with Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species contributing to the majority of cases. S aureus species, including MRSA and anaerobic pathogens, were common. The pattern of bacterial isolates was similar among patients with all types of complications of ARS.

"Purpose: To measure the pupil response to pulses of melanopsin-directed contrast, and compare this response to those evoked by cone-directed contrast and spectrally narrowband stimuli. Methods: Three-second unipolar pulses were used to elicit pupil responses in human subjects across three sessions. Thirty subjects were studied in session 1, and most returned for sessions 2 and 3. The stimuli of primary interest were ""silent substitution"" cone- and melanopsin-directed modulations. Red and blue narrowband pulses delivered using the post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) paradigm were also studied. Sessions 1 and 2 were identical, whereas session 3 involved modulations around higher radiance backgrounds. The pupil responses were fit by a model whose parameters described response amplitude and temporal shape. Results: Group average pupil responses for all stimuli overlapped extensively across sessions 1 and 2, indicating high reproducibility. Model fits indicate that the response to melanopsin-directed contrast is prolonged relative to that elicited by cone-directed contrast. The group average cone- and melanopsin-directed pupil responses from session 3 were highly similar to those from sessions 1 and 2, suggesting that these responses are insensitive to background radiance over the range studied. The increase in radiance enhanced persistent pupil constriction to blue light. Conclusions: The group average pupil response to stimuli designed through silent substitution provides a reliable probe of the function of a melanopsin-mediated system in humans. As disruption of the melanopsin system may relate to clinical pathology, the reproducibility of response suggests that silent substitution pupillometry can test if melanopsin signals differ between clinical groups.",Pulses of Melanopsin-Directed Contrast Produce Highly Reproducible Pupil Responses That Are Insensitive to a Change in Background Radiance.
"OBJECTIVE: Over 12% of women in the United States have reduced fertility and/or fecundity. Environmental factors, such as temperature, and socioeconomic factors have been implicated in reducing female fecundity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of environmental factors coupled with socioeconomic factors on birth rate at the country-level. We use birth rate as a proxy for female fecundity. This will enable us to identify the most important factors affecting female fecundity. METHODS: Using country-specific data from 182 countries, we constructed a regression model of the effects of environmental and socioeconomic factors on birth rate at the country-level. Our model assesses the role of temperature, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, fine air particulate matter (PM 2.5), and prevalence of male and female Body Mass Index (BMI) > = 25 (age-standardized) on birth rate per country. Because many of these factors are inter-dependent, we include all possible two-way interaction terms to assess the role of individual factors and interactions between multiple factors in the model. RESULTS: In the full regression model, we found that GDP per capita along with 5 interaction terms were significant after adjusting for multiple testing. Female BMI was only nominally significant. GDP per capita was independently associated with birth rate (adjusted p-value <0.001). Prevalence of BMI > = 25 age-standardized in males and females were also significant when interacting with air pollution or GDP on female fecundity (birth rate). Temperature did not affect birth rate either independently or as an interaction unless BMI was removed from the model. CONCLUSION: A country's economic wealth was the most significant factor in predicting birth rate in a statistical model that includes environmental and socioeconomic variables. This is important for future studies investigating environmental factors involved in increasing or decreasing female fecundity.",A model investigating environmental factors that play a role in female fecundity or birth rate.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our understanding of the biologic basis of neuroblastoma, the genetic heterogeneity of this malignancy and the role of host factors has expanded significantly in recent years. In this review, we highlight current and future risk-based treatment approaches and discuss the opportunities and challenges of selecting optimal therapies for specific patient subsets. RECENT FINDINGS: Significant progress has been made in understanding neuroblastoma predisposition and new approaches have been taken to treatment of this disease. Although survival remains poor for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, current-era therapy has improved outcomes. Integration of new prognostic markers into neuroblastoma classification systems will allow more precise risk classification and refined treatment assignment. Promising treatments that include targeted therapies as well as immunotherapeutics are being evaluated in clinical trials, and new predictive biomarkers are being developed. SUMMARY: As our understanding of neuroblastoma biology deepens, our approaches to therapy for this disease continue to evolve. Improved risk stratification and the use of predictive biomarkers will aid in treatment selection for patients with neuroblastoma, and it is expected that future treatments will be associated with greater efficacy and less toxicity.",Advances in neuroblastoma therapy.

"BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in BAP1 have been associated with BAP1-Tumor Predisposition Syndrome (BAP1-TPDS), a predisposition to multiple tumors within a family that includes uveal melanoma (UM), cutaneous melanoma, malignant mesothelioma and renal cell carcinoma. Alternatively, somatic mutations in BAP1 in UM have been associated with high risk for metastasis. In this study, we compare the risk of metastasis in UM that carry germline versus somatic BAP1 mutations and mutation-negative tumors. METHODS: DNA extracted from 142 UM and matched blood samples was sequenced using Sanger or next generation sequencing to identify BAP1 gene mutations. RESULTS: Eleven of 142 UM (8%) carried germline BAP1 mutations, 43 (30%) had somatic mutations, and 88 (62%) were mutation-negative. All BAP1 mutations identified in blood samples were also present in the matched UM. There were 52 unique mutations in 54 tumors. All were pathogenic or likely pathogenic. A comparison of tumors carrying somatic vs. germline mutations, or no mutations, showed a higher frequency of metastasis in tumors carrying somatic mutations: 74% vs. 36%, P=0.03 and 74% vs. 26% P<0.001, respectively. Tumors with a somatic mutation compared to mutation-negative had an older age of diagnosis of (61.8 vs. 52.2 years, P=0.002), and shorter time to metastasis (16 vs. 26 months, P=0.04). Kaplan-Meier analysis further showed that tumors with somatic (vs. germline) mutations demonstrated a greater metastatic risk (P=0.03). Cox multivariate analysis showed in addition to chromosome-3 monosomy and larger tumor diameter, the presence of BAP1 somatic, but not germline mutations, was significantly associated with risk of metastasis(P=0.02). Personal or family history of BAP1-TPDS was available for 79 of the cases. All eight cases with germline mutations reported a history of BAP1-TPDS, which was significantly greater than what was observed in cases with somatic mutations (10 of 23, P=0.009) or mutation-negative cases (11 of 48, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Defining germline vs. somatic nature of BAP1 mutations in UM can inform the individual about both the risk of metastasis, and the time to metastasis, which are critically important outcomes for the individual. This information can also change the cascade screening and surveillance of family members.",Comparison of Germline versus Somatic BAP1 Mutations for Risk of Metastasis in Uveal Melanoma.

Since the HPO was first introduced in 2008, its users have become both more numerous and more diverse. To meet these emerging needs, the project has added new content, language translations, mappings and computational tooling, as well as integrations with external community data. The HPO continues to collaborate with clinical adopters to improve specific areas of the ontology and extend standardized disease descriptions. The newly redesigned HPO website (www.human-phenotype-ontology.org) simplifies browsing terms and exploring clinical features, diseases, and human genes.",Expansion of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) knowledge base and resources.
"Many genetic subtypes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) show signs of symptomatic disease during the earliest years of life. This might be the ideal time to intervene before progression of clinical sequelae due to demyelination and axonal loss. In the absence of disease-specific clinical trial outcome measures for CMT during infancy and early childhood the aim of this study was to develop and validate a functional measure of disease severity, known as the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Infant Scale (CMTInfS). Development projects involved identification of a preliminary pool of 31 items representing the range of disability in affected patients aged 0-4 years from a systematic review of the literature, peer review by 12 expert clinicians and researchers in the field, design of a scoring algorithm and pilot testing in 22 participants. Subsequently, a series of validation projects were conducted based on 128 assessments of: 26 confirmed cases of inherited neuropathy (17 CMT1A, one CMT1B, one CMT1D, one CMT2C, one CMT2S, two CMT4C, one CMTX3, one Riboflavin Transporter Deficiency Type 2, and one unidentified mutation); seven 'at risk' cases and 95 unaffected healthy controls recruited through the NIH-funded Inherited Neuropathies Consortium. Validation projects included: Item, Factor and Rasch analysis, intra- and inter-rater reliability, discriminant ability and convergent validity with the CMT Pediatric Scale (CMTPedS) for children aged 3-4 years. Development and validation projects produced a psychometrically robust 15-item scale. Rasch analysis supported the viability of the CMTInfS as a unidimensional measure of disease severity and showed good overall model fit, no evidence of misfitting items or persons and was well targeted for affected children. The CMTInfS demonstrated high intra-rater reliability [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)3,1 0.999, 95% confidence interval 0.996-1.000) and inter-rater reliability (ICC2,1 0.997, 95% confidence interval 0.992-0.999). The CMTInfS was able to discriminate between the CMT group and controls (P = 0.006), and convergent validity demonstrated good agreement between CMTInfS and CMTPedS scores (r = 0.76, P = 0.01). The final version of the CMTInfS requires 20 min to administer and is a reliable and sensitive functional outcome measure for early onset CMT and related neuropathies.10.1093/brain/awy280_video1awy280media15970672819001.",Development and validation of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Infant Scale.
"A pilot community-based randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the effects of the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) to a teaching sequence using a high-tech Speech Generating Device (SGD) to teach social communication behaviors. The two approaches were compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the newer, more high-tech intervention using technology to improve social and communicative behavior of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. A total of 35 school-age children were randomized to either a high-tech (SGD device) or low-tech (PECS cards) form of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). Study participants received 4 months of communication training delivered in their classrooms, and the primary outcome measures of the trial were several functional communication skills emphasized in the PECS teaching sequence. Results indicated that both high-tech and low-tech AAC approaches resulted in significant improvements in communication, and that these improvements did not differ significantly between the two approaches. These findings support the use of high-tech AAC, and highlight the need for evidence-based guidelines for its use as well as evaluation with individuals with a range impairments and disabilities.

"Glia are important modulators of neural activity, yet few studies link glia to sleep regulation. We find that blocking activity of the endocytosis protein, dynamin, in adult Drosophila glia increases sleep and enhances sleep need, manifest as resistance to sleep deprivation. Surface glia comprising the fly equivalent of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) mediate the effect of dynamin on sleep. Blocking dynamin in the surface glia causes ultrastructural changes, albeit without compromising the integrity of the barrier. Supporting a role for endocytic trafficking in sleep, a screen of Rab GTPases identifies sleep-modulating effects of the recycling endosome Rab11 in surface glia. We also find that endocytosis is increased in BBB glia during sleep and reflects sleep need. We propose that endocytic trafficking through the BBB represents a function of sleep.",Endocytosis at the Drosophila blood-brain barrier as a function for sleep.
"Changes in cancer cell identity can alter malignant potential and therapeutic response. Loss of the pulmonary lineage specifier NKX2-1 augments the growth of KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma and causes pulmonary to gastric transdifferentiation. Here, we show that the transcription factors FoxA1 and FoxA2 are required for initiation of mucinous NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinomas in the mouse and for activation of their gastric differentiation program. Foxa1/2 deletion severely impairs tumor initiation and causes a proximal shift in cellular identity, yielding tumors expressing markers of the squamocolumnar junction of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, we observe downregulation of FoxA1/2 expression in the squamous component of both murine and human lung adenosquamous carcinoma. Using sequential in vivo recombination, we find that FoxA1/2 loss in established KRAS-driven neoplasia originating from SPC-positive alveolar cells induces keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, NKX2-1, FoxA1 and FoxA2 coordinately regulate the growth and identity of lung cancer in a context-specific manner.",FoxA1 and FoxA2 drive gastric differentiation and suppress squamous identity in NKX2-1-negative lung cancer.

"Most research examining the consequences of suppressing emotional expression has focused on either experimentally manipulated and conscious suppression, or self-reported suppression behavior. This study examined suppression as it naturally occurred in couple (n = 105) discussions regarding a challenging topic. A Suppression Index (SI) was created by calculating the difference between continuous self-reports of emotional experience, obtained using cued video recall, and coders' continuous ratings of expressed emotion. Suppression was common for both men and women, though there was also substantial individual variation. Autocorrelations of the SI were used to tap suppressive rigidity (Srig), or the tendency to inflexibly use suppression throughout the discussions. Srig scores were consistent within individuals across repeated conversations and varied across individuals, suggesting that Srig captures stable individual differences. Women's greater suppression of negative emotions combined with more rigid use of suppression was associated with their own lower relationship satisfaction but not their partners'. These findings indicate that suppressive behavior may be linked to relationship quality, and that it is not just the use of suppression that may matter but how rigidly one applies this regulatory approach.

"Introduction The popularity of online physician rating websites has risen substantially. These third-party sites have the potential to significantly influence patients' perception of their healthcare providers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate online ratings of U.S. radiation oncologists (ROs) on Vitals.com, one of the most popular physician rating websites, and the variables that most significantly affect patients' overall rating (OR) of their ROs. Methods The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Physician Comparable Downloadable File was analyzed to obtain data on all self-identified ROs in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Patient Review Satisfaction Scores (PRSS) that ranged from one (poor) to five (excellent) for the following variables were recorded: OR, accurate diagnosis, spending appropriate time with patients, ease of appointment, courteous staff, bedside manner, follow-up after visit, promptness, and wait time. Associations among these factors were assessed. Results Of 4,443 self-identifying Medicare-accepting ROs, 1,797 (40.4%) ROs who had at least one OR rating and at least one written comment were included in this study. The ROs' mean OR was 4.34 +/- 0.2 (median 4; 30% received a score of 5; 78% received a score greater than 4). OR was found to have a strong correlation with accuracy of diagnosis (r = 0.69), bedside manner (r = 0.71), and spends appropriate time with patients (r = 0.69). With the exception of the number of ratings (p = 0.07), physicians with over 10 years of experience showed statistically significant differences in how much better they scored in each of the variables compared to those with less than 10 years of experience (p < 0.01 for each characteristic). Significant differences in OR were also observed between ROs whose wait times exceeded 20 minutes compared to those with wait times less than 10 minutes (p < 0.01) for all internal and external metrics except for the number of ratings (p = 0.42) and number of reviews (p = 0.88) Conclusion Patients are providing high ratings for their ROs on Vitals.com and are more frequently recommending them to friends and family. Given the rise in popularity of third-party physician rating sites, it is important for ROs to understand the various factors that may influence their online ratings.",How Do Patients Rate Their Radiation Oncologists in the Modern Era: An Analysis of Vitals.com.
"INTRODUCTION: Anatomic characteristics of kidneys derived from ultrasound images are potential biomarkers of children with congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), but current methods are limited by the lack of automated processes that accurately classify diseased and normal kidneys. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of deep transfer learning techniques to classify kidneys of normal children and those with CAKUT. STUDY DESIGN: A transfer learning method was developed to extract features of kidneys from ultrasound images obtained during routine clinical care of 50 children with CAKUT and 50 controls. To classify diseased and normal kidneys, support vector machine classifiers were built on the extracted features using (1) transfer learning imaging features from a pretrained deep learning model, (2) conventional imaging features, and (3) their combination. These classifiers were compared, and their diagnosis performance was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. RESULTS: The AUC for classifiers built on the combination features were 0.92, 0.88, and 0.92 for discriminating the left, right, and bilateral abnormal kidney scans from controls with classification rates of 84%, 81%, and 87%; specificity of 84%, 74%, and 88%; and sensitivity of 85%, 88%, and 86%, respectively. These classifiers performed better than classifiers built on either the transfer learning features or the conventional features alone (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The present study validated transfer learning techniques for imaging feature extraction of ultrasound images to build classifiers for distinguishing children with CAKUT from controls. The experiments have demonstrated that the classifiers built on the transfer learning features and conventional image features could distinguish abnormal kidney images from controls with AUCs greater than 0.88, indicating that classification of ultrasound kidney scans has a great potential to aid kidney disease diagnosis. A limitation of the present study is the moderate number of patients that contributed data to the transfer learning approach. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of transfer learning and conventional imaging features yielded the best classification performance for distinguishing children with CAKUT from controls based on ultrasound images of kidneys.",Computer-aided diagnosis of congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract in children based on ultrasound imaging data by integrating texture image features and deep transfer learning image features.
"Dysfunction of motile monocilia, altering the leftward flow at the embryonic node essential for determination of left-right body asymmetry, is a major cause of laterality defects. Laterality defects are also often associated with reduced mucociliary clearance caused by defective multiple motile cilia of the airway and are responsible for destructive airway disease. Outer dynein arms (ODAs) are essential for ciliary beat generation, and human respiratory cilia contain different ODA heavy chains (HCs): the panaxonemally distributed gamma-HC DNAH5, proximally located beta-HC DNAH11 (defining ODA type 1), and the distally localized beta-HC DNAH9 (defining ODA type 2). Here we report loss-of-function mutations in DNAH9 in five independent families causing situs abnormalities associated with subtle respiratory ciliary dysfunction. Consistent with the observed subtle respiratory phenotype, high-speed video microscopy demonstrates distally impaired ciliary bending in DNAH9 mutant respiratory cilia. DNAH9-deficient cilia also lack other ODA components such as DNAH5, DNAI1, and DNAI2 from the distal axonemal compartment, demonstrating an essential role of DNAH9 for distal axonemal assembly of ODAs type 2. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicate interaction of DNAH9 with the ODA components DNAH5 and DNAI2 as well as the ODA-docking complex component CCDC114. We further show that during ciliogenesis of respiratory cilia, first proximally located DNAH11 and then distally located DNAH9 is assembled in the axoneme. We propose that the beta-HC paralogs DNAH9 and DNAH11 achieved specific functional roles for the distinct axonemal compartments during evolution with human DNAH9 function matching that of ancient beta-HCs such as that of the unicellular Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.",Recessive DNAH9 Loss-of-Function Mutations Cause Laterality Defects and Subtle Respiratory Ciliary-Beating Defects.
"OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative contributions of patient and surgeon factors for predicting selection of ileal conduit (IC), neobladder (NB), or continent pouch (CP) urinary diversions (UD) for patients diagnosed with muscle-invasive/high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. This information is needed to enhance research comparing cancer survivors' outcomes across different surgical treatment options. METHODS: Bladder cancer patients' age >/=21 years with cystectomy/UD performed from January 2010 to June 2015 in 3 Kaiser Permanente regions were included. All patient and surgeon data were obtained from electronic health records. A mixed effects logistic regression model was used treating surgeon as a random effect and region as a fixed effect. RESULTS: Of 991 eligible patients, 794 (80%) received IC. One hundred sixty-nine surgeons performed the surgeries and accounted for a sizeable proportion of the variability in patient receipt of UD (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.26). The multilevel model with only patient factors showed good fit (area under the curve=0.93, Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=.44), and older age, female sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate <45, 4+ comorbidity index score, and stage III/IV tumors were associated with higher odds of receiving an IC vs neobladder/continent pouch. However, including surgeon factors (annual cystectomy volume, specialty training, clinical tenure) had no association (P=.29). CONCLUSION: In this community setting, patient factors were major predictors of UD received. Surgeons also played a substantial role, yet clinical training and experience were not major predictors. Surgeon factors such as beliefs about UD options and outcomes should be explored.",Factors That Influence Selectionof Urinary Diversion Among Bladder Cancer Patients in 3 Community-based Integrated Health Care Systems.
"PURPOSE: To assess the impact of a masked Endpoint Committee on estimates of the incidence of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) treatment efficacy and statistical power of the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study-Phase 1, 1994-2002 (OHTS-1). DESIGN: Retrospective interrater reliability analysis of endpoint attribution by the Endpoint Committee. METHODS: After study closeout, we recalculated estimates of endpoint incidence, treatment efficacy, and statistical power using all-cause endpoints and POAG endpoints. To avoid bias, only the first endpoint per participant is included in this report. RESULTS: The Endpoint Committee reviewed 267 first endpoints from 1636 participants. The Endpoint Committee attributed 58% (155 of 267) of the endpoints to POAG. The incidence of all-cause endpoints vs POAG endpoints was 19.5% and 13.2%, respectively, in the observation group and 13.1% and 5.8%, respectively, in the medication group. Treatment effect for all-cause endpoints was a 33% reduction in risk (relative risk = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.54-0.84) and a 56% reduction in risk for POAG endpoints (relative risk = 0.44, 95% CI of 0.31-0.61). Post hoc statistical power for detecting treatment effect was 0.94 for all-cause endpoints and 0.99 for POAG endpoints. CONCLUSION: Endpoint Committee adjudication of endpoints improved POAG incidence estimates, increased statistical power, and increased calculated treatment effect by 23%. An Endpoint Committee should be considered in therapeutic trials when common ocular and systemic comorbidities, other than the target condition, could compromise study results.",Assessment of the Impact of an Endpoint Committee in the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study.
"PURPOSE: Rapid repeat pregnancy is common among adolescent mothers and is associated with increased risks of adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes. Increasing contraceptive uptake among postpartum adolescents may decrease these outcomes through pregnancy prevention. This randomized controlled trial of 100 postpartum adolescent women assessed the effect of a standardized immediate postpartum contraceptive counseling intervention emphasizing healthy birth spacing and the use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC). METHODS: After a baseline survey about reproductive health and pregnancy intentions, all subjects received routine postpartum contraceptive counseling. The intervention group also received the standardized counseling intervention. All participants had access to immediate postpartum contraceptive implant initiation or to intrauterine device (IUD) insertion at postpartum follow-up. Contraceptive use and repeat pregnancy were assessed quarterly for 12 months. Differences in repeat pregnancy, as well as contraceptive initiation, continuation, and satisfaction were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no difference in repeat pregnancy or contraceptive initiation, continuation or satisfaction between the study groups. However, regardless of group assignment, all subjects who desired the contraceptive implant used the method, compared to 15% of subjects who desired the IUD (p < 0.001). Three pregnancies occurred among subjects who desired the IUD versus none amongst subjects who desired the implant (p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: This standardized postpartum contraceptive counseling intervention did not affect teens' repeat pregnancies or contraceptive use. However, immediate postpartum availability of the contraceptive implant was associated with increased utilization of this method when compared to the IUD. Future postpartum contraceptive efforts should investigate procedures to improve teens' access to postpartum contraception. CLINICALTRIALS.

"Wolbachia are endosymbiotic bacteria present in a wide range of invertebrates. Although their dramatic effects on host reproductive biology have been well studied, little is known about the effects of Wolbachia on the learning and memory capacity (LMC) of hosts, despite their distribution in the host nervous system, including brain. In this study, we found that Wolbachia infection significantly enhanced LMC in both Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Expression of LMC-related genes was significantly increased in the head of D. melanogaster infected with the wMel strain, and among these genes, crebA was up-regulated the most. Knockdown of crebA in Wolbachia-infected flies significantly decreased LMC, while overexpression of crebA in Wolbachia-free flies significantly enhanced the LMC of flies. More importantly, a microRNA (miRNA), dme-miR-92b, was identified to be complementary to the 3'UTR of crebA. Wolbachia infection was correlated with reduced expression of dme-miR-92b in D. melanogaster, and dme-miR-92b negatively regulated crebA through binding to its 3'UTR region. Overexpression of dme-miR-92b in Wolbachia-infected flies by microinjection of agomirs caused a significant decrease in crebA expression and LMC, while inhibition of dme-miR-92b in Wolbachia-free flies by microinjection of antagomirs resulted in a significant increase in crebA expression and LMC. These results suggest that Wolbachia may improve LMC in Drosophila by altering host gene expression through a miRNA-target pathway. Our findings help better understand the host-endosymbiont interactions and, in particular, the impact of Wolbachia on cognitive processes in invertebrate hosts.",Wolbachia infection may improve learning and memory capacity of Drosophila by altering host gene expression through microRNA.
"The emergence of asymmetry from an initially symmetrical state is a universal transition in nature. Living organisms show asymmetries at the molecular, cellular, tissular, and organismal level. However, whether and how multilevel asymmetries are related remains unclear. In this study, we show that Drosophila myosin 1D (Myo1D) and myosin 1C (Myo1C) are sufficient to generate de novo directional twisting of cells, single organs, or the whole body in opposite directions. Directionality lies in the myosins' motor domain and is swappable between Myo1D and Myo1C. In addition, Myo1D drives gliding of actin filaments in circular, counterclockwise paths in vitro. Altogether, our results reveal the molecular motor Myo1D as a chiral determinant that is sufficient to break symmetry at all biological scales through chiral interaction with the actin cytoskeleton.",Molecular to organismal chirality is induced by the conserved myosin 1D.
Temporal bone high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are valuable tools in the evaluation of pediatric hearing loss. Computed tomography is important in the evaluation of pediatric conductive hearing loss and is the imaging modality of choice for evaluation of osseous abnormalities. MR imaging is the modality of choice for evaluation of sensorineural hearing loss. A broad spectrum of imaging findings can be seen with hearing loss in children. HRCT and MR imaging provide complementary information and are often used in conjunction in the preoperative evaluation of pediatric candidates for cochlear implantation.,Imaging of Pediatric Hearing Loss.
"Mammalian wounds typically heal by fibrotic repair without hair follicle (HF) regeneration. Fibrosis and regeneration are currently considered the opposite end of wound healing. This study sought to determine if scar could be remodeled to promote healing with HF regeneration. Here, we identify that activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway reinstalls a regenerative dermal niche, called dermal papilla, which is required and sufficient for HF neogenesis (HFN). Epidermal Shh overexpression or constitutive Smoothened dermal activation results in extensive HFN in wounds that otherwise end in scarring. While long-term Wnt activation is associated with fibrosis, Shh signal activation in Wnt active cells promotes the dermal papilla fate in scarring wounds. These studies demonstrate that mechanisms of scarring and regeneration are not distant from one another and that wound repair can be redirected to promote regeneration following injury by modifying a key dermal signal.",Hedgehog stimulates hair follicle neogenesis by creating inductive dermis during murine skin wound healing.
"BACKGROUND: Hypoalbuminemia is a known risk factor for poor outcomes following surgery. Obesity can be associated with modest to severe malnutrition. We evaluated the impact of hypoalbuminemia on surgical outcomes in patients with obesity undergoing elective bariatric surgical procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 2015 metabolic and bariatric surgery accreditation and quality improvement program database was queried. Patients >/= 18 y with body mass index >/=35 undergoing bariatric surgery were included. Revision procedures were excluded. Patients were classified by albumin level (albumin >/=3.5 g/dL [normal], 3.49-3.0 g/dL [mild], 2.99-2.5 g/dL [moderate], and <2.5 g/dL [severe]). Independent logistic regression models were developed to estimate the adjusted odds of (1) death or serious morbidity (DSM); (2) mild to moderate complications; (3) severe complications; and (4) 30-d readmissions by albumin level. In addition, effect modification by >10% weight loss was examined. RESULTS: A total of 106,577 patients were included in the study. Over 6% of patients had hypoalbuminemia. Fifty-five percent of complications were severe as categorized by the Clavien-Dindo classification. Patients with mild hypoalbuminemia had 20% increased odds of DSM (95% confidence interval: 1.1-1.4). There was increasing likelihood of DSM with severe hypoalbuminemia. Patients with mild hypoalbuminemia had 20% increased odds of 30-d readmission (confidence interval: 1.1-1.3). A >10% weight loss modified the effect of moderate to severe hypoalbuminemia on DSM. CONCLUSIONS: More than 6% of patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery are malnourished. Hypoalbuminemia is an important and modifiable risk factor for postoperative adverse outcomes following bariatric surgery. Preoperative weight loss >10% combined with moderate to severe hypoalbuminemia is synergistic for high rates of DSM and should be addressed before proceeding with bariatric surgery.",The Malnourished Patient With Obesity: A Unique Paradox in Bariatric Surgery.
"INTRODUCTION:: Many international guidelines for management of psoriasis exist and most have variations in grading evidence quality, strength of recommendations, and dosing. The objective of our review is to compare international guidelines published in the United Kingdom, Canada, Europe, and the United States for the management of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS:: We conducted a literature review on systemic therapies and phototherapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients. The British, Canadian, European, and American guidelines served as the key comparators in our review. To identify relevant supporting clinical trials not referenced in the guidelines, we conducted literature searches in PubMed and EMBASE. Two authors independently extracted data on indications, dosing, efficacy, evidence grade, and strength of clinical recommendation for each therapy. RESULTS:: Monoclonal antibodies directed toward tumour necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-12/23 received the strongest recommendations for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, supported by robust, high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Newer agents such as IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors are not referenced in most guidelines. There are fewer RCTs for conventional therapies and few head-to-head comparisons with biologics, making it difficult to draw direct comparisons. Among older agents, methotrexate is most strongly recommended for long-term maintenance and cyclosporine is recommended for short-term control of flares. CONCLUSION:: Physicians should individualize psoriasis-management strategies based on medication tolerance, efficacy, safety, patient comorbidities, availability of the medication, and patient preference.","Comparison of Management Guidelines for Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis: A Review of Phototherapy, Systemic Therapies, and Biologic Agents."
"OBJECTIVES: Wait times for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) evaluations are long, thereby delaying access to ASD-specific services. We asked how our traditional care model (requiring all patients to see psychologists for ASD diagnostic decisions) compared to an alternative model that better utilizes the available clinicians, including initial evaluation by speech, audiology, and pediatrics (trained in Level 2 autism screening tools). Pediatricians could diagnose immediately if certain about diagnosis but could refer uncertain cases to psychology. Accuracy and time to diagnosis, charges, and parent satisfaction were our main outcome measures. METHODS: Data were gathered through record extraction (n = 244) and parent questionnaire (n = 57). We compared time to diagnosis, charges, and parent satisfaction between traditional and alternative models. Agreement between pediatrician and psychologist diagnoses was examined for a subset (n = 18). RESULTS: The alternative model's time to diagnosis was 44% faster (85 vs 152 d) and 33% less costly overall. Diagnostic agreement was 93% for children with ASD diagnoses and 100% for children without ASD diagnoses. Pediatricians expressed higher diagnostic certainty about children with higher levels of ASD symptoms. Parents reported no differences in high satisfaction with experiences, family-centered care, and shared decision making. CONCLUSION: Efficient use of available clinicians with additional training in Level 2 autism screening resulted in improvements in time to diagnosis and reduced charges for families. Coordination of multidisciplinary teams makes this possible, with strategic sequencing of patients through workflow. Flexibility was key to not only allowing pediatricians to refer uncertain cases to psychology for diagnosis but also allowing for diagnosis by a pediatrician when symptomatic presentation clearly met diagnostic criteria.",A Pilot Project Using Pediatricians as Initial Diagnosticians in Multidisciplinary Autism Evaluations for Young Children.
"The relatively young field of pediatric critical care has seen a shift from an approach with little consideration for the complications and adverse effects resulting from the procedures and medications to a more cautious approach with careful concern for the associated risks. Many senior pediatric intensivists recall a time when nearly every patient had a central venous line and arterial line; and hospital acquired infections, pressure injuries, unplanned extubations, and venous thromboemboli were expected costs of aggressive care. In addition to the morbidity and mortality associated with many of the health care-acquired conditions (HACs) in children, the attributable cost due to these HACs contributes to the unsustainable health care financial crisis. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) often penalize hospitals for HACs, and also are beginning to reimburse in a bundled fashion such that complications become the institution's burden. In children, payors and patients' families are often saddling this burden of costs attributable to HACs. The direct attributable costs per event are staggering. Payors, families, patients, and health care teams now demand a circumspect approach to care: do no harm, but how?",Making care better in the pediatric intensive care unit.
"Amino acid abnormalities are observed in a broad spectrum of inherited metabolic diseases, such as disorders of amino acid metabolism and transport, organic acidemias, and ureagenesis defects. Comprehensive analysis of physiologic amino acids in blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid is typically performed in the following clinical settings: evaluation of symptomatic patients in whom a diagnosis is not known; evaluation of previously diagnosed patients to monitor treatment efficacy; evaluation of asymptomatic or presymptomatic (at-risk) relatives of known patients; follow-up testing for an abnormal newborn screen; and assessment of dietary protein adequacy or renal function in general patient populations. Currently, the most common analytical method to quantify amino acids is based on ion exchange chromatography using post-column derivatization with ninhydrin and spectrophotometric detection. Newer methodologies are based on liquid chromatographic separation with detection by mass spectrometry or spectrophotometry. Amino acid analysis by nonseparation methods, such as the flow injection-tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) method used for newborn screening, is considered inadequate for the diagnosis of at-risk patients. The purpose of this document is to provide a technical standard for amino acid analysis as applied to the diagnosis and management of inborn errors of metabolism.","Laboratory analysis of amino acids, 2018 revision: a technical standard of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)."
"AIMS: To determine whether cannabis use during adolescence can increase risk not only for cannabis use disorder (CUD) but also for conduct problems, potentially mediated by exposure to peers who use cannabis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal study analyzing four waves of longitudinal data from 364 racially and socio-economically diverse, urban, US community youth (at baseline: Mage = 13.51 (0.95); 49.1% female). MEASUREMENTS: Self-reports of cannabis use, conduct problems, proportion of peers using cannabis and CUD criteria at the final wave were analyzed using a method sensitive to changes over development, the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model. FINDINGS: Change in cannabis use did not predict changes in conduct problems or peer cannabis use over time, controlling for gender, race-ethnicity and socio-economic status. Instead, increases in conduct problems predicted increases in cannabis use and ultimately CUD, with some of the effect mediated by increases in the prevalence of peer cannabis use [beta = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.07, 0.20]. Additionally, affiliation with peers who used cannabis predicted subsequent CUD via increased personal cannabis use (beta = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.04, 0.14). Significant within-person betas for the cross-lagged effects ranged between 0.20 and 0.27. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in adolescence does not appear to lead to greater conduct problems or association with cannabis-using peers apart from pre-existing conduct problems. Instead, adolescents who (1) increasingly affiliate with cannabis-using peers or (2) have increasing levels of conduct problems are more likely to use cannabis, and this cascading chain of events appears to predict cannabis use disorder in emerging adulthood.","Disentangling longitudinal relations between youth cannabis use, peer cannabis use, and conduct problems: developmental cascading links to cannabis use disorder."

Current single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are limited in the number of targets that can be interrogated and cannot detect all variation of interest. We designed a transfusion medicine array (TM-Array) for study of both common and rare transfusion-relevant variations in genetically diverse donor and recipient populations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The array was designed by conducting extensive bioinformatics mining and consulting experts to identify genes and genetic variation related to a wide range of transfusion medicine clinical relevant and research-related topics. Copy number polymorphisms were added in the alpha globin, beta globin, and Rh gene clusters. RESULTS: The final array contains approximately 879,000 SNP and copy number polymorphism markers. Over 99% of SNPs were called reliably. Technical replication showed the array to be robust and reproducible, with an error rate less than 0.03%. The array also had a very low Mendelian error rate (average parent-child trio accuracy of 0.9997). Blood group results were in concordance with serology testing results, and the array accurately identifies rare variants (minor allele frequency of 0.5%). The array achieved high genome-wide imputation coverage for African-American (97.5%), Hispanic (96.1%), East Asian (94.6%), and white (96.1%) genomes at a minor allele frequency of 5%. CONCLUSIONS: A custom array for transfusion medicine research has been designed and evaluated. It gives wide coverage and accurate identification of rare SNPs in diverse populations. The TM-Array will be useful for future genetic studies in the diverse fields of transfusion medicine research.",Development and evaluation of a transfusion medicine genome wide genotyping array.
"Chordomas are rare, infiltrative neoplasms of notochordal origin that present along the spinal canal; en bloc surgical resection is paramount to successful treatment. Limited visualization and complex anatomy are major challenges to resection of upper cervical spine chordomas and often require invasive surgery. A 27-year-old male presented with an incidentally discovered chordoma of the midline second cervical vertebra of the spine. To obtain en bloc resection of the lesion while both overcoming limitations due to access and without introducing morbidity from traditional anterior approaches, we elected using transoral robotic surgery for resection. Due to complete resection, the patient remains disease-free and was spared adjuvant radiation.

"Systematic analysis of human arginine methylation identifies two distinct signaling modes; either isolated modifications akin to canonical post-translational modification regulation, or clustered arrays within disordered protein sequence. Hundreds of proteins contain these methyl-arginine arrays and are more prone to accumulate mutations and more tightly expression-regulated than dispersed methylation targets. Arginines within an array in the highly methylated RNA-binding protein synaptotagmin binding cytoplasmic RNA interacting protein (SYNCRIP) were experimentally shown to function in concert, providing a tunable protein interaction interface. Quantitative immunoprecipitation assays defined two distinct cumulative binding mechanisms operating across 18 proximal arginine-glycine (RG) motifs in SYNCRIP. Functional binding to the methyltransferase PRMT1 was promoted by continual arginine stretches, whereas interaction with the methyl-binding protein SMN1 was arginine content-dependent irrespective of linear position within the unstructured region. This study highlights how highly repetitive modifiable amino acid arrays in low structural complexity regions can provide regulatory platforms, with SYNCRIP as an extreme example how arginine methylation leverages these disordered sequences to mediate cellular interactions.",Interaction modulation through arrays of clustered methyl-arginine protein modifications.
"Introduction: This study describes the demographics, aetiology, emergency centre diagnosis and severity indicators of patients with head injuries presenting to the largest referral hospital emergency centre in Botswana. Methods: Cross-sectional retrospective data was collected from July 2015 to September 2015 for all emergency centre head injury presentations at Princess Marina Hospital. Information was extracted from emergency centre records regarding patient demographics, mechanism of injury, clinical observations, diagnosis, and treatment. Results: Three-hundred and sixty head injury patients presented to the emergency centre in the three months, averaging four per day. 80% were less than 40years of age and males accounted for 69% of all presentations. 58% of injuries were listed as being accidental, 39% recorded from assaults and 38% from road traffic accidents. The most common emergency centre clinical diagnosis was concussion and the most common radiological diagnosis skull fracture. The median Glasgow Coma Scale was 15 with a range from 3 to 15; and, among patients for whom Revised Trauma Score could be calculated, 79% scored the lowest probability of death in the Revised Trauma Score. Discussion: Head injury disproportionately overburdened males in this study, and head injury aetiology and demographic picture was similar to regional data. Severity scoring using the Glasgow Coma Scale was only available among 66% of patients and Revised Trauma Score calculable in half of presentations. Only 55% of head injury patients were discharged from the emergency centre, despite the preponderance of low severity scores. Head CTs appear to have been over-utilised and implementation of a Traumatic Head CT guideline for our setting is proposed. This study improves understanding of the burden of head injury in Botswana and advocates for national referral guidelines for patients with head injury in Botswana.",Head injury burden in a major referral hospital emergency centre in Botswana.
"Background: Priority setting in a climate of diverse needs and limited resources is one of the most significant challenges faced by health care policymakers. This paper develops and applies a comprehensive multi-criteria algorithm to help determine the relative importance of health conditions that affect a defined population. Methods: Our algorithm is implemented in the context of the Waikato District Health Board (WDHB) in New Zealand, which serves approximately 10% of the New Zealand population. Strategic priorities of the WDHB are operationalized into five criteria along which the algorithm is structured-scale of disease, household financial impact of disease, health equity, cost-effectiveness, and multimorbidity burden. Using national-level data and published literature from New Zealand, the World Health Organization, and other high-income Commonwealth countries, 25 health conditions in Waikato are identified and mapped to these five criteria. These disease-criteria mappings are weighted with data from an ordered choice survey administered to the general public of the Waikato region. The resulting output of health conditions ranked in order of relative importance is validated against an explicit list of health concerns, provided by the survey respondents. Results: Heart disease and cancerous disorders are assigned highest priority rankings according to both the algorithm and the survey data, suggesting that our model is aligned with the primary health concerns of the general public. All five criteria are weighted near-equal across survey respondents, though the average health equity preference score is 9.2% higher for Maori compared to non-Maori respondents. Older respondents (50 years and above) ranked issues of multimorbidity 4.2% higher than younger respondents. Conclusions: Health preferences of the general population can be elicited using ordered-choice surveys and can be used to weight data for health conditions across multiple criteria, providing policymakers with a practical tool to inform which health conditions deserve the most attention. Our model connects public health strategic priorities, the health impacts and financial costs of particular health conditions, and the underlying preferences of the general public. We illustrate a practical approach to quantifying the foundational criteria that drive public preferences, for the purpose of relevant, legitimate, and evidence-based priority setting in health.",Priority setting in health: development and application of a multi-criteria algorithm for the population of New Zealand's Waikato region.
"Epigenetic regulators are attractive anticancer targets, but the promise of therapeutic strategies inhibiting some of these factors has not been proven in vivo or taken into account tumor cell heterogeneity. Here we show that the histone methyltransferase G9a, reported to be a therapeutic target in many cancers, is a suppressor of aggressive lung tumor-propagating cells (TPCs). Inhibition of G9a drives lung adenocarcinoma cells towards the TPC phenotype by de-repressing genes which regulate the extracellular matrix. Depletion of G9a during tumorigenesis enriches tumors in TPCs and accelerates disease progression metastasis. Depleting histone demethylases represses G9a-regulated genes and TPC phenotypes. Demethylase inhibition impairs lung adenocarcinoma progression in vivo. Therefore, inhibition of G9a is dangerous in certain cancer contexts, and targeting the histone demethylases is a more suitable approach for lung cancer treatment. Understanding cellular context and specific tumor populations is critical when targeting epigenetic regulators in cancer for future therapeutic development.",H3K9 methyltransferases and demethylases control lung tumor-propagating cells and lung cancer progression.
"BACKGROUND: Successful treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is essential to reduce tuberculosis (TB) incidence rates in low-burden countries. This study measures treatment completion and determinants of non-completion of LTBI treatment in Norway in 2016. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included all individuals notified with LTBI treatment to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Infectious Diseases (MSIS) in 2016. We obtained data from MSIS and from a standardized form that was sent to health care providers at the time of patient notification to MSIS. We determined completion rates. Pearson's chi squared test was used to study associations between pairs of categorical variables and separate crude and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with treatment completion and adverse drug effects. RESULTS: We obtained information on treatment completion from 719 of the 726 individuals notified for LTBI treatment in 2016. Overall, 91% completed treatment. Treatment completion was highest in the foreign-born group [foreign-born, n = 562 (92%) vs Norwegian-born, n = 115 (85%), p = 0.007]. Treatment completion did not differ significantly between prescribed regimens (p = 0.124). Adverse events were the most common reason for incomplete treatment. We found no significant differences in adverse events when comparing weekly rifapentine (3RPH) with three months daily isoniazid and rifampicin (3RH). However, there were significantly fewer adverse events with 3RPH compared to other regimens (p = 0.037). Age over 35 years was significantly associated with adverse events irrespective of regimen (p = 0.024), whereas immunosuppression was not significantly associated with adverse events after adjusting for other variables (p = 0.306). Treatment under direct observation had a significant effect on treatment completion for foreign-born (multivariate Wald p-value = 0.017), but not for Norwegian-born (multivariate Wald p-value = 0.408) individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We report a very high treatment completion rate, especially among individuals from countries with high TB incidence. The follow-up from tuberculosis-coordinators and the frequent use of directly observed treatment probably contributes to this. Few severe adverse events were reported, even with increased age and in individuals that are more susceptible. While these results are promising, issues of cost-effectiveness and targeting treatment to individuals at highest risk of TB are important components of public health impact.",Treatment completion for latent tuberculosis infection in Norway: a prospective cohort study.

"Introduction: Network theories of psychopathology highlight that, rather than being indicators of a latent disorder, symptoms of disorders can causally interact with one another in a network. The present study examined tobacco withdrawal from a network perspective. Methods: Participants (n = 525, 50.67% female) completed the Minnesota Tobacco Withdrawal Scale (MTWS) four times (2 weeks prior to a target quit day, on the target quit day, and 4 and 8 weeks after the target quit day) over the course of 8 weeks of treatment with nicotine patch and behavioral counseling within a randomized clinical trial testing long-term nicotine patch therapy in treatment-seeking smokers. The conditional dependence among 7 withdrawal symptoms was estimated at each of the four measurement occasions. Influential symptoms of withdrawal were identified using centrality indices. Changes in network structure were examined using the network comparison test. Results: Findings indicated many associations among the individual symptoms of withdrawal. The strongest associations that emerged were between sleep problems and restlessness, and associations among affective symptoms. Restlessness and affective symptoms emerged as the most central symptoms in the withdrawal networks. Minimal differences in the structure of the withdrawal networks emerged across time. Conclusions: The co-occurrence of withdrawal symptoms may result from interactions among symptoms of withdrawal rather than simply reflecting passive indicators of a latent disorder. Findings encourage greater consideration of individual withdrawal symptoms and their potential interactions and may be used to generate hypotheses that may be tested in future intensive longitudinal studies.",The Network Structure of Tobacco Withdrawal in a Community Sample of Smokers Treated with Nicotine Patch and Behavioral Counseling.

"SOX2 is a transcription factor that is essential for maintenance of pluripotency and has several conserved roles in early embryonic development. Heterozygous loss-of-function variants in SOX2 are identified in approximately 40% of all cases of bilateral anophthalmia/micropthalmia (A/M). Increasingly SOX2 mutation-positive patients without major eye findings, but with a range of other developmental disorders including autism, mild to moderate intellectual disability with or without structural brain changes, esophageal atresia, urogenital anomalies, and endocrinopathy are being reported, suggesting that the clinical phenotype associated with SOX2 loss is much broader than previously appreciated. In this report we describe six new cases, four of which carry novel pathogenic SOX2 variants. Four cases presented with bilateral anophthalmia in addition to extraocular involvement. Another individual presented with only unilateral anophthalmia. One individual did not have any eye findings but presented with a suprasellar teratoma in infancy and was found to have the recurrent c.70del20 mutation in SOX2 (c.70_89del, p.Asn24Argfs*65). This is this first time this tumor type has been reported in the context of a de novo SOX2 mutation. Notably, individuals with hypothalamic hamartomas and slow-growing hypothalamo-pituitary tumors have been reported previously, but it is still unclear how SOX2 loss contributes to their formation.",Extension of the mutational and clinical spectrum of SOX2 related disorders: Description of six new cases and a novel association with suprasellar teratoma.
"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Pediatricians are the first physicians to see a dysphonic child (DC), yet there are limited data on their proficiency in caring for them. The objective of this study was to understand how pediatricians' experience and their comfort in recognizing/diagnosing voice disorders affects their referral patterns and use of basic treatment options. STUDY DESIGN: Survey study. METHODS: A 13-question survey was sent to pediatricians in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's primary care network; 45/216 were returned. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student t test, linear/logistic regression model, Fisher exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Spearman's correlation test. RESULTS: Pediatricians practicing longer are more comfortable recognizing dysphonia (P = .0022). They are significantly more likely to refer a DC, even without subjective complaints of hoarseness by the family/patient or compounding medical issues. For each year in practice, the probability of referring increases by 1.55% (P = .0017). Pediatricians with a higher percentage of dysphonic children in their practice are more likely to trust their own perceptual recognition when deciding to refer (P = .0496). Nearly all pediatricians (40/45) would refer to a pediatric otolaryngologist. None would refer to a laryngologist or a voice therapist. No factors significantly affected treatment options. CONCLUSIONS: Veteran pediatricians feel more comfortable diagnosing a voice disorder and are more likely to refer a DC, regardless of patient/parent complaints or compounding factors. Pediatricians are most likely to refer to a pediatric otolaryngologist versus a voice specialist. These findings suggest that education of younger, less-experienced pediatricians about recognizing voice disorders and options for referral is needed. This may improve the overall care of the DC.

"Background: Stroke patients are known to be at risk of developing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective: To determine the overlap between anxiety, depression, and PTSD in patients after stroke and to determine the association between these disorders and quality of life, functional status, healthcare utilization, and return to work. Methods: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted to assess for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and health-related outcomes 6-12 months after first ischemic stroke in patients without prior psychiatric disease at a single stroke center. Results: Of 352 eligible subjects, 55 (16%) completed surveys. Seven subjects (13%) met criteria for probable anxiety, 6 (11%) for PTSD, and 11 for depression (20%). Of the 13 subjects (24%) who met criteria for any of these disorders, 6 (46%) met criteria for more than one, and 5 (39%) met criteria for all three. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, including stroke severity or neurologic symptoms, between those with or without any of these disorders. Those who had any of these disorders were less likely to be independent in their activities of daily living (ADLs) (54 vs. 95%, p < 0.001) and reported significantly worse quality of life (score of 0-100, median score of 50 vs. 80, p < 0.001) compared to those with none of these disorders. Conclusions: Anxiety, depression, and PTSD are common after stroke, have a high degree of co-occurrence, and are associated with worse outcomes, including quality of life and functional status.","Association Between Anxiety, Depression, and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and Outcomes After Ischemic Stroke."
"Congestive heart failure (CHF) is defined as a cardiac dysfunction leading to low cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion. Intravenous positive inotropes are used to increase myocardial contractility in hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and used most commonly for inotropic effect. The well-known PROMISE study investigated the effects of milrinone on mortality in patients with severe CHF, and concluded that long-term therapy with milrinone increased morbidity and mortality among patients with advanced CHF. Previous studies have suggested that phosphodiesterase inhibitors can have potential effects on inflammatory pathways. Hence, we hypothesized that milrinone may alter inflammatory gene expressions in cardiomyocytes, thus leading to adverse clinical outcomes. We used rat cardiomyocyte cell line H9C2 and studied the impact of exposing cardiomyocytes to milrinone (10 mumol/L) for 24 hours on inflammatory gene expressions. RNA extracted from cultured cardiomyocytes was used for whole rat genome gene expression assay (41,000 genes). The following changes in inflammatory response-related gene expressions were discovered. Genes with increased expressions included: THBS2 (+9.98), MMP2 (+3.47), DDIT3 (+2.39), and ADORA3 (+3.5). Genes with decreased expressions were: SPP1 (-5.28) and CD14 (-2.05). We found that the above mentioned gene expression changes seem to indicate that milrinone may hinder the inflammatory process which may potentially lead to adverse clinical outcomes. However, further in vivo and clinical investigations will be needed to illustrate the clinical relevance of these gene expression changes induced by milrinone.",Effects of milrinone on inflammatory response-related gene expressions in cultured rat cardiomyocytes.

"Much of the mammalian skeleton originates from a cartilage template eventually replaced by bone via endochondral ossification. Despite much knowledge about growth factors and nuclear proteins in skeletal development, little is understood about the role of metabolic regulation. Here we report that genetic deletion of the glucose transporter Glut1 (Slc2a1), either before or after the onset of chondrogenesis in the limb, severely impairs chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, resulting in dramatic shortening of the limbs. The cartilage defects are reminiscent to those caused by deficiency in Bmp signaling. Importantly, deletion of Bmpr1a in chondrocytes markedly reduces Glut1 levels in vivo, whereas recombinant BMP2 increases Glut1 mRNA and protein levels, boosting glucose metabolism in primary chondrocytes. Biochemical studies identify a Bmp-mTORC1-Hif1a signaling cascade resulting in upregulation of Glut1 in chondrocytes. The results therefore uncover a hitherto unknown connection between Bmp signaling and glucose metabolism in the regulation of cartilage development.",Glucose metabolism induced by Bmp signaling is essential for murine skeletal development.

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in racial, ethnic, and sex representation at US medical schools across 16 specialties: internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, psychiatry, radiology, anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynecology, neurology, family practice, pathology, emergency medicine, orthopedic surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and dermatology. Using a novel, Census-derived statistical measure of diversity, the S-score, we quantified the degree of underrepresentation for racial minority groups and female faculty by rank for assistant, associate, and full professors from 1990-2016. METHODS: This longitudinal study of faculty diversity uses data obtained from the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Roster from US allopathic medical schools. The proportion of professors of racial minority groups and female faculty by rank was compared to the US population based on data from the US Census Bureau. The Roster includes data on 52,939 clinical medical faculty in 1990, and 129,545 in 2016, at the assistant professor level or higher. The primary measure used in this study was the S-score, a measure of representation based on the probability of the observed frequency of faculty from a racial/ethnic group and sex, given the racial and ethnic distribution of the US. Pearson correlations and 95% confidence intervals for S-score with time were used to measure trends. RESULTS: Blacks and Hispanics showed statistically significant trends (p<0.05) towards increasing underrepresentation in most specialties and are more underrepresented in 2016 than in 1990 across all ranks and specialties analyzed, except for Black females in obstetrics & gynecology. White females were also underrepresented in many specialties and in a subset of specialties trended toward greater underrepresentation. CONCLUSIONS: Current efforts to improve faculty diversity are inadequate in generating an academic physician workforce that represents the diversity of the US. More aggressive measures for faculty recruitment, retention, and promotion are necessary to reach equity in academia and healthcare.",Declining racial and ethnic representation in clinical academic medicine: A longitudinal study of 16 US medical specialties.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inflammatory and/or infectious conditions affecting the heart and pericardium in children are primarily diagnosed via noninvasive imaging modalities. In addition, the use of multiple imaging modalities (multimodality imaging) is becoming increasingly common to assist in diagnosis, management, and prognosis. This review focuses on the use of noninvasive imaging in endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis, with emphasis placed on the use of echocardiography and cardiac MRI in these conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Echocardiography remains the most commonly employed imaging modality for all of the above diagnoses. However, echocardiography has several important limitations, foremost of which is a limited ability to characterize myocardial tissue abnormalities, such as inflammation and fibrosis. Quantitative assessment of cardiac output and valve function is also limited with echocardiography. Cardiac MRI is superior to echocardiography in these domains and provides useful complementary information. SUMMARY: Echocardiography and cardiac MRI play crucial roles in the diagnosis, management, and forecasting of prognosis in inflammatory and/or infectious conditions affecting the heart in children. New advances, particularly in MRI imaging, have allowed clinicians to provide more accurate diagnoses and information regarding prognosis.","Imaging the itis: endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis."

"BACKGROUND: Prior studies have consistently demonstrated that blacks have an approximate 2-fold higher incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) than whites; however, these analyses have lacked individual-level sociodemographic, medical comorbidity, and behavioral health data. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether racial differences in SCD incidence are attributable to differences in the prevalence of risk factors or rather to underlying susceptibility to fatal arrhythmias. METHODS: The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study is a prospective, population-based cohort of adults from across the United States. Associations between race and SCD defined per National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria were assessed. RESULTS: Among 22,507 participants (9,416 blacks and 13,091 whites) without a history of clinical cardiovascular disease, there were 174 SCD events (67 whites and 107 blacks) over a median follow-up of 6.1 years (interquartile range: 4.6 to 7.3 years). The age-adjusted SCD incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years) was higher in blacks (1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 2.2) compared with whites (0.7; 95% CI: 0.6 to 0.9), with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 2.35; 95% CI: 1.74 to 3.20. The association of black race with SCD risk remained significant after adjustment for sociodemographics, comorbidities, behavioral measures of health, intervening cardiovascular events, and competing risks of non-SCD mortality (hazard ratio: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.39 to 2.77). CONCLUSIONS: In a large biracial population of adults without a history of cardiovascular disease, SCD rates were significantly higher in blacks as compared with whites. These racial differences were not fully explained by demographics, adverse socioeconomic measures, cardiovascular risk factors, and behavioral measures of health.",Differences in Risk of Sudden Cardiac Death Between Blacks and Whites.

"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with a steadily rising incidence and associated morbidity and mortality. Cirrhosis of the liver is presently the leading risk factor for developing HCC. Abdominal imaging, with or without alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) testing, every 6months is the current surveillance strategy for patients at risk. The available biomarkers for detecting this cancer at an early stage have inadequate sensitivity and specificity. METHODS: The Hepatocellular carcinoma Early Detection Strategy (HEDS) study, a multi-center initiative of the National Cancer Institutes' (NCI) Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), launched an effort to establish what has become the nation's largest comprehensive biorepository and database on patients at high risk of developing HCC. The cohort has been developed in seven clinical centers across the USA. Subjects are enrolled for a five-year period involving data and specimen collection every six months in accordance with standard surveillance for HCC. Extensive clinical data are collected and specimens are stored at a central repository. RESULTS: The database and biorepository contain longitudinally collected clinical data and serum and plasma samples from 1482 participants with cirrhosis and without evidence of HCC at baseline. Fifty-six percent are male, 85% Caucasian, 30% have a history of chronic HCV and 71% have compensated cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: The HEDS cohort provides opportunities for the continued study of the incidence and course of HCC in a comprehensively followed population of patients at high risk for this malignancy. Further, the EDRN biorepository provides a distinct opportunity for the development of novel biomarkers.

"BACKGROUND: The long-term impact of abdominally based free flap breast reconstruction is incompletely understood. The aim of this study is to provide long-term, subjective and objective health data on abdominally based free flap breast reconstruction patients, with specific attention to the effects of laterality, flap type, and obesity. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in this prospective study between 2005 and 2010 and completed preoperative, early (<1 year), and long-term (5 to 10 years) evaluations. Objective examination included an assessment of upper and lower abdominal function and a functional independence measure. Patient-reported outcomes included the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and the BREAST-Q abdominal well-being module. Scores were compared by laterality (unilateral versus bilateral), flap type (muscle-sparing free transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous versus deep inferior epigastric artery perforator), and presence of obesity. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were included, with an average 8.1-year follow-up. Overall, 78.8 percent of patients had stable or improved scores across the upper and lower abdominal function and functional independence measures, and minimal objective differences across flap laterality or types were observed. Postoperative scores improved for 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey physical health (p < 0.001) and mental health (p < 0.001), and did not differ based on laterality or flap type. Obesity negatively impacted physical health (p = 0.002) and mental health (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Abdominally based autologous breast reconstruction is associated with significant improvements in long-term quality of life across key domains of physical and mental health with little functional impairment and no long-term differences across flap type or laterality. Obese patients, however, may be at risk for subjective physical and mental health impairment, perhaps unrelated to the surgery itself.",Function and Strength after Free Abdominally Based Breast Reconstruction: A 10-Year Follow-Up.

"BACKGROUND: Concern over potential neurotoxicity of anesthetics has led to growing interest in prospective clinical trials using potentially less toxic anesthetic regimens, especially for prolonged anesthesia in infants. Preclinical studies suggest that dexmedetomidine may have a reduced neurotoxic profile compared to other conventional anesthetic regimens; however, coadministration with either anesthetic drugs (eg, remifentanil) and/or regional blockade is required to achieve adequate anesthesia for surgery. The feasibility of this pharmacological approach is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of a remifentanil/dexmedetomidine/neuraxial block technique in infants scheduled for surgery lasting longer than 2 hours. METHODS: Sixty infants (age 1-12 months) were enrolled at seven centers over 18 months. A caudal local anesthetic block was placed after induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane. Next, an infusion of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil commenced, and the sevoflurane was discontinued. Three different protocols with escalating doses of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil were used. RESULTS: One infant was excluded due to a protocol violation and consent was withdrawn prior to anesthesia in another. The caudal block was unsuccessful in two infants. Of the 56 infants who completed the protocol, 45 (80%) had at least one episode of hypertension (mean arterial pressure >80 mm Hg) and/or movement that required adjusting the anesthesia regimen. In the majority of these cases, the remifentanil and/or dexmedetomidine doses were increased although six infants required rescue 0.3% sevoflurane and one required a propofol bolus. Ten infants had at least one episode of mild hypotension (mean arterial pressure 40-50 mm Hg) and four had at least one episode of moderate hypotension (mean arterial pressure <40 mm Hg). CONCLUSION: A dexmedetomidine/remifentanil neuraxial anesthetic regimen was effective in 87.5% of infants. These findings can be used as a foundation for designing larger trials that assess alternative anesthetic regimens for anesthetic neurotoxicity in infants.",An open label pilot study of a dexmedetomidine-remifentanil-caudal anesthetic for infant lower abdominal/lower extremity surgery: The T REX pilot study.
"Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a major HDAC, whose enzymatic activity is targeted by small molecule inhibitors for treating a variety of conditions. However, its enzymatic activity is largely dispensable for its function in embryonic development and hepatic lipid metabolism. HDAC3 plays a pivotal role in regulating muscle fuel metabolism and contractile function. Here, we address whether these muscular functions of HDAC3 require its enzymatic activity. By mutating the NCoR/SMRT corepressors in a knock-in mouse model named NS-DADm, we ablated the enzymatic activity of HDAC3 without affecting its protein levels. Compared to the control mice, skeletal muscles from NS-DADm mice showed lower force generation, enhanced fatigue resistance, enhanced fatty acid oxidation, reduced glucose uptake during exercise, upregulated expression of metabolic genes involved in branched-chain amino acids catabolism, and reduced muscle mass during aging, without changes in the muscle fiber-type composition or mitochondrial protein content. These muscular phenotypes are similar to those observed in the HDAC3-depleted skeletal muscles, which demonstrates that, unlike that in the liver or embryonic development, the metabolic function of HDAC3 in skeletal muscles requires its enzymatic activity. These results suggest that drugs specifically targeting HDAC3 enzyme activity could be developed and tested to modulate muscle energy metabolism and exercise performance.",The HDAC3 enzymatic activity regulates skeletal muscle fuel metabolism.
"Identifying mosquito species is a fundamental step in risk assessment and implementation of preventative strategies. Moreover, Culex pipiens is the most widespread mosquito vector in several regions of Iran and is the main vector for transmission of West Nile virus (WNV). Mosquitoes were collected at 14 sites in northern regions of Iran in 2015 and 2016. A subset of mosquito specimens was selected for identification confirmation using a DNA-barcoding technique. Construction of a phylogenetic tree showed clustering of mosquito sequences into three main genera: Aedes, Anopheles and Culex with individuals of a single species clustered closely together, regardless of where and when they were collected. Cx. pipiens complex and Cx. torrentium were identified and differentiated using multiplex real-time PCR targeting the gene locus for acetylcholinesterase 2 (ace2) to discriminate between Cx. pipiens pipiens and Cx. torrentium. The CQ11 microsatellite locus was used for discrimination between Cpp. biotypes. The predominant mosquito species in investigated regions were Cx. pipiens pipiens biotype pipiens, but we also detected Culex pipiens pipiens biotype molestus and hybrids of the two pipiens biotypes, as well as Cx. torrentium. The results of this study represent the first certain evidence of the presence of Cx. pipiens pipiens biotype molestus and hybrids between pipiens and molestus forms, and Cx. torrentium in Iran through a molecular identification approach. This report of a potentially important bridge vector for WNV might have key influence in the risk projections for WNV in Iran.",DNA barcodes corroborating identification of mosquito species and multiplex real-time PCR differentiating Culex pipiens complex and Culex torrentium in Iran.

"The centrosomal protein gamma-tubulin is part of the cytoplasmic gamma-tubulin small (gamma-TuSCs) and large complexes (gamma-TuRCs). Both, molecular and cellular evidence indicate that gamma-tubulin plays a central role in microtubule nucleation and mitotic spindle formation. However, the molecular mechanisms of complex formation and subsequent biological roles in animal development remain unclear. Here, we used gamma-tubulin gene knockdown in the zebrafish early embryo model to gain insights into its activity and cellular contribution during vertebrate embryogenesis. gamma-Tubulin loss-of-function impaired gamma-TuSC formation, impacting the microtubule nucleation rate in vitro. Moreover, decreased gamma-tubulin synthesis caused dramatic defects in nuclear dynamics and cell cycle progression, leading to developmental arrest at the mid-gastrula stage. At the subcellular level, microtubule organization and function were altered, affecting chromosome segregation and triggering cell proliferation arrest and apoptosis. Our results suggest that de novo translated gamma-tubulin participates in gamma-TuSC formation required for early animal development. Importantly, formation of this complex is essential for both centrosome assembly and function, and cell proliferation. Thus, gamma-TuSC integrity appears to be critical for cell cycle progression, and concomitantly, for coordinating the many distinct activities carried out by the early embryo. Our findings identify a novel role for gamma-TuSC in the regulation of early vertebrate embryogenesis, providing molecular and biochemical starting points for future in depth studies of gamma-tubulin functionality and its specific role in development.",gamma-Tubulin small complex formation is essential for early zebrafish embryogenesis.
"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) studies rare genetic disorders not only to achieve diagnoses, but to understand human biology. To ascertain the contribution of protein glycosylation to rare diseases, the NIH UDP used mass spectrometry to agnostically identify abnormalities of N-linked and O-linked glycans in plasma and free oligosaccharides in the urine of 207 patients. 60% of UDP patients had a glycome profile that deviated from control values in at least 1 fluid. Additional evaluation of the fibroblast glycome in 66 patients with abnormalities in plasma and/or urine revealed a consistent glycome phenotype in 83% of these cases. Many of these patients may have secondary glycosylation defects, since it is unlikely that they all have congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). In fact, whole exome sequencing revealed only a few patients with CDGs, along with several others having disorders indirectly altering glycosylation. In summary, we describe a biochemical phenotyping screen to identify defects in protein glycosylation that can elucidate mechanisms of disease among NIH UDP patients.",Glycomics in rare diseases: from diagnosis to mechanism.
"Importance: Addressing the social determinants of health has been difficult for health systems to operationalize. Objective: To assess a standardized intervention, Individualized Management for Patient-Centered Targets (IMPaCT), delivered by community health workers (CHWs) across 3 health systems. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 2-armed, single-blind, multicenter randomized clinical trial recruited patients from 3 primary care facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between January 28, 2015, and March 28, 2016. Patients who resided in a high-poverty zip code, were uninsured or publicly insured, and who had a diagnosis for 2 or more chronic diseases were recruited, and patients were randomized to either the CHW intervention or the control arm (goal setting only). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 and 9 months after enrollment. Data were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach from June 2017 to March 2018. Intervention: Participants set a chronic disease management goal with their primary care physician; those randomized to the CHW intervention received 6 months of tailored support. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in self-rated physical health. The secondary outcomes were self-rated mental health, chronic disease control, patient activation, patient-reported quality of primary care, and all-cause hospitalization. Results: Of the 592 participants, 370 (62.5%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 52.6 (11.1) years. Participants in both arms had similar improvements in self-rated physical health (mean [SD], 1.8 [11.2] vs 1.6 [9.9]; P = .89). Patients in the intervention group were more likely to report the highest quality of care (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.4; risk difference [RD], 0.12; P < .001) and spent fewer total days in the hospital at 6 months (155 days vs 345 days; absolute event rate reduction, 69%) and 9 months (300 days vs 471 days; absolute event rate reduction, 65%). This reduction was driven by a shorter average length of stay (difference, -3.1 days; 95% CI, -6.33 to 0.22; P = .06) and a lower mean number of hospitalizations (difference, -0.3; 95% CI, -0.6 to 0.0; P = .07) among patients who were hospitalized. Patients in the intervention group had a lower odds of repeat hospitalizations (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; RD, -0.24; P = .02), including 30-day readmissions (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; RD, -0.17; P = .04). Conclusions and Relevance: A standardized intervention did not improve self-rated health but did improve the patient-perceived quality of care while reducing hospitalizations, suggesting that health systems may use a standardized intervention to address the social determinants of health.

"The highly reproducible inheritance of chromosomes during mitosis in mammalian cells involves nuclear envelope breakdown, increased chromatin compaction, loss of long-range intrachromosomal interactions, loss of enhancer-promoter proximity, displacement of many transcription regulators from the chromatin and a marked decrease in RNA synthesis. Despite these dramatic changes in the mother cell, daughter cells are able to faithfully re-establish the parental chromatin and gene expression features characteristic of the cell type. Pioneering studies of mitotic chromatin signatures showed that despite global repression of transcription, the Hsp70 gene promoter retains an open chromatin conformation, which was proposed to allow the reactivation of the Hsp70 gene upon completion of mitosis - a phenomenon termed mitotic bookmarking. It was later shown that various cell-type-specific transcription factors, such as GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA1) in erythroblasts and forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) in hepatocytes, remain bound at a subset of their interphase binding sites in mitosis. Such bookmarking transcription factors remain on chromosomes in mitosis and have been shown to enable a subset of genes to be reactivated in a timely fashion upon mitotic exit. In addition, sensitive new methods to measure transcription revealed that mitotic cells retain residual transcription at a large number of genes. Furthermore, genes recover their interphase level of transcription in distinct waves. Thus, gene expression is precisely regulated as cells pass through mitosis to ensure faithful propagation of cell identity and function through cellular generations.",A changing paradigm of transcriptional memory propagation through mitosis.

"Purpose: The need for community-viable, evidence-based intervention strategies for toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a national priority. The purpose of this research forum article is to identify gaps in intervention research and needs in community practice for toddlers with ASD, incorporate published findings from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Early Social Interaction (ESI) model (Wetherby et al., 2014) to illustrate community-based intervention, report new findings on child active engagement from the ESI RCT, and offer solutions to bridge the research-to-community practice gap. Method: Research findings were reviewed to identify gaps in the evidence base for toddlers with ASD. Published and new findings from the multisite ESI RCT compared the effects of two different ESI conditions for 82 toddlers with ASD to teach parents how to support active engagement in natural environments. Results: The RCT of the ESI model was the only parent-implemented intervention that reported differential treatment effects on standardized measures of child outcomes, including social communication, developmental level, and adaptive behavior. A new measure of active engagement in the natural environment was found to be sensitive to change in 3 months for young toddlers with ASD and to predict outcomes on the standardized measures of child outcomes. Strategies for utilizing the Autism Navigator collection of web-based courses and tools using extensive video footage for families and professional development are offered for scaling up in community settings to change developmental trajectories of toddlers with ASD. Conclusions: Current health care and education systems are challenged to provide intervention of adequate intensity for toddlers with ASD. The use of innovative technology can increase acceleration of access to evidence-based early intervention for toddlers with ASD that addresses health disparities, enables immediate response as soon as ASD is suspected, and rapidly bridges the research-to-practice gap.",Changing Developmental Trajectories of Toddlers With Autism Spectrum Disorder: Strategies for Bridging Research to Community Practice.
"BACKGROUND:: Upper extremity (UE) impairment is common with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). OBJECTIVE:: This exploratory analysis examined the effects of ocrelizumab on confirmed progression (CP) and confirmed improvement (CI) in UE impairment in patients from ORATORIO. METHODS:: Patients with PPMS received ocrelizumab 600 mg or placebo every 24 weeks for 120 weeks. The Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) was administered at baseline (BL) and every 12 weeks thereafter. Prespecified exploratory endpoints included change in 9HPT time and proportion of patients with CP of 20% in 9HPT. Analysis populations included intention-to-treat (ITT) patients and subgroups stratified by BL 9HPT time and Expanded Disability Status Scale. Post hoc analyses included the proportion of patients achieving more severe thresholds of CP and the proportion achieving CI in 9HPT. RESULTS:: Among ITT patients, ocrelizumab significantly reduced the change in 9HPT time over 120 weeks, the risk of CP of 20% in 9HPT time for both hands and the risk of more severe 9HPT progression versus placebo. Numerical trends also favoured ocrelizumab versus placebo with respect to achieving CI. Consistent directional trends were observed in subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION:: Ocrelizumab reduces the risk of UE disability progression and may increase the possibility of improvement versus placebo in PPMS.",Ocrelizumab reduces progression of upper extremity impairment in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis: Findings from the phase III randomized ORATORIO trial.
"PURPOSE: To facilitate the initiation of observational studies on late effects of proton therapy in pediatric patients, we report on current patterns of proton therapy use worldwide in patients aged less than 22years. MATERIALS & METHODS: Fifty-four proton centers treating pediatric patients in 2016 in 11 countries were invited to respond to a survey about the number of patients treated during that year by age group, intent of treatment, delivery technique and tumor types. RESULTS: Among the 40 participating centers (participation rate: 74%), a total of 1,860 patients were treated in 2016 (North America: 1205, Europe: 432, Asia: 223). The numbers of patients per center ranged from 1 to 206 (median: 29). Twenty-four percent of the patients were <5years of age, and 50% <10years. More than 30 pediatric tumor types were identified, mainly treated with curative intent: 48% were CNS, 25% extra-cranial sarcomas, 7% neuroblastoma, and 5% hematopoietic tumors. About half of the patients were treated with pencil beam scanning. Treatment patterns were broadly similar across the three continents. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this survey provides the first worldwide assessment of proton therapy use for pediatric cancer management. Since previous estimates in the United States and Europe, CNS tumors remain the cancer types most commonly treated with protons in 2016. However, the proportion of extra-cranial tumors is growing worldwide. The typically low numbers of patients treated in each center indicate the need for international research collaborations to assess long-term outcomes of proton therapy in pediatric patients.",Patterns of proton therapy use in pediatric cancer management in 2016: An international survey.
"OBJECTIVE: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are active in cancer cells that have impaired repair of DNA by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Strategies that disrupt HR may sensitize HR-proficient tumors to PARP inhibition. As a component of the core cell cycle machinery, cyclin D1 has unexpected function in DNA repair, suggesting that targeting cyclin D1 may represent a plausible strategy for expanding the utility of PARPi in ovarian cancer. METHODS: BRCA1 wildtype ovarian cancer cells (A2780 and SKOV3) were treated with a combination of CCND1 siRNA and olaparib in vitro. Cell viability was assessed by MTT. The effects of the combined treatment on DNA damage repair and cell cycle progression were examined to dissect molecular mechanisms. In vivo studies were performed in an orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse model. Animals were treated with a combination of lentivirus-mediated CCND1 shRNA and olaparib or olaparib plus scrambled shRNA. Molecular downstream effects were examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Silencing of cyclin D1 sensitized ovarian cancer cells to olaparib through interfering with RAD51 accumulation and inducing cell cycle G0/G1 arrest. Treatment of lentivirus-mediated CCND1-shRNA in nude mice statistically significantly augmented the olaparib response (mean tumor weight+/-SD, CCND1-shRNA plus olaparib vs scrambled shRNA plus olaparib: 0.172+/-0.070g vs 0.324+/-0.044g, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Silencing of cyclin D1 combined with olaparib may lead to substantial benefit for ovarian cancer management by mimicking a BRCAness phenotype, and induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.","Cyclin D1 silencing impairs DNA double strand break repair, sensitizes BRCA1 wildtype ovarian cancer cells to olaparib."
"OBJECTIVE: Poor total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) hemodynamics have been hypothesized to be associated with long-term complications in Fontan patients. Image-based Fontan surgical planning has shown great potential as a clinical tool because it can pre-operatively evaluate patient-specific hemodynamics. Current surgical planning paradigms commonly utilize cardiac-gated phase contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to acquire vessel flows. These acquisitions are often taken under breath-held (BH) conditions and ignore the effect of respiration on blood flow waveforms. This study investigates the effect of respiration-driven flow waveforms on patient-specific hemodynamics using real-time MR acquisitions. METHODS: Patient-specific TCPCs were reconstructed from cardiovascular MR images. Real-time phase contrast MR images were acquired under both free-breathing (FB) and breath-held conditions for 9 patients. Numerical simulations were employed to assess flow structures and hemodynamics used in Fontan surgical planning including hepatic flow distribution (HFD) and indexed power loss (iPL), which were then compared between FB and BH conditions. RESULTS: Differences in TCPC flow structures between FB and BH conditions were observed throughout the respiratory cycle. However, the average differences (BH - FB values for each patient, which are then averaged) in iPL and HFD between these conditions were 0.002+/-0.011 (p=0.40) and 1+/-3% (p=0.28), respectively, indicating no significant difference in clinically important hemodynamic metrics. CONCLUSIONS: Respiration affects blood flow waveforms and flow structures, but might not significantly influence the values of iPL or HFD. Therefore, breath-held MR acquisition can be adequate for Fontan surgical planning when focusing on iPL and HFD.",The effect of respiration-driven flow waveforms on hemodynamic metrics used in Fontan surgical planning.
"BACKGROUND: A plethora of reactive cellular responses emerge immediately after a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and may influence the patient's outcomes. We investigated whether serum concentrations of neuron-specific enolase, interleukin-6, glial-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophic growth factor reflect the acute-phase responses to different etiologies of SCI and may serve as predictive biomarkers of neurologic and functional outcomes. METHODS: Fifty-two patients were admitted to the intensive care unit after SCI due to traffic accidents, falls, and firearm wounds and had blood samples collected within 48 hours and 7 days after SCI. Thirty-six healthy subjects with no history of SCI were included as controls. Neurologic and functional status was evaluated on the basis of American Spinal Injury Association and Functional Independence Measure scores over a period of 48 hours and 6 months after SCI. RESULTS: Serum NSE increased significantly 48 hours and 7 days after SCI compared with controls, while interleukin-6 increased only at 48 hours. In contrast, the neurotrophic growth factor level significantly decreased 48 hours and 7 days after SCI. Serum glial-derived neurotrophic factor level did not differ from control at any time point. Also, there was no significant difference in biomarker concentrations between the etiologies of SCI or the level of spinal injury. There were no correlations between biomarker levels at 48 hours with neurologic or functional outcomes 7 days and 6 months after SCI. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest expansive axonal damage coupled with an acute proinflammatory response after SCI. However, in our study biomarker concentration did not correlate with short- or long-term prognosis, such as survival rate or sensory and motor function.",Serum Biomarkers and Clinical Outcomes in Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: Prospective Cohort Study.
"Microglia represent 5-10% of cells in the central nervous system and contribute to the development, homeostasis, injury, and repair of neural tissues. As the tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system, microglia execute core innate immune functions such as detection of pathogens/damage, cytokine secretion, and phagocytosis. However, additional properties that are specific to microglia and their neural environment are beginning to be appreciated. This article describes approaches for purification of microglia by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using microglia-specific surface markers and for enrichment of microglia by magnetic sorting and immunopanning. Detailed information about culturing primary microglia at various developmental stages is also provided.

"Cardiovascular (CV)- and lifestyle-associated risk factors (RFs) are increasingly recognized as important for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Beyond the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), comparatively little is known about whether CV-associated genes also increase risk for AD. Using large genome-wide association studies and validated tools to quantify genetic overlap, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with AD and one or more CV-associated RFs, namely body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), waist hip ratio (WHR), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In fold enrichment plots, we observed robust genetic enrichment in AD as a function of plasma lipids (TG, TC, LDL, and HDL); we found minimal AD genetic enrichment conditional on BMI, T2D, CAD, and WHR. Beyond APOE, at conjunction FDR < 0.05 we identified 90 SNPs on 19 different chromosomes that were jointly associated with AD and CV-associated outcomes. In meta-analyses across three independent cohorts, we found four novel loci within MBLAC1 (chromosome 7, meta-p = 1.44 x 10(-9)), MINK1 (chromosome 17, meta-p = 1.98 x 10(-7)) and two chromosome 11 SNPs within the MTCH2/SPI1 region (closest gene = DDB2, meta-p = 7.01 x 10(-7) and closest gene = MYBPC3, meta-p = 5.62 x 10(-8)). In a large 'AD-by-proxy' cohort from the UK Biobank, we replicated three of the four novel AD/CV pleiotropic SNPs, namely variants within MINK1, MBLAC1, and DDB2. Expression of MBLAC1, SPI1, MINK1 and DDB2 was differentially altered within postmortem AD brains. Beyond APOE, we show that the polygenic component of AD is enriched for lipid-associated RFs. We pinpoint a subset of cardiovascular-associated genes that strongly increase the risk for AD. Our collective findings support a disease model in which cardiovascular biology is integral to the development of clinical AD in a subset of individuals.",Dissecting the genetic relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and Alzheimer's disease.
"Individuals with psychiatric disabilities who are involved in the criminal justice system face a number of challenges to community integration upon release. There is a critical need to develop and evaluate interventions for these individuals that connect them to the community by enhancing naturalistic social connections and helping them to participate meaningfully in valued roles. The purposes of this article are to describe, provide a theoretical rationale, and propose a conceptual model for the use of a particular restorative justice model, circles of support and accountability, to meet this need. We describe the principles of restorative justice (repairing harm, stakeholder involvement, and the transformation of community and governmental roles and relationships) and how these map on to elements of the circles intervention. These elements include a focus on community participation, positive social support, democratic decision making, collective ownership of crime problems, and connection to community-based resources. We then suggest how changes in identity transformation, moral development and motivation, and collective efficacy might mediate relationships between these intervention elements and community integration outcomes.

"Protein kinase A, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent enzyme, normally exists within mammalian cells; however, in cancer cells, it can leak out and be found in the serum. Extracellular cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (ECPKA) has been determined to increase in the serum of cancer-bearing dogs. However, there have been no reports in the veterinary literature on serum ECPKA autoantibody (ECPKA-Ab) expression in dogs with cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate ECPKA-Ab and C-reactive protein (CRP) as serum biomarkers for cancer in dogs. ECPKA-Ab and CRP levels were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum samples from dogs with malignant tumours (n = 167), benign tumours (n = 42), or non-tumour disease (n = 155) and from healthy control dogs (n = 123). ECPKA-Ab and CRP levels were significantly higher in the dogs with malignant tumours than in those with benign tumours or non-tumour diseases, as well as in the healthy controls (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). There was a significant positive correlation between the neoplastic index, which was developed using ECPKA-Ab and CRP levels, and the presence of cancer in dogs (P < 0.001); the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was estimated to be >0.85 (P < 0.001). In conclusion, ECPKA-Ab is a potential serum biomarker for a broad spectrum of cancers.

"Background: Tumorigenesis is driven by stem cell (SC) overpopulation. Because ALDH is both a marker for SCs in many tissues and a key enzyme in retinoid acid (RA) signaling, we studied RA signaling in normal and malignant colonic SCs. Hypothesis: RA signaling regulates growth and differentiation of ALDH+ colonic SCs; dysregulation of RA signaling contributes to SC overpopulation and colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Methods: We analyzed normal and malignant colonic tissues and CRC cell lines to see if retinoid receptors (RXR & RAR) are exclusively expressed in ALDH+ SCs, and if RA signaling changes during CRC development. We determined whether RA signaling regulates cancer SC (CSC) proliferation, differentiation, sphere formation, and population size. Results: RXR & RAR were expressed in ALDH+ colonic SCs, but not in MCM2+ proliferative cells. Western blotting/immunostaining of CRCs revealed that RA signaling components become overexpressed in parallel with ALDH overexpression, which coincides with the known overpopulation of ALDH+ SCs that occurs during, and drives, CRC development. Treatment of SCs with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) decreased proliferation, sphere formation and ALDH+ SC population size, and induced differentiation along the neuroendocrine cell (NEC) lineage. Conclusions: Retinoid signaling, by regulating ALDH+ colonic CSCs, decreases SC proliferation, sphere formation, and population size, and increases SC differentiation to NECs. Dysregulation of RA signaling in colonic SCs likely contributes to overpopulation of ALDH+ SCs and CRC growth. Implications: That retinoid receptors RXR and RAR are selectively expressed in ALDH+ SCs indicates RA signaling mainly occurs via ALDH+ SCs, which provides a mechanism to selectively target CSCs.",The anti-cancer effect of retinoic acid signaling in CRC occurs via decreased growth of ALDH+ colon cancer stem cells and increased differentiation of stem cells.

"Vector-borne diseases commonly emerge in urban landscapes, and Gaussian field models can be used to create risk maps of vector presence across a large environment. However, these models do not account for the possibility that streets function as permeable barriers for insect vectors. We describe a methodology to transform spatial point data to incorporate permeable barriers, by distorting the map to widen streets, with one additional parameter. We use Gaussian field models to estimate this additional parameter, and develop risk maps incorporating streets as permeable barriers. We demonstrate our method on simulated datasets and apply it to data on Triatoma infestans, a vector of Chagas disease in Arequipa, Peru. We found that the transformed landscape that best fit the observed pattern of Triatoma infestans infestation, approximately doubled the true Euclidean distance between neighboring houses on different city blocks. Our findings may better guide control of re-emergent insect populations.",Risk maps for cities: Incorporating streets into geostatistical models.
"BACKGROUND: Children who were born prematurely, those with a very low birthweight, or who have survived the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are at risk for the development of hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and thus require blood pressure screening less than 3 years of age, per American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2004 and 2017 guidelines. METHODS: We reviewed the practice patterns of a large pediatric health care system and assessed adherence to the AAP clinical practice guidelines on blood pressure measurements in children less than 3 years of age for hypertension and CKD with the following risk factors: prematurity, very low birthweight, and a neonatal intensive care setting encounter. This retrospective chart review included a total of 9965 patients with a median gestational age of 34 weeks. RESULTS: Overall, 38% of patients had at least one blood pressure measured less than 3 years of age. Primary care accounted for 41% of all outpatient encounters and 4% of all blood pressure measurements. Surgical specialties (i.e., ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and orthopedics) accounted for many non-primary care visits and were less likely than medical specialties (i.e., cardiology and nephrology) to obtain a blood pressure measurement (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study of a large healthcare system's practice revealed a lack of basic screening for hypertension in a population known to be at risk for hypertension and CKD.",Poor adherence to early childhood blood pressure measurement guidelines in a large pediatric healthcare system.
"There is growing interest in Family Navigation as an approach to improving access to care for children with autism spectrum disorder, yet little data exist on the implementation of Family Navigation. The aim of this study was to identify potential failures in implementing Family Navigation for children with autism spectrum disorder, using a failure modes and effects analysis. This mixed-methods study was set within a randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of Family Navigation in reducing the time from screening to diagnosis and treatment for autism spectrum disorder across three states. Using standard failure modes and effects analysis methodology, experts in Family Navigation for autism spectrum disorder (n = 9) rated potential failures in implementation on a 10-point scale in three categories: likelihood of the failure occurring, likelihood of not detecting the failure, and severity of failure. Ratings were then used to create a risk priority number for each failure. The failure modes and effects analysis detected five areas for potential ""high priority"" failures in implementation: (1) setting up community-based services, (2) initial family meeting, (3) training, (4) fidelity monitoring, and (5) attending testing appointments. Reasons for failure included families not receptive, scheduling, and insufficient training time. The process with the highest risk profile was ""setting up community-based services."" Failure in ""attending testing appointment"" was rated as the most severe potential failure.

"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the feasibility of an application for measuring the frequency of consumption of high-fat foods and compared this application with standard methods. METHODS: Twenty-six females and thirty six males aged 20(-)40 were enrolled in Poland. Participants completed the Block Screening Questionnaire for Fat Intake (BSQF; Q1) and a second questionnaire (Q2) with additional high-fat foods. The participants were then monitored for ten days in a real-time manner using a smartphone application that employed the same lists of food as Q2. RESULTS: Most subjects (84%) gave replies to at least three prompts on at least 5 days. The results from Q1 and the application were correlated (r = 0.42, p < 0.001). Energy intake and the frequency of consumption of high-fat foods were correlated in the overweight/obese group (r = 0.83, p < 0.001). The mean differences between Q2 and the app were similar in both groups but the agreement limits were wider in the overweight/obese group than in the normal weight group.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a large, multisite clinical trial of gabapentin enacarbil extended-release (GE-XR) (HORIZANT((R)) ), a gabapentin prodrug formulation, to determine its safety and efficacy in treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). METHODS: Men and women (n = 346) who met DSM-5 criteria for at least moderate AUD were recruited across 10 U.S. clinical sites. Participants received double-blind GE-XR (600 mg twice a day) or placebo and a computerized behavioral intervention (Take Control) for 6 months. Efficacy analyses were prespecified for the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. RESULTS: The GE-XR and placebo groups did not differ significantly on the primary outcome measure, percentage of subjects with no heavy drinking days (28.3 vs. 21.5, respectively, p = 0.157). Similarly, no clinical benefit was found for other drinking measures (percent subjects abstinent, percent days abstinent, percent heavy drinking days, drinks per week, drinks per drinking day), alcohol craving, alcohol-related consequences, sleep problems, smoking, and depression/anxiety symptoms. Common side-effects were fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence. A population pharmacokinetics analysis revealed that patients had lower gabapentin exposure levels compared with those in other studies using a similar dose but for other indications. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, GE-XR at 600 mg twice a day did not reduce alcohol consumption or craving in individuals with AUD. It is possible that, unlike the IR formulation of gabapentin, which showed efficacy in smaller Phase 2 trials at a higher dose, GE-XR is not effective in treating AUD, at least not at doses approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating other medical conditions.","Gabapentin Enacarbil Extended-Release for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multisite Trial Assessing Efficacy and Safety."
"N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most prevalent internal RNA modification on mammalian messenger RNAs, regulates the fates and functions of modified transcripts through m(6)A-specific binding proteins(1-5). In the nervous system, m(6)A is abundant and modulates various neural functions(6-11). Whereas m(6)A marks groups of mRNAs for coordinated degradation in various physiological processes(12-15), the relevance of m(6)A for mRNA translation in vivo remains largely unknown. Here we show that, through its binding protein YTHDF1, m(6)A promotes protein translation of target transcripts in response to neuronal stimuli in the adult mouse hippocampus, thereby facilitating learning and memory. Mice with genetic deletion of Ythdf1 show learning and memory defects as well as impaired hippocampal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation. Re-expression of YTHDF1 in the hippocampus of adult Ythdf1-knockout mice rescues the behavioural and synaptic defects, whereas hippocampus-specific acute knockdown of Ythdf1 or Mettl3, which encodes the catalytic component of the m(6)A methyltransferase complex, recapitulates the hippocampal deficiency. Transcriptome-wide mapping of YTHDF1-binding sites and m(6)A sites on hippocampal mRNAs identified key neuronal genes. Nascent protein labelling and tether reporter assays in hippocampal neurons showed that YTHDF1 enhances protein synthesis in a neuronal-stimulus-dependent manner. In summary, YTHDF1 facilitates translation of m(6)A-methylated neuronal mRNAs in response to neuronal stimulation, and this process contributes to learning and memory.",m(6)A facilitates hippocampus-dependent learning and memory through YTHDF1.
"Vulnerability to depression is increased across the menopause transition and in the early years after the final menstrual period. Clinicians should systematically screen women in this age group; if depressive symptoms or disorder are present, treatment of depression should be initiated. Potential treatments include antidepressants for moderate to severe symptoms, psychotherapy to target psychological and interpersonal factors, and hormone therapy for women with first-onset major depressive disorder or elevated depressive symptoms and at low risk for adverse effects. Behavioral interventions can improve physical activity and sleep patterns.","Depression During and After the Perimenopause: Impact of Hormones, Genetics, and Environmental Determinants of Disease."

"BACKGROUND:: Concussions in American football remain a high priority of sports injury prevention programs. Detailed video review provides important information on causation, the outcomes of rule changes, and guidance on future injury prevention strategies. PURPOSE:: Documentation of concussions sustained in National Football League games played during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 seasons, including consideration of video views unavailable to the public. STUDY DESIGN:: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS:: All reported concussions were reviewed with all available video footage. Standardized terminology and associated definitions were developed to describe and categorize the details of each concussion. RESULTS:: Cornerbacks sustained the most concussions, followed by wide receivers, then linebackers and offensive linemen. Half (50%) of concussions occurred during a passing play, 28% during a rushing play, and 21% on a punt or kickoff. Tackling was found to be the most common activity of concussed players, with the side of the helmet the most common helmet impact location. The distribution of helmet impact source-the object that contacted the concussed player's helmet-differed from studies of earlier seasons, with a higher proportion of helmet-to-body impacts (particularly shoulder) and helmet-to-ground impacts and with a lower proportion of helmet-to-helmet impacts. Helmet-to-ground concussive impacts were notable for the high prevalence of impacts to the back of the helmet and their frequency during passing plays. CONCLUSION:: Concussion causation scenarios in the National Football League have changed over time. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:: The results of this study suggest the need for expanded evaluation of concussion countermeasures beyond solely helmet-to-helmet test systems, including consideration of impacts with the ground and with the body of the opposing player. It also suggests the possibility of position-specific countermeasures as part of an ongoing effort to improve safety.",Video Analysis of Reported Concussion Events in the National Football League During the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 Seasons.

"BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) adherence rates are suboptimal among adult black/African Americans. Comprehensive studies characterizing the effectiveness and the methodological approaches to the development of interventions to improve ICS adherence in adult black/African Americans have not been performed. OBJECTIVES: Conduct a systematic review of patient/family-level interventions to improve ICS adherence in adult black/African Americans. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to August 2017 for English-language US studies enrolling at least 30% black/African Americans comparing patient/family-level ICS adherence interventions with any comparator. Two investigators independently selected, extracted data from, and rated risk of bias. We collected information on intervention characteristics and outcomes, and assessed whether studies were informed by behavior theory, stakeholder engagement, or both. RESULTS: Among 1661 abstracts identified, we reviewed 230 full-text articles and identified 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 quasi-experimental (pre-post design) study meeting criteria. Study participants (N range, 17-333) varied in mean age (22-47 years), proportion black/African Americans studied (71%-93%), and sex (69%-82% females). RCTs evaluated problem-solving classes, self-efficacy training, technology-based motivational interviewing program, and the use of patient advocates. The RCT testing self-efficacy training was the only intervention informed by both behavior theory and stakeholder engagement. All 4 RCTs compared interventions with active control and rated as medium risk of bias. No RCTs found a statistically significant improvement in adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies assessing asthma adherence interventions focused on adult black/African-American populations. No RCTs demonstrated improved ICS adherence in participants. Future studies that are informed by behavior change theory and stakeholder engagement are needed.",A Systematic Review of Patient- and Family-Level Inhaled Corticosteroid Adherence Interventions in Black/African Americans.
"Niche theory proposes that in areas of high alcohol availability, alcohol sales outlets will compete for patrons by diversifying their operating characteristics to provide a diversity of drinking contexts. We aimed to characterize features of outlet operations which contribute to increased risk for alcohol problems across communities. We conducted ethnographic observations in 97 on-premise outlets across 6 California cities and interviewed staff and patrons in a subsample of these. We observed outlet managers deliberately altering the environments in 17.5% of establishments. These modifications aimed to increase bar/nightclub effects, enabling venues to ""morph"" (i.e., alter operating conditions from restaurant to bar, or from bar to club) and display environmental characteristics associated with over-service and alcohol-related problems (e.g., more young male patrons, crowding, and dancing). Late night morphing was observed in some outlets in most cities and included outlets operating with restaurant licenses. Staff and patrons identified morphing as a strategy to increase alcohol sales in late night hours. Competition for late night customers may encourage business practices that increase the number of alcohol sales establishments operating under risky circumstances. Community alcohol policies and practices should attend to the potential expansion of risky alcohol sales niches in night time economies.","Late night environments: Bar ""morphing"" increases risky alcohol sales in on-premise outlets."
"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly used agents for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. However, it has long been recognized that there is substantial inter-individual variability in the analgesic response to NSAIDs, reflecting the complex interplay between mechanisms of pain, differences between distinct NSAIDs, and patient-specific factors such as genetic variation. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding how these factors contribute to variability in the analgesic response to NSAIDs.",Variability in analgesic response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
"Pelvic pain is common in both reproductive age and postmenopausal women, and the major etiologies change throughout the life cycle. Chronic pain is defined as lasting for at least 6 months. There are many gastrointestinal and urinary disorders associated with chronic pain in this age group, which are not discussed in this guideline. Pain may be localized to the deep pelvis, with potential causes including pelvic congestion syndrome, intraperitoneal adhesions, hydrosalpinx, chronic inflammatory disease, or cervical stenosis. Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice, while CT and MRI may be appropriate for further characterization of sonographic findings. Alternatively, pain may be localized to the vagina, vulva, or perineum, with potential causes including vaginal atrophy, vaginismus, vaginal or vulvar cysts, vulvodynia, or pelvic myofascial pain. Imaging is primarily indicated in context of an abnormal physical exam and ultrasound is the initial modality of choice, while MRI may be appropriate for further characterization in select cases.

"Although the majority of male breast problems are benign with gynecomastia as the most common etiology, men with breast symptoms and their referring providers are typically concerned about whether or not it is due to breast cancer. If the differentiation between benign disease and breast cancer cannot be made on the basis of clinical findings, or if the clinical presentation is suspicious, imaging is indicated. The panel recommends the following approach to breast imaging in symptomatic men. In men with clinical findings consistent with gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia, no imaging is routinely recommended. If an indeterminate breast mass is identified, the initial recommended imaging study is ultrasound in men younger than age 25, and mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis in men age 25 and older. If physical examination is suspicious for a male breast cancer, mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis is recommended irrespective of patient age.

"Pyelonephritis refers to infection involving the renal parenchyma and renal pelvis. In most patients, uncomplicated pyelonephritis is diagnosed clinically and responds quickly to appropriate antibiotic treatment. If treatment is delayed, the patient is immunocompromised, or for other reasons, microabscesses that form during the acute phase of pyelonephritis may coalesce, forming a renal abscess. Patients with underlying diabetes are more vulnerable to complications, including emphysematous pyelonephritis in addition to abscess formation. Additionally, diabetics may not have the typical flank tenderness that helps to differentiate pyelonephritis from a lower urinary tract infection. Additional high-risk populations may include those with anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, vesicoureteral reflux, obstruction, pregnancy, nosocomial infection, or infection by treatment-resistant pathogens. Treatment goals include symptom relief, elimination of infection to avoid renal damage, and identification of predisposing factors to avoid future recurrences.

"The locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) system is a key nucleus in which endogenous opioid and stress systems intersect to regulate the stress response. LC neurons of male rats become sensitized to stress following chronic morphine administration. Whether sex dictates this pattern of opioid-induced plasticity has not been demonstrated. Delineating the neurobiological adaptations produced by chronic opioids will enhance our understanding of stress vulnerability in opioid-dependent individuals, and may reveal how stress negatively impacts addiction recovery. In the present study, the effect of chronic morphine on the subcellular distribution of mu-opioid (MOR) and CRF receptors (CRFR) was investigated in the LC of male and female rats using immunoelectron microscopy. Results showed that placebo-treated females exhibited higher MOR and CRFR cytoplasmic distribution ratio when compared to placebo-treated males. Chronic morphine exposure induced a shift in the distribution of MOR immunogold-silver particles from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm selectively in male LC neurons. Interestingly, chronic morphine exposure induced CRFR recruitment to the plasma membrane of both male and female LC neurons. These findings provide a potential mechanism by which chronic opioid administration increases stress vulnerability in males and females via an increase in surface availability of CRFR in LC neurons. However, our results also support the notion that cellular adaptations to chronic opioids differ across the sexes as redistribution of MOR following morphine exposure was only observed in male LC neurons.",Sex differences in morphine-induced trafficking of mu-opioid and corticotropin-releasing factor receptors in locus coeruleus neurons.
"The transcription factor RUNX1 is required in the embryo for formation of the adult hematopoietic system. Here, we describe the seminal findings that led to the discovery of RUNX1 and of its critical role in blood cell formation in the embryo from hemogenic endothelium (HE). We also present RNA-sequencing data demonstrating that HE cells in different anatomic sites, which produce hematopoietic progenitors with dissimilar differentiation potentials, are molecularly distinct. Hemogenic and non-HE cells in the yolk sac are more closely related to each other than either is to hemogenic or non-HE cells in the major arteries. Therefore, a major driver of the different lineage potentials of the committed erythro-myeloid progenitors that emerge in the yolk sac versus hematopoietic stem cells that originate in the major arteries is likely to be the distinct molecular properties of the HE cells from which they are derived. We used bioinformatics analyses to predict signaling pathways active in arterial HE, which include the functionally validated pathways Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog. We also used a novel bioinformatics approach to assemble transcriptional regulatory networks and predict transcription factors that may be specifically involved in hematopoietic cell formation from arterial HE, which is the origin of the adult hematopoietic system.",RUNX1 and the endothelial origin of blood.
"D-Serine, an endogenous coagonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) at the glycine binding site, is synthesized by serine racemase (SR) through conversion of l-Serine. Dysregulation of SR/D-Serine and Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia at converging pathways, as perturbation of SR-DISC1 binding in astrocytes elicits schizophrenia-like behaviors in mice. However, an association of neuronal SR with DISC1 remains elusive. Here we report that SR associates with DISC1 and its agglomerates in cortical neurons, which can be modulated by NMDAR activity. Endogenous SR colocalizes with DISC1 large agglomerates in the soma and with smaller puncta in the nucleus and dendrites of cortical neurons. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate SR interaction with DISC1 in cortical neuronal lysates, suggesting the physiological presence of functional SR-DISC1 complexes in neurons. Moreover, exogenous d-Serine application significantly increases the interaction of SR with DISC1, the number of DISC1-SR large agglomerates and the levels of DISC1 agglomerated form along with SR in the triton-insoluble pellet fraction, whereas application of glycine with a glycine transporter inhibitor fails to increase their interactions, abundance of DISC1-SR large agglomerates and levels of DISC1 agglomerated form. This increase by d-Serine application is blocked by 7-chlorokynurenic acid, a specific antagonist at the glycine site of NMDARs, suggesting mediation through NMDARs. Our findings thus demonstrate neuronal SR association with DISC1 and its agglomerates, which can be modulated by d-Serine, thereby validating a novel neuronal SR-DISC1 complex responsive to NMDAR activation and providing a molecular mechanism by which pathways implicated in schizophrenia converge.",Neuronal serine racemase associates with Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 and DISC1 agglomerates: Implications for schizophrenia.
"In resting cells, the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) family of transcription factors is stabilized by complexation with the cytoplasmic inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IkappaBalpha). Extracellular stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or bacterial lipopolysaccharide activate NF-kappaB through IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. Herein, we developed a novel biosensor, by fusing the monomeric fluorescent protein Kusabira-Orange 2 to IkappaBalpha (mKO2-IkappaBalpha), to study the dynamics and structure-activity relationship of IkappaBalpha degradation. Site-specific deletion studies on the IkappaBalpha sequence revealed that the C-terminal PEST domain is required in signal-induced proteasomal degradation of IkappaBalpha and functions independently from ankyrin repeats. Using deletion mutants, we show that IkappaBalpha ankyrin repeats do not affect IkappaBalpha degradability but affect its degradation rate. We demonstrate, by both real-time confocal microscopy and western blot analysis, that the half-life of mKO2-IkappaBalpha in response to TNFalpha is approximately 35min, which is similar to the half-life of endogenous IkappaBalpha. Using this biosensor we also show that selective proteasome inhibitors, such as lactacystin and MG132, inhibit degradation and affect the kinetics of IkappaBalpha in a dose-dependent manner. The techniques described here can have a range of possible applications, such as facilitating studies associated with IkappaBalpha dynamics and biochemical characteristics, as well as the screening of potential proteasome inhibitors.",Development of mKO2 fusion proteins for real-time imaging and mechanistic investigation of the degradation kinetics of human IkappaBalpha in living cells.
"BACKGROUND: The influence of Fontan-associated protein-losing enteropathy's (PLE) severity, duration, and treatment on heart transplant (HTx) outcomes is unknown. We hypothesized that long-standing PLE and PLE requiring more intensive therapy are associated with increased post-HTx mortality. METHODS: This 12-center, retrospective cohort study of post-Fontan patients with PLE referred for HTx from 2003 to 2015 involved collection of demographic, medical, surgical, and catheterization data, as well as PLE-specific data, including duration of disease, intensity/details of treatment, hospitalizations, and complications. Factors associated with waitlist and post-HTx outcomes and PLE resolution were sought. RESULTS: Eighty patients (median of 5 per center) were referred for HTx evaluation. Of 68 patients listed for HTx, 8 were removed due to deterioration, 4 died waiting, and 4 remain listed. In 52 patients undergoing HTx, post-HTx 1-month survival was 92% and 1-year survival was 83%. PLE-specific factors, including duration of PLE pre-HTx, pre-HTx hospitalizations, need for/frequency of albumin replacement, PLE therapies, and growth parameters had no association with post-HTx mortality. Immunosuppressant regimen was associated with mortality; standard mycophenolate mofetil immunotherapy was used in 95% of survivors compared with only 44% of non-survivors (p=0.03). Rejection (53%) and infection (42%) post-HTx were common, but not associated with PLE-specific factors. PLE resolved completely in all but 1 HTx survivor at a median of 1 month (interquartile range 1 to 3 months); resolution was not affected by PLE-specific factors. CONCLUSIONS: PLE severity, duration, and treatment do not influence post-HTx outcome, but immunosuppressive regimen may have an impact on survival. PLE resolves in nearly all survivors.",Fontan-associated protein-losing enteropathy and postheart transplant outcomes: A multicenter study.
"BACKGROUND: A long-term trial showed that the oral prostacyclin (PGl2) receptor (IP) agonist, selexipag, delayed disease progression in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Transition to selexipag in patients treated with more burdensome inhaled therapies that target the prostacyclin pathway may be considered by patients and physicians. The Phase 3b, prospective, open-label TRANSIT-1 (Tolerability and Safety of the Transition From Inhaled Treprostinil to Oral Selexipag in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension) study evaluated the safety and tolerability of transition from inhaled treprostinil to oral selexipag. METHODS: Patients receiving non-prostanoid oral PAH therapy and inhaled treprostinil at stable doses, in World Health Organization Functional Class II/III, with 6-minute walk distance >/= 300 meters were enrolled. The 16-week main treatment period included downtitration of inhaled treprostinil over 8 weeks and parallel uptitration of selexipag over 12 weeks. Sustained treatment transition at Week 16 was defined as (1) receiving selexipag at Week 16; (2) no selexipag interruption(s) totaling >/= 8 days; and (3) no inhaled treprostinil or other prostanoids after Week 8. Clinical parameters and patient-reported treatment satisfaction outcomes were assessed at Week 16. RESULTS: All 34 enrolled patients completed the study. At Week 16, 32 patients (94.1%) had stopped inhaled treprostinil and were receiving selexipag. Twenty-eight patients (82.4%) met all criteria for sustained treatment transition. During the study, 3 patients discontinued selexipag due to adverse events. Overall, most adverse events were typical of prostanoid therapies and started during the uptitration phase. In general, patients remained clinically stable throughout treatment and reported improved convenience. CONCLUSIONS: Transition to oral selexipag from inhaled treprostinil in PAH patients was successful and well tolerated in most patients, and associated with greater convenience.

"Bacterial surfaces are decorated with carbohydrate structures that may serve as ligands for host receptors. Based on their ability to recognize specific sugar epitopes, plant lectins are extensively used for bacteria typing. We previously observed that the galactose-specific agglutinins from Ricinus communis (RCA) and Viscum album (VAA) exhibited differential binding to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) clinical isolates, their binding being distinctly affected by truncation of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Here, we examined their binding to the structurally similar LOS molecules isolated from strains NTHi375 and RdKW20, using microarray binding assays, saturation transfer difference NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations. RCA bound the LOSRdKW20 glycoform displaying terminal Galbeta(1,4)Glcbeta, whereas VAA recognized the Galalpha(1,4)Galbeta(1,4)Glcbeta epitope in LOSNTHi375 but not in LOSRdKW20, unveiling a different presentation. Binding assays to whole bacterial cells were consistent with LOSNTHi375 serving as ligand for VAA, and also suggested recognition of the glycoprotein HMW1. Regarding RCA, comparable binding to NTHi375 and RdKW20 cells was observed. Interestingly, an increase in LOSNTHi375 abundance or expression of HMW1 in RdKW20 impaired RCA binding. Overall, the results revealed that, besides the LOS, other carbohydrate structures on the bacterial surface serve as lectin ligands, and highlighted the impact of the specific display of cell surface components on lectin binding.",Differential recognition of Haemophilus influenzae whole bacterial cells and isolated lipooligosaccharides by galactose-specific lectins.
"In patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a decrease in the brain reward function was reported in behavioral- and in neuroimaging studies. While pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this response are unclear, there are several lines of evidence suggesting over-recruitment of the brain reward regions by aversive stimuli rendering them unavailable to respond to reward-related content. The purpose of this study was to juxtapose brain responses to functional neuroimaging probes that reliably produce rewarding and aversive experiences in PTSD subjects and in healthy controls. The stimuli used were pleasant, aversive and neutral images selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) along with pain-inducing heat applied to the dorsum of the left hand; all were administered during 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging. Analyses of IAPS responses for the pleasant images revealed significantly decreased subjective ratings and brain activations in PTSD subjects that included striatum and medial prefrontal-, parietal- and temporal cortices. For the aversive images, decreased activations were observed in the amygdala and in the thalamus. PTSD and healthy subjects provided similar subjective ratings of thermal sensory thresholds and each of the temperatures. When 46 degrees C (hot) and 42 degrees C (neutral) temperatures were contrasted, voxelwise between-group comparison revealed greater activations in the striatum, amygdala, hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex in the PTSD subjects. These latter findings were for the most part mirrored by the 44 vs. 42 degrees C contrast. Our data suggest different brain alterations patterns in PTSD, namely relatively diminished corticolimbic response to pleasant and aversive psychosocial stimuli in the face of exaggerated response to heat-related pain. The present findings support the hypothesis that brain sensitization to pain in PTSD may interfere with the processing of psychosocial stimuli whether they are of rewarding or aversive valence.",Reward and aversion processing in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder: functional neuroimaging with visual and thermal stimuli.
"Natural killer (NK) cells recognize and eliminate infected and malignant cells. Their life histories are poorly understood, particularly in humans, due to lack of informative models and endogenous clonal markers. Here, we apply transplantation of barcoded rhesus macaque hematopoietic cells to interrogate the landscape of NK cell production, expansion, and life histories at a clonal level long term and after proliferative challenge. We identify oligoclonal populations of rhesus CD56(-)CD16(+) NK cells that are characterized by marked expansions and contractions over time yet remained long-term clonally uncoupled from other hematopoietic lineages, including CD56(+)CD16(-) NK cells. Individual or groups of CD56(-)CD16(+) expanded clones segregated with surface expression of specific killer immunoglobulin-like receptors. These clonally distinct NK cell subpopulation patterns persisted for more than 4years, including after transient in vivo anti-CD16-mediated depletion and subsequent regeneration. Profound and sustained interleukin-15-mediated depletion was required to generate new oligoclonal CD56(-)CD16(+) NK cells. Together, our results indicate that linear NK cell production from multipotent hematopoietic progenitors or less mature CD56(+)CD16(-) cells is negligible during homeostasis and moderate proliferative stress. In such settings, peripheral compartmentalized self-renewal can maintain the composition of distinct, differentiated NK cell subpopulations.",Clonal expansion and compartmentalized maintenance of rhesus macaque NK cell subsets.
"Long-term daylight deprivation such as during the Antarctic winter has been shown to lead to delayed sleep timing and sleep fragmentation. We aimed at testing whether retinal sensitivity, sleep and circadian rest-activity will change during long-term daylight deprivation on two Antarctic bases (Concordia and Halley VI) in a total of 25 healthy crew members (mean age: 34 +/- 11y; 7f). The pupil responses to different light stimuli were used to assess retinal sensitivity changes. Rest-activity cycles were continuously monitored by activity watches. Overall, our data showed increased pupil responses under scotopic (mainly rod-dependent), photopic (mainly L-/M-cone dependent) as well as bright-blue light (mainly melanopsin-dependent) conditions during the time without direct sunlight. Circadian rhythm analysis revealed a significant decay of intra-daily stability, indicating more fragmented rest-activity rhythms during the dark period. Sleep and wake times (as assessed from rest-activity recordings) were significantly delayed after the first month without sunlight (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that during long-term daylight deprivation, retinal sensitivity to blue light increases, whereas circadian rhythm stability decreases and sleep-wake timing is delayed.","Impact of long-term daylight deprivation on retinal light sensitivity, circadian rhythms and sleep during the Antarctic winter."
"Background: Although sickle cell trait (SCT) is largely a benign carrier state, it may increase risk for certain clinical outcomes. Purpose: To evaluate associations between SCT and clinical outcomes in children and adults. Data Sources: English-language searches of PubMed, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Current Contents Connect, Scopus, and Embase (1 January 1970 to 30 June 2018) and bibliographies of review articles. Study Selection: Observational controlled studies (published in English) in children or adults that examined an association between SCT and any of 24 clinical outcomes specified a priori in the following 6 categories: exertion-related injury; renal, vascular, pediatric, and surgery- or trauma-related outcomes; and overall mortality. Data Extraction: A single reviewer extracted study data, which was checked by another; 2 reviewers independently assessed study quality; and strength of evidence was assessed by consensus. Data Synthesis: Of 7083 screened studies, 41 met inclusion criteria. High-strength evidence supported a positive association between SCT and risk for pulmonary embolism, proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease. Moderate-strength evidence supported a positive association between SCT and exertional rhabdomyolysis and a null association between SCT and deep venous thrombosis, heart failure or cardiomyopathy, stroke, and pediatric height or weight. Absolute risks for thromboembolism and rhabdomyolysis were small. For the remaining 15 clinical outcomes, data were insufficient or strength of evidence was low. Limitation: Publication bias was possible, and high-quality evidence was scant. Conclusion: Sickle cell trait is a risk factor for a few adverse health outcomes, such as pulmonary embolism, kidney disease, and exertional rhabdomyolysis, but does not seem to be associated with such complications as heart failure and stroke. Insufficient data or low-strength evidence exists for most speculated complications of SCT.

This study also investigated the theoretical model underlying the JJAM treatment, which proposed that reductions in hostile attribution biases, development of emotion regulation skills, and improvement in social problem solving would serve as mechanisms of action in JJAM. Participants were 70 female youth who ranged in age from 14 to 20 years (M = 17.45, SD = 1.24) and were placed at 1 of 3 participating juvenile justice facilities; 57 youth completed the study and were included in analyses. Results revealed greater reductions in anger, reactive physical aggression, and reactive relational aggression among girls in the JJAM treatment condition when compared to girls in the TAU control condition. The proposed theoretical model was partially supported via significant mediation findings; changes in hostile attribution bias were identified as a significant mechanism of action in the JJAM treatment. Results suggest that JJAM is a promising treatment to effectively reduce anger and reactive aggression among adolescent girls in juvenile justice placements.

"Cognitive health is an important dimension of well-being in older ages, but few studies have investigated the demography of cognitive health in sub-Saharan Africa's (SSA) growing population of mature adults (= persons age 45+). We use data from the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH) to document the age and gender patterns of cognitive health, the contextual and life-course correlates of poor cognitive health, and the understudied linkages between cognitive and physical/mental well-being. Surprisingly, the age-pattern of decline in cognitive health is broadly similar to that observed in the U.S. We also find that women have substantially worse cognitive health than men, and experience a steeper age-gradient in cognitive ability. Strong social ties and exposure to socially complex environments are associated with higher cognitive health, as is higher socioeconomic status. Poor cognitive health is associated with adverse social and economic well-being outcomes such as less nutrition intake, lower income, and reduced work efforts even in this subsistence agriculture context. Lower levels of cognitive health are also strongly associated with increased levels of depression and anxiety, and are associated with worse physical health measured through both self-reports and physical performance. Our findings suggest that cognition plays a key-but understudied-role in shaping late-life well-being in low-income populations.","Cognition, Health, and Well-Being in a Rural Sub-Saharan African Population."
"Risk for stress-sensitive psychopathologies differs in men and women, yet little is known about sex-dependent effects of stress on cellular structure and function in corticolimbic regions implicated in these disorders. Determining how stress influences these regions in males and females will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying sex-biased psychopathology. Here, we discuss sex differences in CRF regulation of arousal and cognition, glucocorticoid modulation of amygdalar physiology and alcohol consumption, the age-dependent impact of social stress on prefrontal pyramidal cell excitability, stress effects on the prefrontal parvalbumin system in relation to emotional behaviors, contributions of stress and gonadal hormones to stress effects on prefrontal glia, and alterations in corticolimbic structure and function after cessation of chronic stress. These studies demonstrate that, while sex differences in stress effects may be nuanced, nonuniform, and nonlinear, investigations of these differences are nonetheless critical for developing effective, sex-specific treatments for psychological disorders.",Sex Differences in Risk and Resilience: Stress Effects on the Neural Substrates of Emotion and Motivation.
"Monoallelic point mutations in the gene encoding the cytosolic, NADP(+)-dependent enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) cause increased production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in multiple cancers. Most IDH1 mutant tumors retain one wildtype (WT) IDH1 allele. Several studies have proposed that retention of this WT allele is protumorigenic by facilitating substrate channeling through a WT-mutant IDH1 heterodimer, with the WT subunit generating a local supply of alpha-ketoglutarate and NADPH that is then consumed by the mutant subunit to produce 2-HG. Here, we confirmed that coexpression of WT and mutant IDH1 subunits leads to formation of WT-mutant hetero-oligomers and increases 2-HG production. An analysis of a recently reported crystal structure of the WT-R132H IDH1 heterodimer and of in vitro kinetic parameters for 2-HG production, however, indicated that substrate channeling between the subunits is biophysically implausible. We also found that putative carbon-substrate flux between WT and mutant IDH1 subunits is inconsistent with the results of isotope tracing experiments in cancer cells harboring an endogenous monoallelic IDH1 mutation. Finally, using a mathematical model of WT-mutant IDH1 heterodimers, we estimated that the NADPH:NADP(+) ratio is higher in the cytosol than in the mitochondria, suggesting that NADPH is unlikely to be limiting for 2-HG production in the cytosol. These findings argue against supply of either substrate being limiting for 2-HG production by a cytosolic IDH1 mutant and suggest that the retention of a WT allele in IDH1 mutant tumors is not due to a requirement for carbon or cofactor flux between WT and mutant IDH1.",Lack of evidence for substrate channeling or flux between wildtype and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase to produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate.
"Sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) designs have become increasingly popular in the field of precision medicine by providing a means for comparing more than two sequences of treatments tailored to the individual patient, i.e., dynamic treatment regime (DTR). The construction of evidence-based DTRs promises a replacement to ad hoc one-size-fits-all decisions pervasive in patient care. However, there are substantial statistical challenges in sizing SMART designs due to the correlation structure between the DTRs embedded in the design (EDTR). Since a primary goal of SMARTs is the construction of an optimal EDTR, investigators are interested in sizing SMARTs based on the ability to screen out EDTRs inferior to the optimal EDTR by a given amount which cannot be done using existing methods. In this article, we fill this gap by developing a rigorous power analysis framework that leverages the multiple comparisons with the best methodology. Our method employs Monte Carlo simulation to compute the number of individuals to enroll in an arbitrary SMART. We evaluate our method through extensive simulation studies. We illustrate our method by retrospectively computing the power in the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone (EXTEND) trial. An R package implementing our methodology is available to download from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.",Power analysis in a SMART design: sample size estimation for determining the best embedded dynamic treatment regime.
"At the most fundamental level, the bowel facilitates absorption of small molecules, regulates fluid and electrolyte flux, and eliminates waste. To successfully coordinate this complex array of functions, the bowel relies on the enteric nervous system (ENS), an intricate network of more than 500 million neurons and supporting glia that are organized into distinct layers or plexi within the bowel wall. Neuron and glial diversity, as well as neurotransmitter and receptor expression in the ENS, resembles that of the central nervous system. The most carefully studied ENS functions include control of bowel motility, epithelial secretion, and blood flow, but the ENS also interacts with enteroendocrine cells, influences epithelial proliferation and repair, modulates the intestinal immune system, and mediates extrinsic nerve input. Here, we review the many different cell types that communicate with the ENS, integrating data about ENS function into a broader view of human health and disease. In particular, we focus on exciting new literature highlighting relationships between the ENS and its lesser-known interacting partners.",Unexpected Roles for the Second Brain: Enteric Nervous System as Master Regulator of Bowel Function.
"BACKGROUND: Hospital resource overutilization can significantly disrupt patient treatment such as cancelling surgical patients due to a lack of intensive care unit (ICU) space. The authors describe a clinical pathway (CP) designed to reduce ICU length of stay (LOS) for nonsyndromic single-suture craniosynostosis (nsSSC) patients undergoing cranial vault reconstruction (CVR) in order to minimize surgical disruptions and improve patient outcomes. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team implemented a perioperative CP including scheduled laboratory testing to decrease ICU LOS. Hospital and ICU LOS, interventions, and perioperative morbidity-infection rate, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, and unplanned return to the operating room (OR)-were compared using Mann-Whitney U, Fisher exact, and t tests. RESULTS: Fifty-one ICU admissions were managed with the standardized CP and compared to 49 admissions in the 12 months prior to pathway implementation. There was a significant reduction in ICU LOS (control: mean 1.84 +/- 0.93, median 1.89 +/- 0.94; CP: mean 1.15 +/- 0.34, median 1.03 +/- 0.34 days; P < 0.001 for both). There were similar rates of hypotension requiring intervention (CP: 2, control: 1; P = 0.999), postoperative transfusion (CP: 3, control: 0; P = 0.243), and artificial ventilation (CP: 1, control: 0; P = 0.999). Perioperative morbidity such as infection (CP: 1, control: 0; P = 0.999), return to the OR (CP: 1, control: 0; P = 0.999), and CSF leak (no leaks; P = 0.999) was also similar. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a standardized perioperative CP for nsSSC patients resulted in a significantly shorter ICU LOS without a measured change in perioperative morbidity. Pathways such as the one described that improve patient throughput and decrease resource utilization benefit craniofacial teams in conducting an efficient service while providing high-quality care.",A Standardized Perioperative Clinical Pathway for Uncomplicated Craniosynostosis Repair Is Associated With Reduced Hospital Resource Utilization.

"In a 2016 survey of imaging informatics (""II"") fellowship graduates, the surveyed fellowship graduates expressed the ""opinion that II fellowships needed further formalization and standardization"" Liao et al. (J Digit Imaging, 2016). This, coupled with the fact that the original published ""standardized"" curriculum is about 15 years out of date in our rapidly changing systems, suggests an opportunity for curriculum improvement. Before agreeing on improved structural and content suggestions for fellowships, we completed a current-state assessment of how each fellowship organizes its education and what requirements each have for fellowship completion. In this work, we aimed to collect existing information about imaging informatics fellowship curricula by contacting institutions across the country. A survey was completed by phone with the fellowship directors of existing imaging informatics fellowships across the country. Additionally, we collected existing documentation that outlines the curricula currently in use at institutions. We reviewed both the interview responses and documentation to assess overlapping trends and institutional differences in curriculum structure and content. All fellowships had suggested reading lists, didactic lectures, and a required project for each fellow. There were required practicum activities or teaching experience each in two fellowships, and one fellowship had a mandatory certification requirement for graduation. Curriculum topics in Technical Informatics or Business and Management were covered by a majority of institutions, while Quality and Safety and Research topics had inconsistent coverage across fellowships. Our plan is to reengage II fellowship directors to develop a core curriculum, which is part of the Society of Imaging Informatics in Medicine strategic plan.",A Survey of Imaging Informatics Fellowships and Their Curricula: Current State Assessment.
"OBJECTIVE:: Measurement-based care using patient-reported outcome measures has been shown to improve treatment outcomes for patients with mental illness. Despite wide availability of validated measures, measurement-based care is seldom used in clinical practice. METHODS:: The authors conducted a survey of 230 mental health providers across 47 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. The survey measured provider attitudes and self-reported use of various components of measurement-based care. RESULTS:: More than half of the providers (58%) reported collecting at least one measure for at least half of their patients. Psychiatrists reported using and sharing results less frequently than social workers, nurses, or psychologists. Psychologists reported the most use and sharing of patient-reported measures. CONCLUSIONS:: In this convenience sample of providers, use of measurement-based care was reported to be common and attitudes about the utility of such care were positive. However, professional differences in the use of measurement-based care must be addressed to expand its use.",Provider Attitudes and Experience With Measurement-Based Mental Health Care in the VA Implementation Project.
"BACKGROUND: Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is cited as an effective approach for improving blood pressure control. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of HBPM combined with a health education session in reducing blood pressure and improving medication adherence among adults with hypertension. METHODS: Two hundred thirteen participants were enrolled in a 3-month study and randomized to receive HBPM or usual care. Participants were also randomized to receive an educational session delivered using a pamphlet or a computer-based program. Topics of the educational session included preventing hypertension, managing weight, staying active, and cutting down on salt and fat. RESULTS: At the 3-month follow-up, there was a reduction in ambulatory blood pressure among the HBPM group. However, the differences found within the HBPM group were no greater than those found among the control group. We did not detect a statistically significant difference in adherence to medication when comparing the HBPM to the usual care group. CONCLUSIONS: HBPM and educational session did not lower blood pressure or improve medication adherence in our sample. A greater effect may have been seen if coupled with an enhanced educational intervention and if blood pressure measures were shared with the provided. The findings of this study provide useful insights for future HBPM studies.",The Effectiveness of Home Blood Pressure on 24-Hour Blood Pressure Control: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
"Background Aortic valve sclerosis ( AVS c), the early asymptomatic presentation of calcific aortic valve (AV) disease, affects 25% to 30% of patients aged >65 years. In vitro and ex vivo experiments with antioxidant strategies and antagonists of osteogenic differentiation revealed that AVS c is reversible. In this study, we characterized the underlying changes in the extracellular matrix architecture and valve interstitial cell activation in AVSc and tested in vitro and in vivo the activity of a clinically approved SOD (superoxide dismutase) mimic and redox-active drug MnTnBu OE -2-PyP(5+) ( BMX -001). Methods and Results After receiving informed consent, samples from patients with AVS c, AV stenosis, and controls were collected. Uniaxial mechanical stimulation and in vitro studies on human valve interstitial cells were performed. An angiotensin II chronic infusion model was used to impose AV thickening and remodeling. We characterized extracellular matrix structures by small-angle light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, histology, and mass spectrometry. Diseased human valves showed altered collagen fiber alignment and ultrastructural changes in AVS c, accumulation of oxidized cross-linking products in AV stenosis, and reversible expression of extracellular matrix regulators ex vivo. We demonstrated that MnTnBu OE -2-PyP(5+) inhibits human valve interstitial cell activation and extracellular matrix remodeling in a murine model (C57 BL /6J) of AVS c by electron microscopy and histology. Conclusions AVS c is associated with architectural remodeling despite marginal effects on the mechanical properties in both human and mice. MnTnBu OE -2-PyP(5+) controls AV thickening in a murine model of AVS c. Because this compound has been approved recently for clinical use, this work could shift the focus for the treatment of calcific AV disease, moving from AV stenosis to an earlier presentation ( AVS c) that could be more responsive to medical therapies.",Porphyrin-Based SOD Mimic MnTnBu OE -2-PyP(5+) Inhibits Mechanisms of Aortic Valve Remodeling in Human and Murine Models of Aortic Valve Sclerosis.
"IMPORTANCE: Health disparities in the clinical presentation and outcomes among youth with type 1 diabetes exist. Long-term glycemic control patterns in racially/ethnically diverse youth are not well described. OBJECTIVES: To model common trajectories of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) among youth with type 1 diabetes and test how trajectory group membership varies by race/ethnicity. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal cohort study conducted in 5 US locations. The analysis included data from 1313 youths (aged <20 years) newly diagnosed in 2002 through 2005 with type 1 diabetes in the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study (mean [SD] age at diabetes onset, 8.9 [4.2] years) who had 3 or more HbA1c study measures during 6.1 to 13.3 years of follow-up. Data were analyzed in 2017. EXPOSURES: Self-reported race/ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hemoglobin A1c trajectories identified through group-based trajectory modeling over a mean (SD) of 9.0 (1.4) years of diabetes duration. Multinomial models studied the association of race/ethnicity with HbA1c trajectory group membership, adjusting for demographic characteristics, clinical factors, and socioeconomic position. RESULTS: The final study sample of 1313 patients was 49.3% female (647 patients) with mean (SD) age 9.7 (4.3) years and mean (SD) disease duration of 9.2 (6.3) months at baseline. The racial/ethnic composition was 77.0% non-Hispanic white (1011 patients), 10.7% Hispanic (140 patients), 9.8% non-Hispanic black (128 patients), and 2.6% other race/ethnicity (34 patients). Three HbA1c trajectories were identified: group 1, low baseline and mild increases (50.7% [666 patients]); group 2, moderate baseline and moderate increases (41.7% [548 patients]); and group 3, moderate baseline and major increases (7.5% [99 patients]). Group 3 was composed of 47.5% nonwhite youths (47 patients). Non-Hispanic black youth had 7.98 higher unadjusted odds (95% CI, 4.42-14.38) than non-Hispanic white youth of being in the highest HbA1c trajectory group relative to the lowest HbA1c trajectory group; the association remained significant after full adjustment (adjusted odds ratio of non-Hispanic black race in group 3 vs group 1, 4.54; 95% CI, 2.08-9.89). Hispanic youth had 3.29 higher unadjusted odds (95% CI, 1.78-6.08) than non-Hispanic white youth of being in the highest HbA1c trajectory group relative to the lowest HbA1c trajectory group; the association remained significant after adjustment (adjusted odds ratio of Hispanic ethnicity in group 3 vs group 1, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.02-4.92). In stratified analyses, the adjusted odds of nonwhite membership in the highest HbA1c trajectory remained significant among male patients and youth diagnosed at age 9 years or younger, but not female patients and youth who were older than 9 years when they were diagnosed (P for interaction = .04 [sex] and .02 [age at diagnosis]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There are racial/ethnic differences in long-term glycemic control among youth with type 1 diabetes, particularly among nonwhite male patients and nonwhite youth diagnosed earlier in life.",Association of Race and Ethnicity With Glycemic Control and Hemoglobin A1c Levels in Youth With Type 1 Diabetes.
"Although colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in the United States has been increasing, screening rates are not optimal, and there are persistent disparities in CRC screening and mortality, particularly among minority patients. As most CRC screening takes place in primary care, health systems are well-positioned to address this important population health problem. However, most health systems have not actively engaged in identifying and implementing effective evidence-based intervention strategies that can raise CRC screening rates and reduce disparities. Drawing on the Collective Impact Model and the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation, our project team applied a learning community strategy to help two health systems in southeastern Pennsylvania identify evidence-based CRC screening interventions for primary care patients. Initially, this approach involved activating a coordinating team, steering committee (health system leadership and stakeholder organizations), and patient and stakeholder advisory committee to identify candidate CRC screening intervention strategies. The coordinating team guided the steering committee through a scoping review to identify seven randomized trials that identified interventions that addressed CRC screening disparities. Subsequently, the coordinating team and steering committee applied a screening intervention classification typology to select an intervention strategy that involved using an outreach strategy to provide minority patients with access to both stool blood test and colonoscopy screening. Finally, the coordinating team and steering committee engaged the health system patient and stakeholder advisory committee in planning for intervention implementation, thus taking up the challenge of reducing and important health disparity in patient populations served by the two health systems.",A learning community approach to identifying interventions in health systems to reduce colorectal cancer screening disparities.
"The right to bodily self-determination has a firm foothold in American jurisprudence and legislation. Since the early 20th century, courts have consistently upheld individuals' rights to govern their bodies, citing the constitutional right to privacy and importance of individual autonomy. After these decisions, the advance directive has become an essential way to express personal preferences after incapacity for decision-making, especially in end-of-life scenarios. Can sexual preferences survive cognitive incapacity as well? When individuals lose the capacity to voice sexual needs and preferences, there is no mechanism to protect sexual expression. Dementia's ability to render individuals legally incapable of consenting to sexual activity was the focus of the case of Iowa legislator Henry Rayhons. The state charged Mr. Rayhons with assault for alleged sexual interactions with his wife, who had Alzheimer's disease. The prosecution failed to prove its case. We propose a hypothetical sexual advance directive as a theoretical mechanism to assert sexual desire past incapacity, grounded in claims regarding the possible importance of sex for individuals with neurocognitive disorders. Forensic psychiatrists can play a unique role in the creation and implementation of such a tool.",Consent for Intimacy Among Persons With Neurocognitive Impairment.
"GD2 is a ganglioside found in the plasma membrane of the neural crest-derived cancer, neuroblastoma. GD2 is shed into the circulation of patients with neuroblastoma and could serve as a tumor biomarker to monitor tumor burden or response to treatment. We developed and validated a high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method to quantify the D18:1-18:0 (C18) and the D18:1-20:0 (C20) lipoforms of GD2 in human plasma and serum. Human brain derived GD2 containing a mixture of C18 and C20 was used as the analytical standard. Samples were extracted with methanol containing dueterated-GM1 (internal standard), and analytes were separated on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column eluted with a gradient mobile phase composed of ammonium acetate buffer, methanol and isopropanol. An AB Sciex 4500 QTRAP mass spectrometer in negative ion mode was used to quantify the doubly charged GD2 C18 and C20 lipoform precursor ions (m/z 836.8 and m/z 850.8) that both yield a product ion of m/z 290.0. The calibration curves were linear from 4-1000ng/mL and 6-1500ng/mL for GD2 C18 and C20 lipoforms respectively. Inter-day and intra-day accuracy were within the acceptable validation range in plasma and serum.","A validated HPLC-MS/MS method for estimating the concentration of the ganglioside, GD2, in human plasma or serum."
"Thyroid dysfunction is an important public health problem, which affects 10% of the general population and increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of thyroid hormone regulation have only partly been elucidated, including its transport, metabolism, and genetic determinants. Here we report a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for thyroid function and dysfunction, testing 8 million genetic variants in up to 72,167 individuals. One-hundred-and-nine independent genetic variants are associated with these traits. A genetic risk score, calculated to assess their combined effects on clinical end points, shows significant associations with increased risk of both overt (Graves' disease) and subclinical thyroid disease, as well as clinical complications. By functional follow-up on selected signals, we identify a novel thyroid hormone transporter (SLC17A4) and a metabolizing enzyme (AADAT). Together, these results provide new knowledge about thyroid hormone physiology and disease, opening new possibilities for therapeutic targets.",Genome-wide analyses identify a role for SLC17A4 and AADAT in thyroid hormone regulation.

"PURPOSE: This study investigates the impact of incorporating observer-reported workload into workplace-based assessment (WBA) scores on (1) psychometric characteristics of WBA scores and (2) measuring changes in performance over time using workload-unadjusted versus workload-adjusted scores. METHOD: Structured clinical observations and multisource feedback instruments were used to collect WBA data from first-year pediatrics residents at 10 residency programs between July 2016 and June 2017. Observers completed items in 8 subcompetencies associated with Pediatrics Milestones. Faculty and resident observers assessed workload using a sliding scale ranging from low to high; all item scores were rescaled to a 1-5 scale to facilitate analysis and interpretation. Workload-adjusted WBA scores were calculated at the item level using three different approaches, and aggregated for analysis at the competency level. Mixed-effects regression models were used to estimate variance components. Longitudinal growth curve analyses examined patterns of developmental score change over time. RESULTS: On average, participating residents (n = 252) were assessed 5.32 times (standard deviation = 3.79) by different raters during the data collection period. Adjusting for workload yielded better discrimination of learner performance, and higher reliability, reducing measurement error by 28%. Projections in reliability indicated needing up to twice the number of raters when workload-unadjusted scores were used. Longitudinal analysis showed an increase in scores over time, with significant interaction between workload and time; workload also increased significantly over time. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating a measure of observer-reported workload could improve the measurement properties and the ability to interpret WBA scores.",Does Incorporating a Measure of Clinical Workload Improve Workplace-Based Assessment Scores?

"When the brain has determined the position of a moving object, because of anatomical and processing delays the object will have already moved to a new location. Given the statistical regularities present in natural motion, the brain may have acquired compensatory mechanisms to minimize the mismatch between the perceived and real positions of moving objects. A well-known visual illusion-the flash lag effect-points toward such a possibility. Although many psychophysical models have been suggested to explain this illusion, their predictions have not been tested at the neural level, particularly in a species of animal known to perceive the illusion. To this end, we recorded neural responses to flashed and moving bars from primary visual cortex (V1) of awake, fixating macaque monkeys. We found that the response latency to moving bars of varying speed, motion direction, and luminance was shorter than that to flashes, in a manner that is consistent with psychophysical results. At the level of V1, our results support the differential latency model positing that flashed and moving bars have different latencies. As we found a neural correlate of the illusion in passively fixating monkeys, our results also suggest that judging the instantaneous position of the moving bar at the time of flash-as required by the postdiction/motion-biasing model-may not be necessary for observing a neural correlate of the illusion. Our results also suggest that the brain may have evolved mechanisms to process moving stimuli faster and closer to real time compared with briefly appearing stationary stimuli. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We report several observations in awake macaque V1 that provide support for the differential latency model of the flash lag illusion. We find that the equal latency of flash and moving stimuli as assumed by motion integration/postdiction models does not hold in V1. We show that in macaque V1, motion processing latency depends on stimulus luminance, speed and motion direction in a manner consistent with several psychophysical properties of the flash lag illusion.",Faster processing of moving compared with flashed bars in awake macaque V1 provides a neural correlate of the flash lag illusion.
"Zeitgebers such as light, eating and physical activity provide input to the circadian clock. Chronic circadian misalignment is associated with significant adverse health effects. An improved understanding of the impact of the timing of zeitgebers on the stability of 24-hour rest-activity rhythm in free-living settings may identify behavioural and environmental intervention targets. A total of 133 healthy adults, aged 21-60 years, wore a wrist actigraph for 7 consecutive days. We applied a non-parametric analysis to activity counts to derive rest-activity patterns. We administered a questionnaire through a smartphone app to collect self-reported timing of light exposure, eating episodes and physical activity. To assess the relationship between timing exposures (first and last exposure to outdoor light, first exposure to indoor light, last eating episode, first eating episode, morning physical activity proportion, evening physical activity proportion) and rest-activity or sleep outcomes (bedtimes, total sleep time, inter-daily stability, intra-daily variability, L5 and M10 midpoint), we first calculated Spearman correlations, using the false discovery rate method to control for multiple comparisons. From those significant associations, we then fit regression models adjusting for age, sex, race, household income, education level, study site, body mass index, as well as physical activity. Finally, we tested for interaction between chronotype and each timing-related exposure and stratified the analysis by morning type. All zeitgebers, except for evening physical activity proportion, were correlated with at least four of the seven sleep and rest-activity outcomes. In adjusted analysis, later timing of first (after 6:30 to 7:45 AM versus earlier) and last exposure to indoor light (after 11:00 PM versus earlier) and first (after 7:45-9:45 AM versus earlier) and last eating episode (after 8:00-09:00 PM versus earlier) were associated with a shift of 0.60-1.39 hours to later bedtimes, M10 and L5 midpoints (i.e. timing of peak activities or inactivities). Later timing of first exposure to outdoor light (after 09:30 AM versus earlier) was also associated with 0.51 (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.83) hours longer total sleep time. Higher morning physical activity proportion (> 33%) was associated with 0.95 (95% CI: -1.38 to -0.53) hours earlier in-bed time and 0.69 (95% CI: -1.14 to -0.24) hours earlier out-of-bed time, 0.92 (95% CI: -1.41 to -0.42) hours earlier M10 and 0.96 (95% CI: -1.42 to -0.49) min earlier L5 midpoint. The results did not change substantially with further adjustment for total activity. There was a significant interaction between morning chronotype and first eating episode with rest-activity patterns (p < 0.05), with first eating episode associating with timing of activities only in non-morning type adults. Timing of zeitgebers was associated with sleep and rest-activity patterns, including bedtimes, L5 and M10 midpoint. Future research should evaluate the impact of manipulating zeitgebers on both circadian rhythms and health outcomes.",Zeitgebers and their association with rest-activity patterns.
"Exposure to the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) is ubiquitous and associated with health abnormalities that persist in subsequent generations. However, transgenerational effects of BPA on metabolic health are not widely studied. In a maternal C57BL/6J mice (F0) exposure model using BPA doses that are relevant to human exposure levels (10 mug/kg/day, LowerB; 10 mg/kg/day, UpperB), we showed male- and dose-specific effects on pancreatic islets of the first (F1) and second generation (F2) offspring relative to controls (7% corn oil diet; control). In this study, we determined the transgenerational effects (F3) of BPA on metabolic health and pancreatic islets in our model. Adult F3 LowerB and UpperB male offspring had increased body weight relative to Controls, however glucose tolerance was similar in the three groups. F3 LowerB, but not UpperB, males had reduced beta-cell mass and smaller islets which was associated with increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Similar to F1 and F2 BPA male offspring, staining for markers of T-cells and macrophages (CD3 and F4/80) was increased in pancreas of F3 LowerB and UpperB male offspring, which was associated with changes in cytokine levels. In contrast to F3 BPA males, LowerB and UpperB female offspring had comparable body weight, glucose tolerance and insulin secretion as Controls. Thus, maternal BPA exposure resulted in fewer metabolic defects in F3 than F1 and F2 offspring, and these were sex- and dose-specific.",Transgenerational effects of maternal bisphenol: a exposure on offspring metabolic health.

"BACKGROUND: We evaluated and compared the effects of sparsentan, a dual endothelin type A (ETA) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, with those of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist irbesartan in patients with primary FSGS. METHODS: In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, active-control Efficacy and Safety of Sparsentan (RE-021), a Dual Endothelin Receptor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker, in Patients with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS): A Randomized, Double-blind, Active-Control, Dose-Escalation Study (DUET), patients aged 8-75 years with biopsy-proven FSGS, eGFR>30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UP/C) >/=1.0 g/g received sparsentan (200, 400, or 800 mg/d) or irbesartan (300 mg/d) for 8 weeks, followed by open-label sparsentan only. End points at week 8 were reduction from baseline in UP/C (primary) and proportion of patients achieving FSGS partial remission end point (FPRE) (UP/C: </=1.5 g/g and >40% reduction [secondary]). RESULTS: Of 109 patients randomized, 96 received study drugs and had baseline and week 8 UP/C measurements. Sparsentan-treated patients had greater reductions in UP/C than irbesartan-treated patients did when all doses (45% versus 19%; P=0.006) or the 400 and 800 mg doses (47% versus 19%; P=0.01) were pooled for analysis. The FSGS partial remission end point was achieved in 28% of sparsentan-treated and 9% of irbesartan-treated patients (P=0.04). After 8 weeks of treatment, BP was reduced with sparsentan but not irbesartan, and eGFR was stable with both treatments. Overall, the incidence of adverse events was similar between groups. Hypotension and edema were more common among sparsentan-treated patients but did not result in study withdrawals. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FSGS achieved significantly greater reductions in proteinuria after 8 weeks of sparsentan versus irbesartan. Sparsentan was safe and well tolerated.",DUET: A Phase 2 Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Sparsentan in Patients with FSGS.
"Pediatric feeding disorders (PFDs) lack a universally accepted definition. Feeding disorders require comprehensive assessment and treatment of 4 closely related, complementary domains (medical, psychosocial, and feeding skill-based systems and associated nutritional complications). Previous diagnostic paradigms have, however, typically defined feeding disorders using the lens of a single professional discipline and fail to characterize associated functional limitations that are critical to plan appropriate interventions and improve quality of life. Using the framework of the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health, a unifying diagnostic term is proposed: ""Pediatric Feeding Disorder"" (PFD), defined as impaired oral intake that is not age-appropriate, and is associated with medical, nutritional, feeding skill, and/or psychosocial dysfunction. By incorporating associated functional limitations, the proposed diagnostic criteria for PFD should enable practitioners and researchers to better characterize the needs of heterogeneous patient populations, facilitate inclusion of all relevant disciplines in treatment planning, and promote the use of common, precise, terminology necessary to advance clinical practice, research, and health-care policy.",Pediatric Feeding Disorder: Consensus Definition and Conceptual Framework.
"OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for decreased libido among women in the late reproductive years. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. Women aged 35 to 47 years identified through random digit dialing were prospectively followed for 4 years with serial hormone assays and standardized questionnaires. Mean hormone values, hormone trends over 4 years, and fluctuation in hormone levels were compared among women with and without a decrease in libido at the last assessment period. Total testosterone, dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, body mass index, psychosocial, and socioeconomic variables were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 326 women, 87 (27%) reported a decreased libido, whereas 239 (73%) did not. Participant-specific means for all hormone levels over the study period were similar among both groups. However, total testosterone fluctuation over the study was significantly different between groups. Women whose testosterone levels fluctuated from 3.8 to 21.5 ng/dL around a mean value of 9 ng/dL were four times more likely to report decreased libido compared with women with little fluctuation in testosterone [odds ratio (OR) 4.0; 95% CI, 1.6-10.0]. Depression (OR 3.4; 95%CI, 1.9-6.1), vaginal dryness (OR 3.5; 95%CI, 1.8-6.6), and children living at home (OR 1.4; 95%CI, 1.1-1.7) were also independently associated with decreased libido. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased libido in the late reproductive years is associated with a pronounced fluctuation in total testosterone over time. Other independent risk factors for decreased libido include vaginal dryness, depression, and living with children. Sexual dysfunction is a complex disorder, related to physiological and psychosocial factors, requiring further investigation.",Predictors of decreased libido in women during the late reproductive years.
"BACKGROUND: Implantable rib-based distraction devices have revolutionized the treatment of children with early onset scoliosis and thoracic insufficiency syndrome. Unfortunately, the need for multiple skin incisions and repeated surgeries in a fragile patient population creates considerable infection risk. In order to assess rates of infection for different incision locations and potential risk factors, we generated a prospectively collected database of patients treated with rib-based distraction devices. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of patients with thoracic insufficiency syndrome from various etiologies that our institution treated with rib-based distraction devices from 2013 to 2016. Surgery type (implantation, expansion, revision/removal), and surgeon adjudicated surgical site infection (SSI) were collected. For this study, we developed a novel, rib-based distraction device surgical site labeling system in which incisions could be labeled as either proximal or distal surgical exposure areas. Treating surgeons documented the operative site, procedure, and SSI site in real-time. RESULTS: A total of 166 unique patients underwent 670 procedures during the study period, producing 1537 evaluable surgical sites; 1299 proximal and 238 distal. Patients were 6.81+/-4.0 years of age on average. Forty-seven procedures documented SSIs (7.0%), while 40 (24.1%) patients experienced an infection. Analysis showed significant variation in the rate of infection between implantation, and expansion, and revision procedures, with implantation procedures having the highest infection rate at 13.1% (P<0.01). Infections occurred more frequently at distal sites than proximal ones (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our novel, surgeon-entered, prospective quality improvement database has identified distal surgical sites as being at higher risk for SSI than proximal ones. Further, rib-based distraction device implantation procedures were identified as being at a greater risk for SSI than expansion or revision procedures. We believe this data can lead to improved prevention measures, anticipatory guidance, and patient care.

The number of adult living donor transplants is increasing due to improved outcomes and increasing need. Advantages of LDLT include optimization of the timing of transplant, better organ quality, and lower rates of recipient mortality compared to staying on the wait list for deceased donor liver transplant. Donor safety remains the major focus when considering LDLT. Recent advancements have supported the increased use of LDLT to help decrease wait list death and improve long-term survival of transplant recipients.",Current Status of Living Donor Liver Transplantation in the United States.

"Drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is a major threat to global malaria control and elimination efforts. In Botswana, a southern African country approaching malaria elimination, P. falciparum molecular data are not available. Parasites were assessed through pollymerase chain reaction (PCR) for confirmation of positive rapid diagnostic tests, multiplicity of infection (MOI), and drug resistance markers among isolates from clinical uncomplicated malaria cases collected at health facilities. Of 211 dried blood spot samples selected for the study, 186 (88.2%) were PCR positive for P. falciparum. The mean MOI based on MSP1 genotyping was 2.3 and was not associated with age. A high prevalence of wild-type parasites for pfcrt and pfmdr1 was found, with a haplotype frequency (K76/N86) of 88.8% and 17.7% of the isolates having two copies of the pfmdr1 gene. For pfATPase6, all the parasites carried the wild-type S769 allele. Sequencing showed no evidence of non-synonymous mutations associated with reduced artemisinin derivative sensitivity in the P. falciparum k13 gene. In conclusion, we found that P. falciparum parasites in Botswana were mostly wild type for the drug resistance markers evaluated. Yet, there was a high rate of a molecular marker associated to reduced sensitivity to lumefantrine. Our results indicate the need for systematic drug efficacy surveillance to complement malaria elimination efforts.",Molecular Surveillance of Plasmodium falciparum Drug Resistance Markers in Clinical Samples from Botswana.
"INTRODUCTION: People who inject drugs (PWID) experience high HIV incidence and face significant barriers to engagement in HIV care and substance use treatment. Strategies for HIV treatment as prevention and substance use treatment present unique challenges in PWID that may vary regionally. Understanding differences in the risk structure for HIV transmission and disease progression among PWID is essential in developing and effectively targeting intervention strategies of HIV treatment as prevention. METHODS: We present a baseline analysis of HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 074, a two-arm, randomized controlled trial among PWID in Indonesia (n = 258), Ukraine (n = 457) and Vietnam (n = 439). HPTN 074 was designed to determine the feasibility, barriers and uptake of an integrated intervention combining health systems navigation and psychosocial counselling for the early engagement of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and substance use treatment for PWID living with HIV. Discordant PWID networks were enrolled, consisting of an HIV-positive index and their HIV-negative network injection partner(s). Among the enrolled cohort of 1154 participants (502 index participants and 652 network partners), we examine regional differences in the baseline risk structure, including sociodemographics, HIV and substance use treatment history, and injection and sexual risk behaviours. RESULTS: The majority of participants were male (87%), with 82% of the enrolled females coming from Ukraine. The overall mean age was 34 (IQR: 30, 38). Most commonly injected substances included illegally manufactured methadone in Ukraine (84.2%), and heroin in Indonesia (81.8%) and Vietnam (99.5%). Injection network sizes varied by region: median number of people with whom participants self-reported injecting drugs was 3 (IQR: 2, 5) in Indonesia, 5 (IQR: 3, 10) in Ukraine and 3 (IQR: 2, 4) in Vietnam. Hazardous alcohol use, assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Alcohol Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C), was prominent in Ukraine (54.7%) and Vietnam (26.4%). Reported sexual risk behaviours in the past month, including having two or more sex partners and giving/receiving money or drugs in exchange for sex, were uncommon among all participants and regions. CONCLUSIONS: While regional differences in risk structure exist, PWID particularly in Ukraine need immediate attention for risk reduction strategies. Substantial regional differences in risk structure will require flexible, tailored treatment as prevention interventions for distinct PWID populations.",Regional differences between people who inject drugs in an HIV prevention trial integrating treatment and prevention (HPTN 074): a baseline analysis.
"Vertical mandibular distraction results in translation of both proximal and distal segments. The force exerted on the condylar segment not only places unwanted force on the joint but also rotates the coronoid process into the cranial base. To prevent these sequelae, we investigate the use of a ""check plate"" on the condylar segment in an attempt to decrease force at the Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and prevent unwanted rotation of the coronoid. Patients with hemifacial microsomia, seen at our Children's Hospital from 2012 to 2016 having undergone unilateral vertical mandibular distraction with placement of check plate were compared with a sample of those similarly having undergone distraction without use of the plate. Preoperative and postoperative cephalometric measures and 3-dimensional computed tomography imaging were analyzed. Three subjects were identified in each group. Age and Pruzansky-Kaban classification did not differ between groups. Vertical distance from the coronoid process perpendicular to the Frankfort Horizontal did not differ between groups (P < 0.07); however, postoperative distance significantly differed with the coronoid process rotating upward into the cranial base in subjects without a check plate (P < 0.005). Preoperative angle of the coronoid process based on the Frankfort Horizontal did not differ (P < 0.06); however, postoperative angle significantly changed, confirming upward rotation into the cranial base (P < 0.01). Total regenerate did not differ (P < 0.08). Vertical mandibular distraction results in undesirable upward rotation of the proximal segment into the cranial base and superior displacement of regenerate. This can be prevented with the use of a check plate.",Balancing Distraction Forces in the Mandible: Newton's Third Law of Distraction.
"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects motor neurons. Dominant mutations in the RNA binding protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) have been identified as causative factors of ALS. Mutation, R495X, results in a premature stop codon and induces an aggressive disease phenotype by a largely unknown process. Here, we employ CLIP-Seq, RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq in cultured neurons expressing R495X or wild-type FUS to identify the mutation effects on the FUS targetome and on the neuronal transcriptome at the expression and translation level, simultaneously. We report that, unlike wild-type FUS that binds on precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), R495X binds mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm. R495X has a moderate effect on target mRNA expression and its binding induces only modest expression changes. In contrast, we find that R495X controls the translation of genes that are associated with mitochondria function and results in significant reduction of mitochondrial size. Importantly, we show that introduction of the 4FL mutation that alters binding of R495X to RNA, partially abrogates R495X-induced effects on mRNA translation, mitochondrial size and neurotoxicity. Our findings uncover a novel RNA-mediated pathway of FUS R495X-induced neurotoxicity that affects mitochondria morphology and provide insight to previous studies associating mitochondria dysfunction to ALS.",Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis associated FUS mutation shortens mitochondria and induces neurotoxicity.
"Cognitive change affecting patients after anaesthesia and surgery has been recognised for more than 100 yr. Research into cognitive change after anaesthesia and surgery accelerated in the 1980s when multiple studies utilised detailed neuropsychological testing for assessment of cognitive change after cardiac surgery. This body of work consistently documented decline in cognitive function in elderly patients after anaesthesia and surgery, and cognitive changes have been identified up to 7.5 yr afterwards. Importantly, other studies have identified that the incidence of cognitive change is similar after non-cardiac surgery. Other than the inclusion of non-surgical control groups to calculate postoperative cognitive dysfunction, research into these cognitive changes in the perioperative period has been undertaken in isolation from cognitive studies in the general population. The aim of this work is to develop similar terminology to that used in cognitive classifications of the general population for use in investigations of cognitive changes after anaesthesia and surgery. A multispecialty working group followed a modified Delphi procedure with no prespecified number of rounds comprised of three face-to-face meetings followed by online editing of draft versions.Two major classification guidelines [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) and National Institute for Aging and the Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA)] are used outside of anaesthesia and surgery, and may be useful for inclusion of biomarkers in research. For clinical purposes, it is recommended to use the DSM-5 nomenclature. The working group recommends that 'perioperative neurocognitive disorders' be used as an overarching term for cognitive impairment identified in the preoperative or postoperative period. This includes cognitive decline diagnosed before operation (described as neurocognitive disorder); any form of acute event (postoperative delirium) and cognitive decline diagnosed up to 30 days after the procedure (delayed neurocognitive recovery) and up to 12 months (postoperative neurocognitive disorder).",Recommendations for the Nomenclature of Cognitive Change Associated with Anaesthesia and Surgery-20181.

"The early postnatal course for a newborn with critical congenital heart disease (CHD) can be negatively impacted if diagnosis is delayed. Despite this, there continues to be inconsistent evidence regarding potential benefits associated with prenatal diagnosis (PND) in neonates who undergo cardiac surgery. The objective of this study was to better define the impact of a PND on pre-operative morbidity by utilizing a large clinical database. Neonates (< 30 days) undergoing heart surgery from 2010 to 2014 and entered in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS-CHSD) were included. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between PND and a composite measure including nine major pre-operative risk factors. Co-variates were included to adjust for important patient characteristics (e.g., weight-for-age z-score, genetic syndromes, prematurity), case complexity, and center effects. Centers and patients with excess missing data for relevant co-variates were excluded. Included were 12,899 neonates undergoing surgery at 112 centers. Major pre-operative risk factors were present in 34% overall. By univariate analysis, PND was associated with a lower overall prevalence of major pre-operative risk factors. After adjusting for potential confounders, major pre-operative risk factors were less prevalent among neonates with PND compared to neonates without PND (adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.57-0.68, p < 0.001). A sensitivity analysis excluding neonates with genetic syndromes, non-cardiac anatomic abnormalities, and prematurity demonstrated similar findings (adjusted OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.49-0.61, p < 0.0001). Among neonates with CHD, prenatal diagnosis is associated with significantly lower rates of pre-operative risk factors for cardiac surgery. Further studies are needed to define association of these pre-operative benefits of a PND with longer term clinical outcomes.",Prenatal Diagnosis Influences Preoperative Status in Neonates with Congenital Heart Disease: An Analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database.
"RATIONALE: Current prevalence estimates of synthetic cathinone (""bath salt"") use may be underestimates given that traditional metrics (e.g., surveys, urinalysis) often fail to capture the emergent issue of synthetic cathinone adulteration of more common illegal drugs, such as ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). OBJECTIVES: This review examines the evolution of synthetic cathinones and prevalence of use over the past decade in the United States. We also review methods of self-report and biological testing of these compounds as well as adverse outcomes associated with adulterated drug use. RESULTS: Synthetic cathinone use emerged in the United States by 2009 with use associated with tens of thousands of poisonings. Reported poisonings and self-reported use have substantially decreased over the past five years. However, our review suggests that current estimates of use are underestimates due to underreporting stemming primarily from unknown or unintentional use of adulterated formulations of relatively popular illegal drugs, such as ecstasy. CONCLUSIONS: While intentional synthetic cathinone use has decreased in recent years, evidence suggests that prevalence of use is underestimated. Testing of drugs and/or biological specimens can improve the accuracy of synthetic cathinone use estimates. Furthermore, we advocate that researchers and clinicians should become better aware that exposure to these potent compounds (e.g., as adulterants) often occurs unknowingly or unintentionally. To improve our understanding of synthetic cathinone adulteration, research utilizing a combinatorial approach (survey and biological testing) will help more accurately estimate the prevalence and impact of this public health issue.",Synthetic cathinone adulteration of illegal drugs.
"One assessment of embodiment is the rubber hand illusion (RHI), a visuo-tactile illusion in which individuals attribute a sense of ownership to a rubber hand and disownership to their real hand. Interestingly, interoception seems to influence RHI susceptibility. In this study, we administered the RHI and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) to examine embodiment experiences and interoceptive awareness in experienced meditators (n=15) and non-meditators (n=15). We found that meditators reported less intensity in rubber hand ownership, but there was no significant difference between groups with respect to disownership of their real hand or drift in finger proprioception. Moreover, we found, from our MAIA results, that disownership experiences were associated with a feeling of trusting one's body in non-meditators and with the ability to maintain attention to unpleasant bodily sensations in meditators. These results suggest a unique relationship between interoceptive awareness and embodiment related to meditation.",Comparing embodiment experiences in expert meditators and non-meditators using the rubber hand illusion.
"BACKGROUND: By now, two-dimensional contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography (ceVUS) has become a well-established method for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of vesicoureteral reflux in children, particularly after the recent approval for this application in children in the USA and in Europe. The introduction of three-dimensional static (3D) and real-time (4D) techniques with ultrasound contrast agents opens up new diagnostic opportunities for this imaging modality. OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether 3D and 4D ceVUS is a superior technique compared to standard 2D ceVUS in diagnosing vesicoureteral reflux in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 150 patients (mean age 3.7 years) who underwent 2D and 3D/4D ceVUS for the diagnosis and grading of vesicoureteral reflux. RESULTS: 2D ceVUS and 3D/4D ceVUS diagnosed the same number of vesicoureteral refluxes, however, there was a statistically significant difference in grading between the two methods. Performing 3D/4D ceVUS resulted in changing the initial grade compared to 2D ceVUS in 19 out of 107 refluxing units (17.76%) diagnosed. The 4D technique enabled a more conspicuous visualization of vesicoureteral reflux than the 3D technique. CONCLUSIONS: 2D ceVUS and 3D/4D ceVUS diagnosed the same number of vesicoureteral refluxes, however, there was a statistically significant difference in grading between the two methods. Thus 3D/4D ceVUS appears at least a valid, if not even a more conspicuous technique compared to 2D ceVUS.",3D/4D contrast-enhanced urosonography (ceVUS) in children - is it superior to the 2D technique?
"Oral cancer has a high annual incidence rate all over the world, and the tongue is the most frequently affected anatomic structure. The current standard care is ablative surgery of malignant neoplasm, followed by tongue reconstruction with free flap. However, such reconstructive modalities with postsurgery radiotherapy or chemotherapy can hardly support the functional recovery of the tongue-particularly, functional taste bud regeneration-in reconstructed areas, thus seriously affecting patients' prognosis and life quality. Using a critical-sized tongue defect model in rats, we show that combinatory transplantation of small intestinal submucosa-extracellular matrix (SIS-ECM) with gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) or their derivative exosomes promoted tongue lingual papillae recovery and taste bud regeneration as evidenced by increased expression of CK14, CK8, and markers for type I, II, and III taste bud cells (NTPdase 2, PLC-beta2, and AADC, respectively). In addition, our results indicate that GMSCs or their derivative exosomes could increase BDNF expression, a growth factor that plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of epithelial basal progenitor cells into taste bud cells. Meanwhile, we showed an elevated expression level of Shh-which is essential for development, homeostasis, and maintenance of the taste bud organ-in wounded areas of the tongue among animals treated with GMSC/SIS-ECM or exosome/SIS-ECM as compared with SIS-ECM control. Moreover, our data show that GMSCs or their derivative exosomes promoted innervation of regenerated taste buds, as evidenced by elevated expressions of neurofilament and P2X3 at the injury areas. Together, our findings indicate that GMSC/SIS-ECM and exosome/SIS-ECM constructs can facilitate taste bud regeneration and reinnervation with promising potential application in postsurgery tongue reconstruction of patients with tongue cancer.",SIS-ECM Laden with GMSC-Derived Exosomes Promote Taste Bud Regeneration.
"OBJECTIVE: Recently developed advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have the potential to compensate for teen driving errors and reduce overall crash risk. To date, very limited research has been conducted on the suitability of ADAS for teen drivers-the population most likely to benefit from such systems. The opportunity for ADAS to reduce the frequency and severity of crashes involving teen drivers is hindered when there is a lack of trust, acceptance, and use of those technologies. Therefore, there is a need to study teen and parent perceptions of ADAS to help identify and overcome any potential barriers to ADAS use. METHODS: A U.S. national survey was developed based on themes from previously conducted teen and parent ADAS focus groups. Survey topics included trust in ADAS, effect of ADAS on teen driver safety and driving behavior, effect of ADAS on skill development, data privacy, and cybersecurity. Responses included 5-point Likert scales and open-ended questions. The survey was managed through an online respondent panel by ResearchNow. Eligibility criteria included licensed teens (16-19 years) and parents of licensed teens. Teen and parent responses were compared using chi-square statistics in SAS 9.4. RESULTS: Two thousand and three (teens = 1,000; parents = 1,003) respondents qualified for and completed the survey between September 1 and September 20, 2017. Overall, teens (72%) and parents (61%) felt that ADAS would have a positive impact on transportation. However, teens were more likely to exhibit a positive outlook on ADAS, whereas parents were more likely to have a negative outlook (P < .01). Teens felt that ADAS would be useful during bad weather or drowsy driving but were less concerned than parents about ADAS intervention during their own risky driving (P < .01). The majority of teens (65%) and parents (71%) agreed that teens should learn to drive on vehicles without ADAS, with parents being more likely to agree than teens (P < .01). Parents (55%) were more likely than teens (47%) to be concerned about insurance companies keeping track of teen driving data (P < .01). Most respondents exhibited some concern of ADAS being susceptible to hacking (57%). CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first effort to quantify ADAS perceptions among teen drivers and their parents at the U.S. national level. These data highlight potential barriers to ADAS use among teen drivers, including a relative disinterest among teens for ADAS intervention during risky driving as well as concerns among both teens and parents that ADAS will inhibit skill development. These survey findings will help inform educational programs to accelerate fleet turnover and provide the foundation for ADAS optimization and evaluation studies among sociodemographic groups.",Advanced driver assistance systems for teen drivers: A national survey of teen and parent perceptions.
"Alternative radiolabeled, targeted agents are being investigated for children with relapsed neuroblastoma (NB) who do not respond to I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) therapy. (DOTA-Tyr)-octreotate targets somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), particularly SSTR2, which are expressed on NB cells. We investigated SSTR2 expression in NB tumors (36 high-risk [HR]; 33 non-HR patients) and correlated SSTR2 levels with clinical features, norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression, and MIBG avidity. SSTR2 and NET immunohistochemistry scores (0 to 3) were calculated on biopsies using digital image analysis based on staining intensity and distribution. Clinical data were correlated with SSTR2 expression. Median SSTR2 score for 69 patients was 1.31 (0.26 to 2.55). Non-HR NB was associated with a higher SSTR2 score (P=0.032). The SSTR2 expression did not correlate with age, International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stage, MYCN amplification and histology. Higher SSTR2 scores were observed in MIBG-avid versus MIBG-nonavid NB. SSTR2 score was not significantly associated with NET score (r=-0.062, P=0.62). Twenty-six patients who relapsed or progressed had a median SSTR2 score of 1.33 (0.26 to 2.55). Patients with NB including relapsed or progressive disease showed SSTR2 expression at diagnosis, suggesting they could be candidates for radiolabeled-DOTA-conjugated peptide imaging or therapy.",Prevalence and Clinical Correlations of Somatostatin Receptor-2 (SSTR2) Expression in Neuroblastoma.

"TET enzymes convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and higher oxidized derivatives. TETs stably associate with and are post-translationally modified by the nutrient-sensing enzyme OGT, suggesting a connection between metabolism and the epigenome. Here, we show for the first time that modification by OGT enhances TET1 activity in vitro. We identify a TET1 domain that is necessary and sufficient for binding to OGT and report a point mutation that disrupts the TET1-OGT interaction. We show that this interaction is necessary for TET1 to rescue hematopoetic stem cell production in tet mutant zebrafish embryos, suggesting that OGT promotes TET1's function during development. Finally, we show that disrupting the TET1-OGT interaction in mouse embryonic stem cells changes the abundance of TET2 and 5-methylcytosine, which is accompanied by alterations in gene expression. These results link metabolism and epigenetic control, which may be relevant to the developmental and disease processes regulated by these two enzymes.",OGT binds a conserved C-terminal domain of TET1 to regulate TET1 activity and function in development.

"PURPOSE: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued three safety announcements between January 2009 and October 2010 warning against concomitant use of clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) due to a potential drug-drug interaction that may attenuate clopidogrel's antiplatelet activity. This primary objective of this study was to examine trends in concomitant clopidogrel/PPI use among acute coronary syndrome (ACS) inpatients in the US between 2000 and 2016, in relation to the FDA safety communications. METHODS: Adult inpatients with a primary diagnosis of ACS were identified from the Cerner Health Facts(R) database. The standardized (age, sex, race, and census region) prevalence of clopidogrel use with PPIs was calculated yearly and quarterly. Findings were stratified by PPIs' potential to inhibit clopidogrel's activity and by age. RESULTS: A total of 204,533 inpatients were identified. In 2008, the prevalence of concomitant clopidogrel and PPI treatment was 34.9%, decreasing to 24.4 and 16.4% in 2009 and 2010, respectively, with the decline being similar across age groups. Treatment with inhibiting PPIs (omeprazole and esomeprazole) and clopidogrel has continued to decrease since 2010, with a prevalence of 0.8% in 2016. A similar reduction was not observed with clopidogrel and non-inhibiting PPIs (pantoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and dexlansoprazole). During the FDA warning period, the combined treatment with clopidogrel and H2 receptor antagonists, an alternative to PPIs suggested by the FDA, temporarily increased from 7.8% in 2008 to 12.8 and 14.5% in 2009 and 2010, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that clinical practice recommendations made by the FDA were followed. Further research is needed to determine how changes in drug labels and the availability of new drugs may have influenced the observed trends.","Trends in concomitant clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitor treatment among ACS inpatients, 2000-2016."
"Background Full disclosure of patient safety events (PSE) is desired by patients and their families, is required by the Joint Commission and many state laws, and is vital to improving patient outcomes. A key barrier to consistent disclosure of patient safety events is a self-reported lack of proper training. Physicians must be trained to recognize when a PSE has occurred and effectively carry out disclosure, all while caring for a patient who is actively experiencing the consequences of an unintended outcome. Immersive simulation provides the opportunity to practice this complex skill. Objective To develop and evaluate a simulation-based workshop for pediatric residents on the disclosure of patient safety events. Methods A workshop in PSE disclosure was developed according to literature review, expert consultation, and feedback from hospital administration. The three-hour workshop included a simulated PSE with a subsequent standardized debriefing, interactive didactic session, and additional simulation-based hands-on practice in disclosure. Participants completed an anonymous survey at one-week and three-months post workshop, assessing workshop satisfaction, subsequent clinical experience, and perceived change to their practice. Results During the one-year study period, 27/31 (87.0%) second year residents completed the workshop. At the one-week follow-up, all study participants reported increased confidence and preparedness in their ability to lead the initial disclosure conversation. All study participants felt that the simulated scenarios were realistic and relevant to their current clinical duties and 33.3% (n=9) stated that they would like to repeat this workshop prior to completion of their training. At the three-month follow-up, 29.6% (N=8) of study participants reported involvement in the disclosure of a patient safety event since the workshop with all eight reporting feeling adequately prepared by the workshop for this experience. Study participants indicated that post training they were more likely to engage the attending physician, risk management and patient relations in the disclosure conversation (p <=0.05). The estimated cost of this simulation training for 27 residents was $6,993, not accounting for the 39 hours per clinician facilitator. Conclusions Immersive simulation is uniquely suited for teaching difficult conversation skills that are encountered during acute care, including the disclosure of patient safety events. While hands-on practice is critical, faculty and simulation resources required for continued implementation may not be sustainable long-term. Future training curricula should leverage creative and innovative adult-learning techniques to reach a wide range of members of the care team with less resource utilization.",Using Immersive Simulation to Engage Pediatric Residents in Difficult Conversations and the Disclosure of Patient Safety Events.
"Although neutrophils have been linked to the formation of the pre-metastatic niche, the mechanism of their migration to distant, uninvolved tissues has remained elusive. We report that bone marrow neutrophils from mice with early-stage cancer exhibited much more spontaneous migration than that of control neutrophils from tumor-free mice. These cells lacked immunosuppressive activity but had elevated rates of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, and increased production of ATP, relative to that of control neutrophils. Their enhanced spontaneous migration was mediated by autocrine ATP signaling through purinergic receptors. In ectopic tumor models and late stages of cancer, bone marrow neutrophils demonstrated potent immunosuppressive activity. However, these cells had metabolic and migratory activity indistinguishable from that of control neutrophils. A similar pattern of migration was observed for neutrophils and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells from patients with cancer. These results elucidate the dynamic changes that neutrophils undergo in cancer and demonstrate the mechanism of neutrophils' contribution to early tumor dissemination.",Unique pattern of neutrophil migration and function during tumor progression.
"Brainstem locus ceruleus neurons (LCn) are among the first neurons across the lifespan to evidence tau pathology, and LCn are implicated in tau propagation throughout the cortices. Yet, events influencing LCn tau are poorly understood. Activated persistently across wakefulness, LCn experience significant metabolic stress in response to chronic short sleep (CSS). Here we explored whether CSS influences LCn tau and the biochemical, neuroanatomical, and/or behavioral progression of tauopathy in male and female P301S mice. CSS in early adult life advanced the temporal progression of neurobehavioral impairments and resulted in a lasting increase in soluble tau oligomers. Intriguingly, CSS resulted in an early increase in AT8 and MC1 tau pathology in the LC. Over time tau pathology, including tangles, was evident in forebrain tau-vulnerable regions. Sustained microglial and astrocytic activation was observed as well. Remarkably, CSS resulted in significant loss of neurons in the two regions examined: the basolateral amygdala and LC. A second, distinct form of chronic sleep disruption, fragmentation of sleep, during early adult life also increased tau deposition and imparted early neurobehavioral impairment. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that early life sleep disruption has important lasting effects on the temporal progression in P301S mice, influencing tau pathology and hastening neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and neurobehavioral impairments.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Chronic short sleep (CSS) is pervasive in modern society. Here, we found that early life CSS influences behavioral, biochemical, and neuroanatomic aspects of the temporal progression of tauopathy in a mouse model of the P301S tau mutation. Specifically, CSS hastened the onset of motor impairment and resulted in a greater loss of neurons in both the locus ceruleus and basolateral/lateral amygdala. Importantly, despite a protracted recovery opportunity after CSS, mice evidenced a sustained increase in pathogenic tau oligomers, and increased pathogenic tau in the locus ceruleus and limbic system nuclei. These findings unveil early life sleep habits as an important determinant in the progression of tauopathy.",Chronic Sleep Disruption Advances the Temporal Progression of Tauopathy in P301S Mutant Mice.
"BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders are under-detected and not systematically diagnosed or screened for by primary care. In this study, we present the acceptability and validity of an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) designed to screen tobacco and alcohol use disorder, in individuals who did not seek medical help for these disorders. METHODS: Individuals were included from June 2016 to May 2017 in the Outpatient Sleep Clinic of the University Hospital of Bordeaux. DSM-5 diagnoses of tobacco and alcohol use disorders were assessed by human interviewers. The ECA interview integrated items from the Cigarette Dependence Scale-5 (CDS-5) for tobacco use disorder screening, and the ""Cut Down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener"" (CAGE) questionnaire for alcohol use disorder screening. Paper version of CDS-5 and CAGE questionnaires and acceptability questionnaire was also self-administered. RESULTS: Of the 139 participants in the study (mean age 43.0 [SD = 13.7] years), 71 were women, and 68 were men. The ECA was well accepted by the patients. Paper self-administered CDS-5 and CAGE scores had a strong agreement with the ECA (p < 0.0001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis of the ECA interview showed AUC of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-1.0) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69-0.98) for CDS-5 and CAGE respectively with p-value <0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: This ECA was acceptable and valid to screen tobacco or alcohol use disorder among patients not requesting treatment for addiction. The ECA could be used in hospitals and potentially in primary care settings to help clinicians to better screen their patients for alcohol and tobacco use disorders.",Development and validation of a virtual agent to screen tobacco and alcohol use disorders.

"Closing-in behavior (CIB) is observed in copying tasks (graphic or gestural) when the copy is performed near or on the top of the model. This symptom has been classically considered to be a manifestation of constructional apraxia and is often associated with a visuospatial impairment. More recent work emphasizes the attentional and/or executive nature of the behavior and its association with frontal lobe dysfunction. We describe three patients in whom CIB was associated with posterior parietal deficits of different etiologies (stroke in Patient 1 and dementia in Patients 2 and 3). In copying figures, Patient 1 produced the shape with high accuracy but the rendering overlapped the model, while for Patients 2 and 3 the copies were distorted but overlapping or in close proximity to the target. In gesture imitation, Patient 2 performed the gestures toward the examiner's space, while Patient 1 showed a peculiar form of CIB: when he was asked to place the ipsilesional arm in a position that mirrored the contralesional hand, Patient 1 moved his hand toward his contralesional hand. Patient 3 did not present gestural CIB. While CIB in Patient 1 was associated with selective deficits in executive functions and attention, additional visuospatial deficits were observed in Patients 2 and 3. The latter two patients showed a general visuoconstructional deficit. These case studies support a primary attentional account of CIB but also suggest that visuoconstructional impairments may contribute to the emergence of CIB, in some subjects. This evidence argues for different types of CIB with different cognitive and neural underpinnings. Furthermore, the data support the hypothesis of a differential involvement of fronto-parietal network in CIB.",Closing-in Behavior and Parietal Lobe Deficits: Three Single Cases Exhibiting Different Manifestations of the Same Behavior.
"OBJECTIVES: There are no population-based estimates of the incidence or risk factors for acute cardiac manifestations in children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to guide screening and diagnostic imaging practices. We estimated the incidence and prevalence of acute cardiac manifestations of child-onset SLE compared to adult-onset SLE and identified factors associated with cardiac diagnoses. METHODS: We identified children (5-17 years) and adults (18-64 years) with incident SLE (>/=3 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) code 710.0, > 30 days apart) using Clinformatics(R) DataMart (OptumInsight, Eden Prairie, MN) deidentified United States administrative claims (2000-2013). We calculated incidence and prevalence of three outcomes: >/= 1 diagnosis code for (1) pericarditis and/or myocarditis, (2) endocarditis, or (3) valvular insufficiency. Negative binomial regression was used to identify characteristics associated with cardiac diagnoses in children and determine whether SLE onset in childhood vs adulthood was independently associated with cardiac involvement. RESULTS: There were 297 children and 6927 adults with new-onset SLE. A total of 17.8% of children had ICD-9 CM codes for acute cardiac diagnoses, the incidence of which were highest in the first year after SLE diagnosis (12.2 per 100 person-years). African American race (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 6.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) (2.9, 15.0), p < 0.01) and nephritis (IRR 7.0, 95% CI (2.6, 18.6), p < 0.01) were associated with acute cardiac diagnoses in children. Child-onset disease was independently associated with a 4.4-fold higher rate of pericarditis or myocarditis compared to adult-onset SLE after adjustment for other disease and demographic characteristics (95% CI (2.4, 8.0), p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This study establishes baseline estimates of the incidence and prevalence of pericarditis and myocarditis in child-onset SLE, which is substantially higher than that of adult-onset SLE. Prospective echocardiographic evaluations are needed to validate incidence measures and characterize the natural history of acute cardiac manifestations in child-onset SLE, as well as identify risk factors for poor cardiac outcomes to inform screening and management.",Child-onset systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with a higher incidence of myopericardial manifestations compared to adult-onset disease.

"OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of Spanish versions of the Survey of Well-being of Young Children (SWYC) Milestones and the Ages & Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ-3), and to document the rates of developmental delays in an urban cohort of children with Hispanic parents. METHODS: Spanish-speaking families with a child 9 to 60 months of age (N=991) were initially screened using Spanish translations of the SWYC Milestones and the ASQ-3. A stratified random sample of 494 of these children subsequently received standardized clinical assessment to confirm the presence of developmental delays. Reverse weighting corrected for the selection bias inherent in the stratification scheme. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of toddlers (9 to 41 months of age) and 34.8% of preschoolers (42 to 60 months of age) scored in the moderately to severely delayed range, most frequently in language. Sensitivity and specificity for toddlers with severe delays associated with the SWYC were 0.69 and 0.64, respectively, and 0.55 and 0.75 for the ASQ-3. Sensitivity and specificity for preschoolers with severe delays associated with the SWYC were 0.87 and 0.58, respectively, and 0.71 and 0.86 for the ASQ-3. CONCLUSIONS: Although psychometric properties of the Spanish translated versions are not as strong as the English versions, the findings suggest that both the SWYC Milestones and ASQ-3 represent promising tools for identifying Hispanic children with developmental delays. The rate of delays were consistent with other studies showing a high percentage of Hispanic children with developmental delays, most frequently in language skills.",Psychometric Properties of Two Developmental Screening Instruments for Hispanic Children in the Philadelphia Region.
"The development of therapeutic cancer vaccines as a means to generate immune reactivity against tumors has been explored since the early discovery of tumor-specific antigens by Georg Klein in the 1960s. However, challenges including weak immunogenicity, systemic toxicity, and off-target effects of cancer vaccines remain as barriers to their broad clinical translation. Advances in the design and implementation of biomaterials are now enabling enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity of cancer vaccines by controlling the presentation and release of vaccine components to immune cells and their microenvironment. Here, we discuss the rational design and clinical status of several classes of cancer vaccines (including DNA, mRNA, peptide/protein, and cell-based vaccines) along with novel biomaterial-based delivery technologies that improve their safety and efficacy. Further, strategies for designing new platforms for personalized cancer vaccines are also considered.",Biomaterials for vaccine-based cancer immunotherapy.

"BACKGROUND: Rectal neuroendocrine tumors are often found incidentally. Local excision alone has been advocated for lesions </=2 cm; however, the evidence base for this approach is limited. OBJECTIVE: Associations among tumor size, degree of differentiation, and presence of distant metastatic disease were examined. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS: This study was conducted using a nationwide cohort. PATIENTS: A total of 4893 patients with rectal neuroendocrine tumors were identified in the National Cancer Database (2006-2015). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate associations among tumor size, degree of differentiation, and presence of regional and distant metastatic disease. Cut point analysis was performed to identify an optimal size threshold predictive of distant metastatic disease. RESULTS: Of patients included for analysis, 3880 (79.3%) had well-differentiated tumors, 540 (11.0%) had moderately differentiated tumors, and 473 (9.7%) had poorly differentiated tumors. On logistic regression, increasing size was associated with a higher likelihood of pathologically confirmed lymph node involvement (among patients undergoing proctectomy), and both size and degree of differentiation were independently associated with a higher likelihood of distant metastatic disease. The association between tumor size and distant metastatic disease was stronger for well-differentiated and moderately differentiated tumors (OR = 1.4; p < 0.001 for both) than for poorly differentiated tumors (OR = 1.1; p = 0.010). For well-differentiated tumors, the optimal cut point for the presence of distant metastatic disease was 1.15 cm (area under the curve = 0.88; 88% sensitive and 88% specific). Tumors >/=1.15 cm in diameter were associated with a substantially increased incidence of distant metastatic disease (72/449 (13.8%)). For moderately differentiated tumors, the optimal cut point was also 1.15 cm (area under the curve = 0.87, 100% sensitive and 75% specific). LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor size and degree of differentiation are predictive of regional and distant metastatic disease in rectal neuroendocrine tumors. Patients with tumors >1.15 cm are at substantial risk of distant metastasis and should be staged and managed accordingly.

"Muscles of the mesopelagic copepod Gaussia princeps (Arthropoda, Crustacea, Calanoida) are responsible for repetitive movements of feeding and swimming appendages that are too fast to be followed by eye. This article provides a comparative functional and ultrastructural description of five muscles that have different contraction speeds and are located within different anatomical sites. All are very fast, as indicated by a thick:thin filament ratio of 3:1 and sarcomere lengths that vary between 1 and 3 mum. Measured lengths of thin and thick filaments indicate classification of the muscles into three distinct groups (short, medium, and long) and predict a difference in speed of up to threefold between fibers with the shortest and longest sarcomeres. Indeed, the kicking movement of the posterior legs (with the shortest sarcomere length) is approximately threefold faster than the simultaneous back-folding of the antennae (with the longest length). Thus, a specific relationship between speed of movement and sarcomere length is established, and we can use the latter to predict the former. Regulatory systems of contraction (sarcoplasmic reticulum [SR] and transverse [T] tubules) match the different contractile properties, varying in frequency of distribution and overall content in parallel to sarcomere variations. All muscles from appendages and body musculature show a unique disposition of contractile material, SR, and T tubules found only in copepod muscles; muscle filaments are grouped in large supermyofibrils that are riddled with frequent cylindrical shafts containing SR and T tubules. This arrangement insures a high spatial frequency of regulatory components. Anat Rec, 301:2164-2176, 2018.

"Due to the high genetic heterogeneity of hearing loss (HL), current clinical testing includes sequencing large numbers of genes, which often yields a significant number of novel variants. Therefore, the standardization of variant interpretation is crucial to provide consistent and accurate diagnoses. The Hearing Loss Variant Curation Expert Panel was created within the Clinical Genome Resource to provide expert guidance for standardized genomic interpretation in the context of HL. As one of its major tasks, our Expert Panel has adapted the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants in HL genes. Here, we provide a comprehensive illustration of the newly specified ACMG/AMP HL rules. Three rules remained unchanged, four rules were removed, and the remaining 21 rules were specified. These rules were further validated and refined using a pilot set of 51 variants assessed by curators and disease experts. Of the 51 variants evaluated in the pilot, 37% (19/51) changed category based upon application of the expert panel specified rules and/or aggregation of evidence across laboratories. These HL-specific ACMG/AMP rules will help standardize variant interpretation, ultimately leading to better care for individuals with HL.",Expert specification of the ACMG/AMP variant interpretation guidelines for genetic hearing loss.
"PURPOSE: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections among children. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the antimicrobials used for febrile UTIs in paediatric clinical trials and meta-analyse the observed cure rates and reasons for treatment failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane central databases between January 1, 1990, and November 24, 2016, combining MeSH and free-text terms for: ""urinary tract infections"", AND ""therapeutics"", AND ""clinical trials"" in children (age range 0-18 years). Two independent reviewers assessed study quality and performed data extraction. The major outcome measures were clinical and microbiological cure rates according to different antibiotics. RESULTS: We identified 2762 published studies and included 30 clinical trials investigating 3913 cases of paediatric febrile urinary tract infections. Children with no underlying condition were the main population included in the trials (n = 2602; 66.5%). Cephalosporins were the most frequent antibiotics studied in trials (22/30, 73.3%). Only a few antibiotics active against resistant UTIs have been tested in randomised clinical trials, mainly aminoglycosides. The average point cure rate of all investigational drugs was estimated to 95.3% (95% CI 93.5-96.9%). Among 3002 patients for whom cure and failure rates were reported, only 3.9% (3.9%; 118/3002) were considered clinically to have treatment failure, while 135 (4.5%; 135/3002) had microbiological failure. CONCLUSIONS: We observed high treatment cure rates, regardless of the investigational drug chosen, the route of administration, duration and dosing. This suggests that future research should prioritise observational studies and clinical trials on children with multi-drug-resistant infections.",Antibiotics and Cure Rates in Childhood Febrile Urinary Tract Infections in Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
"TRPV5 is a transient receptor potential channel involved in calcium reabsorption. Here we investigate the interaction of two endogenous modulators with TRPV5. Both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and calmodulin (CaM) have been shown to directly bind to TRPV5 and activate or inactivate the channel, respectively. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined TRPV5 structures in the presence of dioctanoyl PI(4,5)P2 and CaM. The PI(4,5)P2 structure reveals a binding site between the N-linker, S4-S5 linker and S6 helix of TRPV5. These interactions with PI(4,5)P2 induce conformational rearrangements in the lower gate, opening the channel. The CaM structure reveals two TRPV5 C-terminal peptides anchoring a single CaM molecule and that calcium inhibition is mediated through a cation-pi interaction between Lys116 on the C-lobe of calcium-activated CaM and Trp583 at the intracellular gate of TRPV5. Overall, this investigation provides insight into the endogenous modulation of TRPV5, which has the potential to guide drug discovery.",Structural insights on TRPV5 gating by endogenous modulators.
"High-charge and -energy (HZE) particles comprise space radiation and they pose a challenge to astronauts on deep space missions. While exposure to most HZE particles decreases neurogenesis in the hippocampus-a brain structure important in memory-prior work suggests that (12)C does not. However, much about (12)C's influence on neurogenesis remains unknown, including the time course of its impact on neurogenesis. To address this knowledge gap, male mice (9(-)11 weeks of age) were exposed to whole-body (12)C irradiation 100 cGy (IRR; 1000 MeV/n; 8 kEV/microm) or Sham treatment. To birthdate dividing cells, mice received BrdU i.p. 22 h post-irradiation and brains were harvested 2 h (Short-Term) or three months (Long-Term) later for stereological analysis indices of dentate gyrus neurogenesis. For the Short-Term time point, IRR mice had fewer Ki67, BrdU, and doublecortin (DCX) immunoreactive (+) cells versus Sham mice, indicating decreased proliferation (Ki67, BrdU) and immature neurons (DCX). For the Long-Term time point, IRR and Sham mice had similar Ki67+ and DCX+ cell numbers, suggesting restoration of proliferation and immature neurons 3 months post-(12)C irradiation. IRR mice had fewer surviving BrdU+ cells versus Sham mice, suggesting decreased cell survival, but there was no difference in BrdU+ cell survival rate when compared within treatment and across time point. These data underscore the ability of neurogenesis in the mouse brain to recover from the detrimental effect of (12)C exposure.","Whole-Body (12)C Irradiation Transiently Decreases Mouse Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus Proliferation and Immature Neuron Number, but Does Not Change New Neuron Survival Rate."

"BACKGROUND: Infants born with critical congenital heart disease (cCHD) who require surgical intervention in the newborn period are often hospitalized in a cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). Cardiac surgery and the CICU environment are traumatic to infants and their families. Infants are exposed to overwhelming stress, which can result in increased pain, physiologic instability, behavioral disorganization, disrupted attachment, and altered brain development. Individualized Family-centered Developmental Care (IFDC) is a model that can address the unique needs and developmental challenges of infants with cCHD. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to (1) clearly describe the uniqueness of the infant with cCHD, including the medical, neurological, and parental challenges, and (2) propose methods to apply IFDC to support recovery of infants with cCHD in the CICU. CONCLUSIONS: The experiences in the CICU shape the developing brain and alter recovery and healing, thus adversely impacting development. Individualized Family-centered Developmental Care is a promising model of care that nurses can integrate into the CICU to promote neuroprotection and development. Nurses can effectively integrate IFDC into the CICU by understanding the unique characteristics of infants with cCHD and applying IFDC interventions that include both maturity and recovery perspectives. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The incorporation of IFDC interventions is essential for the infant with cCHD and should be a standard of care. Applying IFDC with a recovery perspective in all aspects of caregiving will provide opportunities for individualization of care and parent engagement, allowing infants in the CICU to recover from surgery while supporting both short- and long-term neurodevelopment.",Individualized Family-Centered Developmental Care: An Essential Model to Address the Unique Needs of Infants With Congenital Heart Disease.
"As part of the American Society of Anesthesiology Brain Health Initiative goal of improving perioperative brain health for older patients, over 30 experts met at the fifth International Perioperative Neurotoxicity Workshop in San Francisco, CA, in May 2016, to discuss best practices for optimizing perioperative brain health in older adults (ie, >65 years of age). The objective of this workshop was to discuss and develop consensus solutions to improve patient management and outcomes and to discuss what older adults should be told (and by whom) about postoperative brain health risks. Thus, the workshop was provider and patient oriented as well as solution focused rather than etiology focused. For those areas in which we determined that there were limited evidence-based recommendations, we identified knowledge gaps and the types of scientific knowledge and investigations needed to direct future best practice. Because concerns about perioperative neurocognitive injury in pediatric patients are already being addressed by the SmartTots initiative, our workshop discussion (and thus this article) focuses specifically on perioperative cognition in older adults. The 2 main perioperative cognitive disorders that have been studied to date are postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. Postoperative delirium is a syndrome of fluctuating changes in attention and level of consciousness that occurs in 20%-40% of patients >60 years of age after major surgery and inpatient hospitalization. Many older surgical patients also develop postoperative cognitive deficits that typically last for weeks to months, thus referred to as postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Because of the heterogeneity of different tools and thresholds used to assess and define these disorders at varying points in time after anesthesia and surgery, a recent article has proposed a new recommended nomenclature for these perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Our discussion about this topic was organized around 4 key issues: preprocedure consent, preoperative cognitive assessment, intraoperative management, and postoperative follow-up. These 4 issues also form the structure of this document. Multiple viewpoints were presented by participants and discussed at this in-person meeting, and the overall group consensus from these discussions was then drafted by a smaller writing group (the 6 primary authors of this article) into this manuscript. Of course, further studies have appeared since the workshop, which the writing group has incorporated where appropriate. All participants from this in-person meeting then had the opportunity to review, edit, and approve this final manuscript; 1 participant did not approve the final manuscript and asked for his/her name to be removed.",Best Practices for Postoperative Brain Health: Recommendations From the Fifth International Perioperative Neurotoxicity Working Group.
"Multidetector CT technology has advanced during the past 2 decades from single-digit numbers of sections to 320-section CT scanners. The ability to perform three-dimensional (3D) postprocessing of acquired data has accompanied this technical progress. Multiple considerations are involved in developing and deploying a 3D and advanced imaging laboratory to provide postprocessing for both CT and MRI examinations. Establishing and running a 3D laboratory requires administrators to buy into the process and also requires regular input from radiologists and other stakeholders. Technologists with prior 3D experience are rare, and extensive immersive training is typically required. Laboratory space and equipment must be maintained and updated regularly to continue to meet stakeholders' needs. Postprocessing protocols must be established and reviewed periodically. Quality control is also necessary to ensure that postprocessing outputs adhere to the protocols. Laboratory technologists can also provide postprocessing support for research examinations and can lend their technical expertise to research projects. Regular review of laboratory productivity is essential to ensure longevity and availability of necessary resources (human, environmental, and technical). As the technologies for the imaging equipment, the picture archiving and communication system, and postprocessing continue to advance, the role of the 3D laboratory will also evolve to include other services. This evolution will affect ongoing training of technologists, as well as the requirements when new technologists are hired. The 3D laboratory is often positioned to take on novel technology and augment radiologists' workflow as new modalities and techniques enter the clinical workflow.

"The immune system maintains a balance between protection and tolerance. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) function as a vital tolerance mechanism in the immune system to suppress effector immune cells. Additionally, Tregs can be utilized as a form of immunotherapy for autoimmune disorders. As T cells have previously been shown to exhibit sensitivity to the rigidity of an activating substrate upon activation via IL-2 secretion, we herein explore the previously unknown effect of substrate rigidity on the induction of Tregs from conventional naive mouse CD4(+) T cells. Substrates with modulatable rigidities ranging from a hundred kilopascals to a few megapascals were fabricated via poly(dimethylsiloxane). We found that there was a significant increase in Treg induction at lower substrate rigidities (i.e., E ~ 100 kPa) compared to higher rigidity levels (i.e., E ~ 3 MPa). To confirm that this significant difference in induction rate was truly related to T-cell mechanosensing, we administered compound Y-27632 to inhibit myosin contractility. In the presence of Y-27632, the myosin-based contractility was disrupted and, as a result, the difference in Treg induction caused by the substrate rigidity was abrogated. This study demonstrates that mechanosensing is involved in Treg induction and raises questions about the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in this process. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Triploidy is the presence of an extra haploid set of chromosomes and can exist in complete or mosaic form. The extra haploid set of chromosomes in triploid cells can be of maternal or paternal origin. Diploid/triploid mixoploidy is a unique form of triploid mosaicism that requires the aberrant segregation of entire parental genomes into distinct blastomere lineages (heterogoneic cell division) at the earliest zygotic divisions. Here we report on eight cases of diploid/triploid mixoploidy from our institution and conduct a comprehensive review of the literature. The parental origin of the extra set of chromosomes was determined in two cases; and, based on phenotypic evidence we propose the parental origin in the other cases. One case with complex mixoploidy appears to have a digynic origin in addition to the involvement of two different sperm. Of our eight cases, only one resulted in the birth of a live healthy child.

"This study assessed the role of the processes of change (POC), a construct of the transtheoretical model, in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among Latinos. Latinos participate in CRC screening less often and are diagnosed with CRC at a later stage than whites. POC items were administered to 344 English- and Spanish-speaking Latinos at average risk for CRC who had not had a colonoscopy in the past 5 years and received a colonoscopy referral. POC were measured at three timepoints: following informed consent (T1) at time of referral, 2 weeks prior to scheduled colonoscopy (T2), and 1 month after scheduled colonoscopy (T3). Participants received patient navigation as part of a randomized controlled trial to promote screening colonoscopy. POC scores were examined for changes during the course of the intervention, and logistic regression models assessed the relationship between POC scores and CRC screening adherence. Total POC scores decreased between T1 and T2 (p = 0.03) but were unchanged between T1 and T3. CRC screening adherence was not significantly associated with POC scores or change in POC scores over time. The POC instrument was not found useful for predicting colonoscopy adherence among Latinos in conjunction with patient navigation. Total POC scores did not increase during a patient navigation intervention despite high colonoscopy completion rates.",Processes of Change for Colonoscopy: Limited Support for Use Among Navigated Latinos.
"BACKGROUND: Anesthesiology has a long relationship with critical care medicine (CCM). However, US anesthesiologists are less likely to practice CCM than non-US anesthesiologists. To date, no studies have compared academic contributions in CCM between US anesthesiologists and non-US anesthesiologists. The objective of our study was to use recent trends in critical care publications as a surrogate for academic contribution among US and non-US anesthesiologists. METHODS: Research articles published between 2010 and 2015 in 3 anesthesiology journals (Anesthesiology, Anesthesia & Analgesia, and British Journal of Anaesthesia) and 3 multidisciplinary CCM journals (Critical Care Medicine, Intensive Care Medicine, and Journal of Critical Care) were reviewed. Author information, including the primary department appointment and geographic location for the first and senior author(s), and article details, including topic and publication type, were collected. Odds ratios for having a first or senior author from the United States were calculated. Anesthesiologists' contributions in individual journals were summarized, as were trends in anesthesiology CCM publications during the 6-year study period. RESULTS: A total of 3831 articles were reviewed, with 1050 (27.4%) having US authors. Eighty-two and one-half percent of CCM articles in anesthesiology journals had a US anesthesiologist as first author, and 81% had a US anesthesiologist as senior author, while fewer CCM articles in multidisciplinary journals had a US anesthesiologist as first (12.1%) or senior (12.3%) author. When considering all publications, 16.3% and 16.4% of articles had a US anesthesiologist as the first or senior author compared with articles for which non-US anesthesiologists were first (23.8%) or senior (20.9%) authors. The odds of having a US anesthesiologist as first or senior author compared to a non-US anesthesiologist for all publications were 0.6 (0.5-0.7) and 0.7 (0.6-0.9). The number of publications trended downward for both US anesthesiologists and non-US anesthesiologists during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to non-US anesthesiologists, US anesthesiologists had more CCM publications in anesthesiology journals and fewer publications in multidisciplinary CCM journals. The number of anesthesiology CCM publications decreased for both US and non-US anesthesiologists throughout the study period.",Contemporary Academic Contributions From Anesthesiologists in Adult Critical Care Medicine.
BACKGROUND: General anesthesia and sedation are used routinely for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in children to optimize image quality. Airway devices such as supraglottic airways (SGAs) can alter the appearance of cervical soft tissue regions on an MRI and increase the risk of misdiagnosis. This phenomenon has not been well described in vivo. AIMS: We conducted this retrospective study to determine how often SGAs affected the appearance of neck masses in children who received multiple anesthetics for MRIs with and without an SGA. METHODS: We retrieved data on children 17 years old and younger who had multiple MRIs between January 2005 and January 2015. Inclusion criteria were patients with neck masses who had a SGA for at least one MRI and either a natural airway or endotracheal tube (ETT) for another MRI. We reviewed MRI images and imaging reports to determine if SGAs affected the appearance of neck masses. RESULTS: Twelve of the 921 patients who received anesthesia for neck MRIs during the study period met the inclusion criteria. SGAs affected the appearance of the neck mass in 11 of the 12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Supraglottic airways can significantly alter the appearance of neck masses in children undergoing MRIs and affect radiologists' ability to assess those masses. Communication with the radiologist prior to the induction of anesthesia is crucial when using supraglottic devices in this patient population. It may be more prudent to use a different airway device and/or anesthetic technique when MRIs of these neck masses are undertaken.,A retrospective study of the impact of supraglottic airway devices on the appearance of neck masses in children undergoing serial magnetic resonance imaging.
"ImmuneDB is a system for storing and analyzing high-throughput immune receptor sequencing data. Unlike most existing tools, which utilize flat-files, ImmuneDB stores data in a well-structured MySQL database, enabling efficient data queries. It can take raw sequencing data as input and annotate receptor gene usage, infer clonotypes, aggregate results, and run common downstream analyses such as calculating selection pressure and constructing clonal lineages. Alternatively, pre-annotated data can be imported and analyzed data can be exported in a variety of common Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) file formats. To validate ImmuneDB, we compare its results to those of another pipeline, MiXCR. We show that the biological conclusions drawn would be similar with either tool, while ImmuneDB provides the additional benefits of integrating other common tools and storing data in a database.

"INTRODUCTION: This article discusses a blueprint for a sexual health communication curriculum to facilitate undergraduate medical student acquisition of sexual history taking skills and includes recommendations for important elements of a thorough sexual history script for undergraduate medical students. AIM: To outline the fundamentals, objectives, content, timing, and teaching methods of a gold standard curriculum in sexual health communication. METHODS: Consensus expert opinion was documented at the 2012, 2014, and 2016 Summits in Medical Education in Sexual Health. Additionally, the existing literature was reviewed regarding undergraduate medical education in sexual health. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: This article reports expert opinion and a review of the literature on the development of a sexual history taking curriculum. RESULTS: First-year curricula should be focused on acquiring satisfactory basic sexual history taking skills, including both assessment of sexual risk via the 5 Ps (partners, practices, protection from sexually transmitted infections, past history of sexually transmitted infections, and prevention of pregnancy) as well as assessment of sexual wellness-described here as a sixth P (plus), which encompasses the assessment of trauma, violence, sexual satisfaction, sexual health concerns/problems, and support for gender identity and sexual orientation. Second-year curricula should be focused on incorporating improved clinical reasoning, emphasizing sexual history taking for diverse populations and practices, and including the impact of illness on sexual health. Teaching methods must include varied formats. Evaluation may be best as a formative objective structured clinical examination in the first year and summative in the second year. Barriers for curriculum development may be reduced by identifying faculty champions of sexual health/medicine. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Medical students will improve their skills in sexual history taking, which will ultimately impact patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes. Future research is needed to validate this proposed curriculum and assess the impact on clinical skills. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: This article assimilates expert consensus and existing clinical guidelines to provide a novel structured approach to curriculum development in sexual health interviewing in the pre-clinical years. CONCLUSION: The blueprint for developing sexual history taking skills includes a spiral curriculum with varied teaching formats, incorporation of a sexual history script that incorporates inquiry about sexual wellness, and longitudinal assessment across the pre-clinical years. Ideally, sexual health communication content should be incorporated into existing clinical interviewing and physical examination courses. Rubin ES, Rullo J, Tsai P, et al.

"Prominent models of spike trains assume only one source of variability - stochastic (Poisson) spiking - when stimuli and behavior are fixed. However, spike trains may also reflect variability due to internal processes such as planning. For example, we can plan a movement at one point in time and execute it at some arbitrary later time. Neurons involved in planning may thus share an underlying time course that is not precisely locked to the actual movement. Here we combine the standard Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to account for shared temporal variability. When applied to recordings from macaque premotor cortex, we find that time warping considerably improves predictions of neural activity. We suggest that such temporal variability is a widespread phenomenon in the brain which should be modeled.",Linear-nonlinear-time-warp-poisson models of neural activity.
"Purpose of Review: Direct-acting antiviral regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) became available in 2014, and these highly curative therapies have the potential to reduce HCV-associated morbidity and mortality, decrease transmission, and eliminate HCV infection as a public health problem. This review summarizes the recommendations by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine for a US strategy for HCV elimination. Recent Findings: To achieve proposed targets of reducing HCV incidence by 90% and decreasing HCV-related mortality by 60% by 2030, there is a critical need to improve HCV diagnosis and linkage to care; reduce HCV-related disease by antiviral treatment scale-up; reduce HCV incidence; and strengthen HCV surveillance to determine achievement of HCV elimination targets over time. Summary: While HCV elimination is feasible, success of this national effort will require ongoing collaboration and critical resource investment by key stakeholders, including medical and public health communities, legislators, community organizers, and patient advocates.",Strategies for the elimination of hepatitis C virus infection as a public health threat in the United States.
"BACKGROUND: The proliferative phase of infantile hemangiomas (IHs) is usually complete by 9 months of life. Late growth beyond age 3 years is rarely reported. OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographic and clinic characteristics of a cohort of patients with late growth of IH, defined as growth in a patient >3 years of age. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: In total, 59 patients, 85% of which were female, met the inclusion criteria. The mean first episode of late growth was 4.3 (range 3-8.5) years. Head and neck location (55/59; 93%) and presence of deep hemangioma (52/59; 88%) were common characteristics. Posterior fossa malformations, hemangiomas, arterial anomalies, cardiac defects, eye abnormalities (PHACE) syndrome was noted in 20 of 38 (53%) children with segmental facial IH. Systemic therapy (corticosteroid or beta-blocker) was given during infancy in 58 of 59 (98%) and 24 of 59 (41%) received systemic therapy (beta-blockers) for late IH growth. LIMITATIONS: The retrospective nature and ascertainment by investigator recall are limitations of the study. CONCLUSION: Late IH growth can occur in children after 3 years of age. Risk factors include head and neck location, segmental morphology, and involvement of deep dermal/subcutaneous tissues.",Late growth of infantile hemangiomas in children >3 years of age: A retrospective study.
"There is considerable evidence that emotion dysregulation and self-control impairments lead to escalated aggression in populations with psychiatric disorders. However, convergent quantitative evidence on the neural network explaining how aggression arises is still lacking. To address this gap, peak activations extracted from extant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were synthesized through coordinate-based meta-analyses. A systematic search in the PubMed database was conducted and 26 fMRI studies met the inclusion criteria. Three separate activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses were performed on (1) individual differences in trait aggression (TA) studies, (2) individual differences in TA studies examining executive functioning, and (3) elicited aggression (EA) studies across fMRI behavioral paradigms. Ensuing clusters from ALE meta-analyses were further treated as seeds for follow-up investigations on consensus connectivity networks (CCN) delineated from meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) to further characterize their physiological functions. Finally, we obtained a data-driven functional characterization of the ensuing clusters and their networks. This approach offers a boarder view of the ensuing clusters using a boarder network perspective. In TA, aberrant brain activations were found only in the right precuneus. Follow-up analyses revealed that the precuneus seed was within the frontal-parietal network (FPN) associated with action inhibition, visuospatial processing and higher-level cognition. With further restricting to only experiments examining executive functioning, convergent evidence was found in the right rolandic operculum (RO), midcingulate cortex (MCC), precentral gyrus (PrG) and precuneus. Follow-up analyses suggested that RO, MCC and PrG may belong to a common cognitive control network, while the MCC seems to be the hub of this network. In EA, we only revealed a convergent region in the left postcentral gyrus. Follow-up CCN analyses and functional characterizations suggested that this region may also belong to the same cognitive control network found in the TA sub-analysis. Our results suggested that escalated aggression arises from abnormal precuneus activities within the FPN, disrupting the recruitment of other large-scale networks such as adaptive cognitive control network. Consequently, failure to recruit such a network results in an inability to generate adaptive responses, increasing the likelihood of acting aggressively.",Neural networks of aggression: ALE meta-analyses on trait and elicited aggression.
"Deletions on chromosome 15q14 are a known chromosomal cause of cleft palate, typically co-occurring with intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and congenital heart defects. The identification of patients with loss-of-function variants in MEIS2, a gene within this deletion, suggests that these features are attributed to haploinsufficiency of MEIS2. To further delineate the phenotypic spectrum of the MEIS2-related syndrome, we collected 23 previously unreported patients with either a de novo sequence variant in MEIS2 (9 patients), or a 15q14 microdeletion affecting MEIS2 (14 patients). All but one de novo MEIS2 variant were identified by whole-exome sequencing. One variant was found by targeted sequencing of MEIS2 in a girl with a clinical suspicion of this syndrome. In addition to the triad of palatal defects, heart defects, and developmental delay, heterozygous loss of MEIS2 results in recurrent facial features, including thin and arched eyebrows, short alae nasi, and thin vermillion. Genotype-phenotype comparison between patients with 15q14 deletions and patients with sequence variants or intragenic deletions within MEIS2, showed a higher prevalence of moderate-to-severe intellectual disability in the former group, advocating for an independent locus for psychomotor development neighboring MEIS2.","Heterozygous loss-of-function variants of MEIS2 cause a triad of palatal defects, congenital heart defects, and intellectual disability."
"OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to identify the frequency with which tidal volumes were achieved in a target range in infants requiring positive pressure ventilation on emergency transport. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a prospective observational study of infants requiring continued positive pressure ventilation during emergency transport after resuscitation and stabilization. Blindly recorded data were analyzed for percentage of breaths that were below range, in range, and above desired range of 4-6 mL/kg. RESULT: Fourteen patients were monitored during transport from the delivery room to the neonatal intensive care unit, and 15 patients were monitored during inter-facility transport. During delivery room transport, 21 and 7% of patients were in target range greater than 50 and 90% of the time, respectively. During inter-hospital transport, 60 and 7% of patients were in target range greater than 50 and 90% of the time, respectively. CONCLUSION: Clinical assessment of appropriate ventilation is difficult and often inaccurate during emergency neonatal transport. Improved monitoring of respiratory function to guide clinical status during transport is necessary. More investigation and implementation are urgently needed.",Tidal volume monitoring during emergency neonatal transport.
"Patients with metastatic or unresectable (advanced) pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL) have poor prognoses and few treatment options. This multicenter, phase 2 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of high-specific-activity I-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (HSA I-131 MIBG) in patients with advanced PPGL. Methods: In this open-label, single-arm study, 81 PPGL patients were screened for enrollment, and 74 received a treatment-planning dose of HSA I-131 MIBG. 68 patients with advanced PPGL received at least one therapeutic dose (~18.5 GBq) of HSA I-131 MIBG intravenously. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in baseline antihypertensive medication use lasting at least 6 months. Secondary endpoints included objective tumor response as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0; biochemical tumor marker response; overall survival (OS); and safety. Results: Of the 68 patients who received at least one therapeutic dose of HSA I-131 MIBG, 17 (25%; 95% CI, 16-37%) had a durable reduction in baseline antihypertensive medication use. Among 64 patients with evaluable disease, 59 (92%) had a partial response or stable disease as the best objective response within 12 months. Decreases in elevated (>/=1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at baseline) serum CgA levels were observed with confirmed complete and partial responses 12 months after treatment in 19 of 28 patients (68%). The median OS duration was 36.7 months (95% CI, 29.9-49.1 months). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea, myelosuppression, and fatigue. No patients had drug-related acute hypertensive events during or after the administration of HSA I-131 MIBG. Conclusion: HSA I-131 MIBG offers multiple benefits, including sustained blood pressure control and tumor response in PPGL patients.",Efficacy and Safety of High-Specific-Activity I-131 MIBG Therapy in Patients with Advanced Pheochromocytoma or Paraganglioma.
"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) plays well characterized roles in brain and spinal cord development, but its functions in the hypothalamus have been more difficult to elucidate owing to the complex neuroanatomy of this brain area. Here, we use fate mapping and conditional deletion models in mice to define requirements for dynamic Shh activity at distinct developmental stages in the tuberal hypothalamus, a brain region with important homeostatic functions. At early time points, Shh signaling regulates dorsoventral patterning, neurogenesis and the size of the ventral midline. Fate-mapping experiments demonstrate that Shh-expressing and -responsive progenitors contribute to distinct neuronal subtypes, accounting for some of the cellular heterogeneity in tuberal hypothalamic nuclei. Conditional deletion of the hedgehog transducer smoothened (Smo), after dorsoventral patterning has been established, reveals that Shh signaling is necessary to maintain proliferation and progenitor identity during peak periods of hypothalamic neurogenesis. We also find that mosaic disruption of Smo causes a non-cell autonomous gain in Shh signaling activity in neighboring wild-type cells, suggesting a mechanism for the pathogenesis of hypothalamic hamartomas, benign tumors that form during hypothalamic development.",Distinct temporal requirements for Sonic hedgehog signaling in development of the tuberal hypothalamus.
"Surgical interventions on blood vessels bear a risk for intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis as a consequence of injury. A specific feature of intimal hyperplasia is the loss of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation gene expression. We hypothesized that immediate responses following injury induce vascular remodeling. To differentiate injury due to trauma, reperfusion and pressure changes we analyzed vascular responses to carotid artery bypass grafting in mice compared to transient ligation. As a control, the carotid artery was surgically laid open only. In both, bypass or ligation models, the inflammatory responses were transient, peaking after 6h, whereas the loss of VSMC differentiation gene expression persisted. Extended time kinetics showed that transient carotid artery ligation was sufficient to induce a persistent VSMC phenotype change throughout 28 days. Transient arterial ligation in ApoE knockout mice resulted in atherosclerosis in the transiently ligated vascular segment but not on the not-ligated contralateral side. The VSMC phenotype change could not be prevented by anti-TNF antibodies, Sorafenib, Cytosporone B or N-acetylcysteine treatment. Surgical interventions involving hypoxia/reperfusion are sufficient to induce VSMC phenotype changes and vascular remodeling. In situations of a perturbed lipid metabolism this bears the risk to precipitate atherosclerosis.",Hypoxia/reperfusion predisposes to atherosclerosis.
"Pallister-Killian syndrome (PKS) is a tissue limited mosaic disorder, characterized by variable degrees of neurodevelopmental delay and intellectual disability, typical craniofacial findings, skin pigmentation anomalies and multiple congenital malformations. The wide phenotypic spectrum of PKS in conjunction with the mosaic distribution of the i(12p) makes PKS an underdiagnosed disorder. Recognition of prenatal findings that should raise a suspicion of PKS is complicated by the fragmentation of data currently available in the literature and challenges in diagnosing a mosaic diagnosis on prenatal testing. Ultrasound anomalies, especially congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital heart defects, and rhizomelic limb shortening, have been related to PKS, but they are singularly not specific and are not present in all affected fetuses. We have combined prenatal data from 86 previously published reports and from our cohort of 114 PKS probands (retrospectively reviewed). Summarizing this data we have defined a prenatal growth profile and identified markers of perinatal outcome which collectively provide guidelines for early recognition of the distinctive prenatal profile and consideration of a diagnosis of PKS as well as for management and genetic counseling.","Prenatal profile of Pallister-Killian syndrome: Retrospective analysis of 114 pregnancies, literature review and approach to prenatal diagnosis."
"Structural and functional elements of biological systems are highly conserved across vertebrates. Many neurological and psychiatric conditions affect both humans and animals. A cross-species approach to the study of brain and behaviour can advance our understanding of human disorders via the identification of unrecognized natural models of spontaneous disorders, thus revealing novel factors that increase vulnerability or resilience, and via the assessment of potential therapies. Moreover, diagnostic and therapeutic advances in human neurology and psychiatry can often be adapted for veterinary patients. However, clinical and research collaborations between physicians and veterinarians remain limited, leaving this wealth of comparative information largely untapped. Here, we review pain, cognitive decline syndromes, epilepsy, anxiety and compulsions, autoimmune and infectious encephalitides and mismatch disorders across a range of animal species, looking for novel insights with translational potential. This comparative perspective can help generate novel hypotheses, expand and improve clinical trials and identify natural animal models of disease resistance and vulnerability.",A cross-species approach to disorders affecting brain and behaviour.
"BACKGROUND: Store-and-forward (SAF) teledermatology (TD) has the potential to increase access to timely, high-quality care for underserved populations. However, the cost-effectiveness of TD for underserved populations is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the potential cost savings associated with an SAF TD program implemented for an underserved population in the city health clinics of urban Philadelphia. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of SAF TD consultations for 700 outpatients managed in 12 Philadelphia primary care clinics. Primary care providers were asked to specify a treatment plan, as well as the type of care for the patient, in the absence of the TD service. Analysis compared the cost of each patient case with use of the TD consult model versus with conventional care. RESULTS: In all, 27% of in-person dermatology clinic visits (189 of 700) and 3.29% of emergency room visits (23 of 700) were avoided by using TD. Compared with conventional care, TD had a mean expected cost savings of $10.00 to $52.65 per TD consult. In sensitivity analyses, these estimated savings remained positive across a range of parameters. LIMITATIONS: The cost analysis relies on several assumptions regarding the cost of care, and indirect costs were not included. CONCLUSION: TD can be a cost-saving model while increasing access to dermatologic care.",Cost analysis of a store-and-forward teledermatology consult system in Philadelphia.

"Background: We hypothesize that being an editorial board member (EBM) in a high impact factor specialty medical journal increases the chances of publishing in the same journal. Materials and Methods: The publication trends of the first five EBMs in the five highest impact factor Anesthesiology and Gastroenterology journals were analyzed. Preceding 5 years' publications appearing on PubMed were grouped into as follows: number of publications in the journal in which the EBM serves (N1), number of publications by the same author in the other four highest impact factor (IF) journals (N2) and number of publications in all the other journals (N3). We evaluated the probability of the observed distribution of publications in the five highest IF journals happening by chance alone, assuming that all the EBMs had the same opportunity of publishing in any of these journals. The probability of publishing in their own journal was assumed to be one fifth. Results: The EBMs published their manuscripts in their own journal at a very high frequency. Encompassing all ten journals, the calculated P value for such a distribution was <0.001. In two journals, Anesthesia and Analgesia and Anaesthesia, the EBMs' publications in their journal were more than twice the cumulative total in the remaining four journals. In three of the five gastroenterology journals analyzed, combined publications of the five EBMs were greater in their own journal than the remaining four journals combined.

"Clinical trials for orphan diseases are critical for developing effective therapies. One such condition, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; MIM#135100), is characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) that leads to severe disability. Individuals with FOP are extremely sensitive to even minor traumatic events. There has been substantial recent interest in clinical trials for novel and urgently-needed treatments for FOP. The International Clinical Council on FOP (ICC) was established in 2016 to provide consolidated and coordinated advice on the best practices for clinical care and clinical research for individuals who suffer from FOP. The Clinical Trials Committee of the ICC developed a focused list of key considerations that encompass the specific and unique needs of the FOP community - considerations that are endorsed by the entire ICC. These considerations complement established protocols for developing and executing robust clinical trials by providing a foundation for helping to ensure the safety of subjects with FOP in clinical research trials.",Special considerations for clinical trials in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP).
"Older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) receive care that is fragmented and burdensome, lacks evidence, and most importantly is not focused on what matters most to them. An implementation feasibility study of Patient Priorities Care (PPC), a new approach to care that is based on health outcome goals and healthcare preferences, was conducted. This study took place at 1 primary care and 1 cardiology practice in Connecticut and involved 9 primary care providers (PCPs), 5 cardiologists, and 119 older adults with MCCs. PPC was implemented using methods based on a practice change framework and continuous plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Core elements included leadership support, clinical champions, priorities facilitators, training, electronic health record (EHR) support, workflow development and continuous modification, and collaborative learning. PPC processes for clinic workflow and decision-making were developed, and clinicians were trained. After 10 months, 119 older adults enrolled and had priorities identified; 92 (77%) returned to their PCP after priorities identification. In 56 (46%) of these visits, clinicians documented patient priorities discussions. Workflow challenges identified and solved included patient enrollment lags, EHR documentation of priorities discussions, and interprofessional communication. Time for clinicians to provide PPC remains a challenge, as does decision-making, including clinicians' perceptions that they are already doing so; clinicians' concerns about guidelines, metrics, and unrealistic priorities; and differences between PCPs and patients and between PCPs and cardiologists about treatment decisions. PDSA cycles and continuing collaborative learning with national experts and peers are taking place to address workflow and clinical decision-making challenges. Translating disease-based to priorities-aligned decision-making appears challenging but feasible to implement in a clinical setting.",Feasibility of Implementing Patient Priorities Care for Older Adults with Multiple Chronic Conditions.
"Waivers of informed consent for research participation are permitted in the United States under the Common Rule, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations, and the US Food and Drug Administration's Exception from Informed Consent rule for emergency research. We assess the novel question regarding what legal right researchers have to carry out research procedures on or about another person, be it experimental medical intervention, psychological or social manipulation, or invasion of privacy, without the permission of their subjects. Our analysis frames waivers of consent as a species of presumed consent, and we address the underlying empirical question of whether it is reasonable to believe that subjects from whom no consent is sought would in fact agree, if asked. A scoping review of what is known about participation and refusal rates in United States-based research suggests that a large minority, on average, do not agree to take part in research. Refusal rates vary widely. This suggests that, while researchers may assert the social utility of their studies are high enough to justify waivers, there is reason to suspect that many who would be enrolled under a waiver of consent would not want to be enrolled. We conclude that waivers should be rare and that institutional review boards and researchers must explicitly address study acceptability in the community at large and the target population of their proposed research.",What gives them the right?

"Nanostructures have potential for use in biomedical applications such as sensing, imaging, therapeutics, and drug delivery. Among nanomaterials, gold nanostructures are of considerable interest for biomedical research, owing to their bio-inertness, controllable surface chemistry, X-ray opacity, and optical properties. Gold nanocages are particularly attractive for imaging and therapeutic applications, because they strongly absorb light in the near infra-red region which has high light transmission in tissue. However, the X-ray attenuation of nanocages is relatively low due to their hollow structure. In this study, for the first time, we sought to combine the attractive optical properties of nanoshells with the high payloads of solid nanoparticles and investigated their biomedical applications. Here, we report the engineering of Wulff in a cage nanoparticles via converting gold Wulff-shaped seeds into gold-silver core-shell structures and then performing a galvanic replacement reaction. The structure of these nanoparticles was determined using transition electron microscopy. This morphological transformation of gold nanoparticles shaped as truncated octahedrons into a complex Wulff in a cage nanoparticles during the reaction resulted in extensive changes in their optical properties that made these unique structures a potential contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging. We found that the Wulff in a cage nanoparticles had no adverse effects on the viabilities of J774A.1, Renca, and HepG2 cells at any of the concentrations tested. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed robust signals in both photoacoustic imaging and computed tomography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Wulff in a cage nanoparticles serving as a platform for multiple imaging modalities. This unique multifunctional nanostructure, which integrates the competencies of both core and shell structures, allows their use as contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging, computed tomography and as a potential agent for photothermal therapy.",Wulff in a cage gold nanoparticles as contrast agents for computed tomography and photoacoustic imaging.
"GAW20 provided participants with an opportunity to comprehensively examine genetic and epigenetic variation among related individuals in the context of drug treatment response. GAW20 used data from 188 families (N = 1105) participating in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00083369), which included CD4+ T-cell DNA methylation at 463,995 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites measured before and after a 3-week treatment with fenofibrate, single-nucleotide variation at 906,600 loci, metabolic syndrome components ascertained before and after the drug intervention, and relevant covariates. All GOLDN participants were of European descent, with an average age of 48 years. In addition, approximately half were women and approximately 40% met the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome. Unique advantages of the GAW20data set included longitudinal (3 weeks apart) measurements of DNA methylation, the opportunity to explore the contributions of both genotype and DNA methylation to the interindividual variability in drug treatment response, and the familial relationships between study participants. The principal disadvantage of GAW20/GOLDN data was the spurious correlation between batch effects and fenofibrate effects on methylation, which arose because the pre- and posttreatment methylation data were generated and normalized separately, and any attempts to remove time-dependent technical artifacts would also remove biologically meaningful changes brought on by fenofibrate. Despite this limitation, the GAW20 data set offered informative, multilayered omics data collected in a large population-based study of common disease traits, which resulted in creative approaches to integration and analysis of inherited human variation.",Data for GAW20: genome-wide DNA sequence variation and epigenome-wide DNA methylation before and after fenofibrate treatment in a family study of metabolic phenotypes.

To fill this gap in scientific knowledge, we recently optimized the circle-sequencing assay to detect transcription errors throughout the transcriptome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. This protocol will provide researchers with a powerful new tool to map the landscape of transcription errors in eukaryotic cells so that the mechanisms that control the fidelity of transcription can be elucidated in unprecedented detail.",Genome-wide Surveillance of Transcription Errors in Eukaryotic Organisms.

"Sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare subtype of RMS with unique prominent stromal hyalinization and a pseudovascular architecture. It overlaps morphologically with spindle cell RMS and poses both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges because of its rarity and aggressive clinical course. In this article, we report a case of sclerosing RMS arising from a prior craniotomy site, which demonstrated both sclerosing and spindle cell components. A literature review of RMS with sclerosing morphology identified 122 cases. Our review documents the following: sclerosing RMS occurs in both childhood and adult populations, has a predilection for the head and neck areas, and has a worse prognosis in adults. Sclerosing RMS harbors a high frequency of MYOD1 mutations, conferring a poor clinical outcome. Sclerosing RMS and spindle RMS likely represent a morphologic spectrum of one entity.",Combined Sclerosing and Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma in Previous Craniotomy Site: A Case Report and a Review of the Literature.
"BACKGROUND:: Although most children report symptom resolution within a month of a concussion, some patients experience persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS) that continues for more than 1 month. Identifying patients at risk for PPCS soon after an injury can provide useful clinical information. PURPOSE:: To determine if the Predicting Persistent Post-concussive Problems in Pediatrics (5P) clinical risk score, an emergency department (ED)-derived and validated tool, is associated with developing PPCS when obtained in a primary care sports concussion setting. STUDY DESIGN:: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS:: We conducted a study of patients seen at a pediatric sports medicine concussion clinic between May 1, 2013, and October 1, 2017, who were <19 years of age and evaluated within 10 days of a concussion. The main outcome was PPCS, defined as symptoms lasting >28 days. Nine variables were used to calculate the 5P clinical risk score, and we assessed the association between the 5P clinical risk score and PPCS occurrence. The secondary outcome was total symptom duration. RESULTS:: We examined data from 230 children (mean age, 14.8 +/- 2.5 years; 50% female; mean time from injury to clinical assessment, 5.6 +/- 2.7 days). In univariable analyses, a greater proportion of those who developed PPCS reported feeling slowed down (72% vs 44%, respectively; P < .001), headache (94% vs 72%, respectively; P < .001), sensitivity to noise (71% vs 43%, respectively; P < .001), and fatigue (82% vs 51%, respectively; P < .001) and committed >/=4 errors in tandem stance (33% vs 7%, respectively; P < .001) than those who did not. Higher 5P clinical risk scores were associated with increased odds of developing PPCS (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.62 [95% CI, 1.30-2.02]) and longer symptom resolution times (beta = 8.40 [95% CI, 3.25-13.50]). Among the individual participants who received a high 5P clinical risk score (9-12), the majority (82%) went on to experience PPCS. The area under the curve for the 5P clinical risk score was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.66-0.84). After adjusting for the effect of covariates, fatigue (adjusted OR, 2.93) and >/=4 errors in tandem stance (adjusted OR, 7.40) were independently associated with PPCS. CONCLUSION:: Our findings extend the potential use for an ED-derived clinical risk score for predicting the PPCS risk into the sports concussion clinic setting. While not all 9 predictor variables of the 5P clinical risk score were independently associated with the PPCS risk in univariable or multivariable analyses, the combination of factors used to calculate the 5P clinical risk score was significantly associated with the odds of developing PPCS. Thus, obtaining clinically pragmatic risk scores soon after a concussion may be useful for early treatments or interventions to mitigate the PPCS risk.",Identifying Persistent Postconcussion Symptom Risk in a Pediatric Sports Medicine Clinic.

"OBJECTIVE: The multifaceted nature of the transition of care from the triage unit to labor and delivery has historically led to confusion, delays, and errors in care. This study evaluated the effect of standardization of roles and communication on improving this transition. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team was assembled to define and standardize roles of team members. A huddle safety board was created as a visual aid to promote closed-loop communication during an admission bedside huddle. The primary metrics collected were duration of time from the admission decision in the triage unit to when the admission huddle was completed on labor and delivery, duration of time from the admission decision in the triage unit to initiation of the plan of care and documented completion of the admission huddle. RESULTS: There was a 66-minute reduction in time from the admission decision to the huddle completion between the preintervention and postintervention periods. There was a 93-minute reduction in the time from the admission decision to when the plan of care was initiated between the preintervention and post-intervention periods. The weekly huddle compliance rate improved from 48% to 84% by the postintervention period. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of standardized roles and processes facilitating closed-loop communication decreases delays in communication and initiation of care in pregnant women transferred from the triage unit to labor and delivery.",Safe Passage: Improving the Transition of Care Between Triage and Labor and Delivery.
"BACKGROUND: Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) after surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis is generally associated with worse outcomes. Transcatheter AVR (TAVR) can achieve a larger valve orifice and the effects of PPM after TAVR are less well studied. OBJECTIVES: The authors utilized the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology TVT (Transcatheter Valve Therapy) registry to examine the frequency, predictors, and association with outcomes of PPM after TAVR in 62,125 patients enrolled between 2014 and 2017. METHODS: On the basis of the discharge echocardiographic effective valve area indexed to body surface area, PPM was classified as severe (<0.65 cm(2)/m(2)), moderate (0.65 to 0.85 cm(2)/m(2)), or none (>0.85 cm(2)/m(2)). Multivariable regression models were utilized to examine predictors of severe PPM as well as adjusted outcomes, including mortality, heart failure (HF) rehospitalization, stroke, and quality of life, at 1 year in 37,470 Medicare patients with claims linkage. RESULTS: Severe and moderate PPM were present following TAVR in 12% and 25% of patients, respectively. Predictors of severe PPM included small (</=23-mm diameter) valve prosthesis, valve-in-valve procedure, larger body surface area, female sex, younger age, non-white/Hispanic race, lower ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, and severe mitral or tricuspid regurgitation. At 1 year, mortality was 17.2%, 15.6%, and 15.9% in severe, moderate, and no PPM patients, respectively (p = 0.02). HF rehospitalization had occurred in 14.7%, 12.8%, and 11.9% of patients with severe, moderate, and no PPM, respectively (p < 0.0001). There was no association of severe PPM with stroke or quality-of-life score at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Severe PPM after TAVR was present in 12% of patients and was associated with higher mortality and HF rehospitalization at 1 year. Further investigation is warranted into the prevention of severe PPM in patients undergoing TAVR.",Prosthesis-Patient Mismatch in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: From the STS/ACC TVT Registry.
"Physicians have observed that surgical wounds in the elderly heal with thinner scars than wounds in young patients. Understanding this phenomenon may reveal strategies for promoting scarless wound repair. We show that full-thickness skin wounds in aged but not young mice fully regenerate. Exposure of aged animals to blood from young mice by parabiosis counteracts this regenerative capacity. The secreted factor, stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1), is expressed at higher levels in wounded skin of young mice. Genetic deletion of SDF1 in young skin enhanced tissue regeneration. In aged mice, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation are recruited to the SDF1 promoter at higher levels, and pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 restores SDF1 induction and prevents tissue regeneration. Similar age-dependent EZH2-mediated SDF1 suppression occurs in human skin. Our findings counter the current dogma that tissue function invariably declines with age and suggest new therapeutic strategies in regenerative medicine.",Aging Suppresses Skin-Derived Circulating SDF1 to Promote Full-Thickness Tissue Regeneration.
"OBJECTIVE: Given the chronic, episodic nature of panic disorder, it is important to examine long-term outcomes of patients who respond well to various psychotherapies. METHOD: Out of 116 patients with DSM-IV panic disorder who evidenced a >/= 40% reduction in panic and avoidance symptoms on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) after 12-14 weeks of panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or applied relaxation training as part of a 2-site randomized controlled trial conducted between January 2007 and July 2012, 91 patients provided at least 1 PDSS datapoint during follow-up. Patients were assessed at each of the 12 following months using the PDSS, the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and twice during the follow-up period with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule. RESULTS: Patients with panic disorder who responded to 1 of 3 treatments maintained their gains on the PDSS, SDS, and HDRS with no differences by condition in rates of change over the follow-up period (all P values >/= .20). Similarly, 57% of improved patients did not have a panic disorder diagnosis by the end of 1 year, regardless of the treatment received. No differences in rates of panic disorder diagnosis were found across treatment conditions at either 6 months or 12 months (all P values >/= .78). Results should be interpreted in light of the fact that patients giving data at follow-up experienced lower symptom levels at treatment termination than those not providing data. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in any of the 3 treatments examined in this trial was largely maintained for a year following the end of therapy. Future treatment development could focus on factors to increase the level of response in the active phase of therapy.

"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases that causes problems related to brain function. To some extent it is understood on a molecular level how AD arises, however there are a lack of biomarkers that can be used for early diagnosis. Two popular methods to identify AD-related biomarkers use genetics and neuroimaging. Genes and neuroimaging phenotypes have provided some insights as to the potential for AD biomarkers. While the field of imaging-genomics has identified genetic features associated with structural and functional neuroimaging phenotypes, it remains unclear how variants that affect splicing could be important for understanding the genetic etiology of AD. METHODS: In this study, rare variants (minor allele frequency < 0.01) in splicing regulatory element (SRE) loci from whole genome sequencing (WGS) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, were used to identify genes that are associated with global brain cortical glucose metabolism in AD measured by FDG PET-scans. Gene-based associated analyses of rare variants were performed using the program BioBin and the optimal Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT-O). RESULTS: The gene, EXOC3L4, was identified as significantly associated with global cortical glucose metabolism (FDR (false discovery rate) corrected p < 0.05) using SRE coding variants only. Three loci that may affect splicing within EXOC3L4 contribute to the association. CONCLUSION: Based on sequence homology, EXOC3L4 is likely a part of the exocyst complex. Our results suggest the possibility that variants which affect proper splicing of EXOC3L4 via SREs may impact vesicle transport, giving rise to AD related phenotypes. Overall, by utilizing WGS and functional neuroimaging we have identified a gene significantly associated with an AD related endophenotype, potentially through a mechanism that involves splicing.",Rare variants in the splicing regulatory elements of EXOC3L4 are associated with brain glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.

"A fundamental challenge in understanding cardiac biology and disease is that the remarkable heterogeneity in cell type composition and functional states have not been well characterized at single-cell resolution in maturing and diseased mammalian hearts. Massively parallel single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool to address these questions by interrogating the transcriptome of tens of thousands of nuclei isolated from fresh or frozen tissues. snRNA-seq overcomes the technical challenge of isolating intact single cells from complex tissues, including the maturing mammalian hearts; reduces biased recovery of easily dissociated cell types; and minimizes aberrant gene expression during the whole-cell dissociation. Here we applied sNucDrop-seq, a droplet microfluidics-based massively parallel snRNA-seq method, to investigate the transcriptional landscape of postnatal maturing mouse hearts in both healthy and disease states. By profiling the transcriptome of nearly 20,000 nuclei, we identified major and rare cardiac cell types and revealed significant heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in postnatal developing hearts. When applied to a mouse model of pediatric mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, we uncovered profound cell type-specific modifications of the cardiac transcriptional landscape at single-nucleus resolution, including changes of subtype composition, maturation states, and functional remodeling of each cell type. Furthermore, we employed sNucDrop-seq to decipher the cardiac cell type-specific gene regulatory network (GRN) of GDF15, a heart-derived hormone and clinically important diagnostic biomarker of heart disease. Together, our results present a rich resource for studying cardiac biology and provide new insights into heart disease using an approach broadly applicable to many fields of biomedicine.",Single-nucleus transcriptomic survey of cell diversity and functional maturation in postnatal mammalian hearts.
"BACKGROUND: A current challenge in osteoporosis is identifying patients at risk of bone fracture. PURPOSE: To identify the machine learning classifiers that predict best osteoporotic bone fractures and, from the data, to highlight the imaging features and the anatomical regions that contribute most to prediction performance. STUDY TYPE: Prospective (cross-sectional) case-control study. POPULATION: Thirty-two women with prior fragility bone fractures, of mean age = 61.6 and body mass index (BMI) = 22.7 kg/m(2) , and 60 women without fractures, of mean age = 62.3 and BMI = 21.4 kg/m(2) . Field Strength/ Sequence: 3D FLASH at 3T. ASSESSMENT: Quantitative MRI outcomes by software algorithms. Mechanical and topological microstructural parameters of the trabecular bone were calculated for five femoral regions, and added to the vector of features together with bone mineral density measurement, fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) score, and personal characteristics such as age, weight, and height. We fitted 15 classifiers using 200 randomized cross-validation datasets. Statistical Tests: Data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. Model Performance: sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, F1-test, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Two-sided t-test, with P < 0.05 for statistical significance. RESULTS: The top three performing classifiers are RUS-boosted trees (in particular, performing best with head data, F1 = 0.64 +/- 0.03), the logistic regression and the linear discriminant (both best with trochanteric datasets, F1 = 0.65 +/- 0.03 and F1 = 0.67 +/- 0.03, respectively). A permutation of these classifiers comprised the best three performers for four out of five anatomical datasets. After averaging across all the anatomical datasets, the score for the best performer, the boosted trees, was F1 = 0.63 +/- 0.03 for All-features dataset, F1 = 0.52 +/- 0.05 for the no-MRI dataset, and F1 = 0.48 +/- 0.06 for the no-FRAX dataset. Data Conclusion: Of many classifiers, the RUS-boosted trees, the logistic regression, and the linear discriminant are best for predicting osteoporotic fracture. Both MRI and FRAX independently add value in identifying osteoporotic fractures. The femoral head, greater trochanter, and inter-trochanter anatomical regions within the proximal femur yielded better F1-scores for the best three classifiers.

"BACKGROUND: The authors assess the impact of rhinoplasty on public perception of a patient's appearance and personality. METHODS: A survey was created using standardized before-and-after photographs of 10 Caucasian women who had undergone primary rhinoplasty. Photographs of two additional women who had not undergone facial surgery were randomly included as controls, for a total of 12 survey items. Preoperative and postoperative photographs were placed side by side. The survey was administered by means of crowd-sourcing. Respondents were asked to evaluate which photograph better represented 11 traits of appearance or personality, according to a seven-point Likert scale. A score of 1 meant the preoperative photograph was much better, 7 meant the postoperative photograph was much better, and 4 meant no difference. T tests and analyses of variance were used to evaluate rating changes for each trait and differences between demographic groups. RESULTS: There were 264 responses received. Averaged scores across the 10 survey patients produced a value for each appearance or personality trait. In 10 of 11 categories (i.e., symmetry, youthfulness, facial harmony, likeability, trustworthiness, confidence, femininity, attractiveness, approachability, and intelligence), the postoperative photograph was significantly favorable compared with the preoperative photograph (p < 0.00001). The preoperative photograph was rated higher only in aggressiveness (p < 0.001). The same scores were calculated for the controls; no significant difference in any category was seen except confidence, where the right image was viewed as more confident (mean, 4.19; p < 0.005).

"INTRODUCTION: The relationship between spinal structure and respiratory function has been coined as thoracic insufficiency syndrome and is defined as the inability of the thorax to support normal respiratory function or lung growth. Little is known about what supports this relationship in untreated nonambulatory myelomeningocele patients. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study of nonambulatory myelodysplasia patients was performed. Anatomic, radiographic, and functional parameters were evaluated to validate the respiratory-spinal structure relationship. Thirty-one patients diagnosed with nonambulatory myelomeningocele fulfilled the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The imaging study confirmed the spinal deformity. Lung functions measured in this patient population describe reduced lung volumes by CT lung volume reconstruction, reduced vital capacity by spirometry, and reduced total lung capacity by the nitrogen washout method. Together, these findings suggest moderate restrictive respiratory disease. The blood count study did not show evidence of anemia or other blood disturbances. Echocardiogram analysis did not show pulmonary hypertension in any patient. CONCLUSION: The data validate the relationship between spinal structure and lung function. However, there is no simple structural feature that could help to diagnose thoracic insufficiency syndrome. Thus, the diagnosis continues to be based on a combination of clinical findings and radiological and respiratory function evaluations.

Data analyses suggested that intimate partner violence (IPV) screening for ethnic minority women in health care settings can be improved by informing patients about the role of health care providers in addressing IPV, establishing rapport before IPV screening, assuring confidentiality is maintained, respecting Korean immigrant women's unique perspectives and response toward IPV, providing translation services, and collaborating with ethnic minority women's community organizations.",The Perspectives of Volunteer Counselors of Korean Immigrant Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence.
"While the association between sleep-related breathing disorders such as snoring and hypertension has been well established, it still remains unclear whether the association differs by age and gender. Therefore, in this 14-year follow-up study, we examined the independent association between self-reported snoring and the incidence of hypertension by gender and age groups in a large cohort of Korean adults. A total of 4,954 adults, aged 40-69 years, free of hypertension at baseline were enrolled. Participants were divided into three groups based on a self-reported snoring frequency: never; occasional (snoring <4 nights per week); and habitual snorer (snoring >/=4 nights). At baseline and biennial follow-up visits, blood pressure was measured by trained examiners. Incident hypertension was defined as the first occurrence at any follow-up examination where the participants had blood pressure >/=140/90 mmHg or were being treated with antihypertensive medication. After adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors, only in men aged </=45 years was habitual snoring significantly associated with a 1.5 times higher risk for incident hypertension than never snoring. In this age group, habitual snoring was significantly associated with increased risk for the development of hypertension, regardless of the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness. In women, snoring was not significantly associated with hypertension incidence in any age group. The present study suggests that young male snorers may be at high risk for the future development of hypertension, which has important clinical implications for early detection and treatment of snoring to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease.",Increased risk for new-onset hypertension in midlife male snorers: The 14-year follow-up study.
"Directing neurons to form predetermined circuits with the intention of treating neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases is a fundamental goal and current challenge in neuroengineering. Until recently, only neuronal aggregates were studied and characterized in culture, which can limit information gathered to populations of cells. In this study, we use a substrate constructed of arrays of strain-induced self-rolled-up membrane 3D architectures. This results in changes in the neuronal architecture and altered growth dynamics of neurites. Hippocampal neurons from postnatal rats were cultured at low confluency ( approximately 250 cells mm(-2)) on an array of transparent rolled-up microtubes (mu-tubes; 4-5 mum diameter) of varying topographical arrangements. Neurite growth on the mu-tubes was characterized and compared to controls in order to establish a baseline for alignment imposed by the topography. Compared to control substrates, neurites are significantly more aligned toward the 0 degrees reference on the mu-tube array. Pitch (20-60 and 100 mum) and mu-tube length (30-80 mum) of array elements were also varied to investigate their impact on neurite alignment. We found that alignment was improved by the gradient pitch arrangement and with longer mu-tubes. Application of this technology will enhance the ability to construct intentional neural circuits through array design and manipulation of individual neurons and can be adapted to address challenges in neural repair, reinnervation, and neuroregeneration.",Aligning Synthetic Hippocampal Neural Circuits via Self-Rolled-Up Silicon Nitride Microtube Arrays.

"AIM: Examine the state of the science for pain management in children living in low-middle income countries (LMIC). BACKGROUND: Significant challenges exist in pain management for children living in LMIC. METHODS: An integrative review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines for quality of reporting. Literature searches were completed using Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL databases for publications between January 2006 and August 2016 using MeSH and primary search terms pain and LMIC. Full text publications were evaluated using GRADE criterion and methodology specific evaluation tools. RESULTS: Of 1510 publications identified, 31 met the criteria for inclusion. Data were categorized into three broad themes: (1) magnitude of the pain problem with subthemes describing the burden of and resources for paediatric pain management; (2) perceptions, experience, and practices for managing pain in children residing in LMIC with subthemes addressing health care providers, parent/caregiver and children, respectively; and (3) pain management practices with pain assessment and treatment strategies as subthemes. CONCLUSION: Current data on paediatric pain management in LMIC are limited with respect to describing the burden of pain, children's pain perceptions and experiences, and pain management practices.

"Context: Diazoxide, the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug to treat hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, has been associated with several adverse events, which has raised concerns about the safety of this drug. Existing reports are limited to small studies and case reports. Objective: To determine prevalence of and clinical factors associated with adverse events in infants and children treated with diazoxide. Design: Retrospective cohort study of children with hyperinsulinism (HI) treated with diazoxide between 2003 and 2014. Setting: The Congenital Hyperinsulinism Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Patients: Children and infants with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of HI. Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of pulmonary hypertension (PH), edema, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperuricemia was determined. Tests of association and logistic regression were used to identify potential risk factors. Results: A total of 295 patients (129 female) met inclusion criteria. The median age at diazoxide initiation was 29 days (interquartile range, 10 to 142 days; n = 226 available start dates); 2.4% of patients were diagnosed with PH after diazoxide initiation. Children with PH (P = 0.003) or edema (P = 0.002) were born at earlier gestational age and more frequently had potential PH risk factors, including respiratory failure and structural heart disease (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.005). Other adverse events included neutropenia (15.6%), thrombocytopenia (4.7%), and hyperuricemia (5.0%). Conclusion: In this large cohort, PH occurred in infants with underlying risk factors, but no identifiable risk profile emerged for other adverse events. The relatively high prevalence of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperuricemia suggests the value in proactively screening for these side effects in children treated with diazoxide.",Prevalence of Adverse Events in Children With Congenital Hyperinsulinism Treated With Diazoxide.
"Objectives: Extremely premature infants are at high risk of developing invasive candidiasis; fluconazole prophylaxis is safe and effective for reducing invasive candidiasis in this population but further study is needed. We sought to better understand the effect of prophylactic fluconazole on a selection of fluconazole-resistant Candida species. Methods: We evaluated the susceptibility to fluconazole of Candida isolates from premature infants (<750 g birth weight) enrolled in a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of fluconazole prophylaxis. Candida species were isolated through surveillance cultures at baseline (study day 0-7), period 1 (study day 8-28) and period 2 (study day 29-49). Fluconazole MICs were determined for all Candida isolates. Results: Three hundred and sixty-one infants received fluconazole (n = 188) or placebo (n = 173). After the baseline period, Candida colonization was significantly lower in the fluconazole group compared with placebo during periods 1 (5% versus 27%; P < 0.001) and 2 (3% versus 27%; P < 0.001). After the baseline period, two infants (1%) were colonized with at least one fluconazole-resistant Candida in each group. Median fluconazole MIC was similar in both treatment groups at baseline and period 1. However, in period 2, median MIC was higher in the fluconazole group compared with placebo (1.00 versus 0.50 mg/L, P = 0.01). There was no emergence of resistance observed and no patients developed invasive candidiasis with a resistant Candida isolate. Conclusions: Fluconazole prophylaxis decreased Candida albicans and 'non-albicans' Candida colonization and was associated with a slightly higher fluconazole MIC for colonizing Candida isolates.",Effect of fluconazole prophylaxis on Candida fluconazole susceptibility in premature infants.
"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify time performing chest compressions (CCs) per year of individual providers in a pediatric ED and to project a rate of opportunity for CC based on median clinical hours per provider category. METHODS: This was an observational study of video-recorded resuscitations in a pediatric ED over 1 year. Events where CCs were performed for more than 2 minutes were included. Identification of providers and duration of CCs per provider were determined by video review. Time of CCs was totaled per provider over the study period. Data were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). Rate of opportunity for providing CC to a child was calculated by dividing the median clinical hours per year per provider type by the number of CC events per year. RESULTS: Twenty-three CC events totaling 340 minutes of CCs were analyzed. Chest compressions were performed by 6 (13%) of 45 attending physicians, 3 (25%) of 12 fellows, 32 (22%) of 143 nurses, and 19 (59%) of 32 technicians. The median amount of time performing CC was 182 seconds (IQR, 91-396 seconds); by provider category, median amount of time was as follows: attending physicians, 83 seconds (IQR, 64-103 seconds); fellows, 45 seconds (IQR, 6-83 seconds); nurses, 128 seconds (IQR, 93-271 seconds); and technicians, 534 seconds (IQR, 217-793 seconds). The projected hours needed for an opportunity to perform CCs was 730 hours (91 shifts) for attending physicians, 243 hours (30 shifts) for fellows, and 1460 hours (121 shifts) for nurses and technicians. CONCLUSIONS: Performing CCs on children in the ED is a rare event, with a median of 3 minutes per provider per year. Future studies should determine training methods to optimize readiness for these rare occurrences.",How Much Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Does a Pediatric Emergency Provider Perform in 1 Year?

"PURPOSE: Upper pole nephrectomy has been the traditional surgical management of children with poorly functioning upper pole moieties in duplex renal collecting systems having ureteral ectopia and ureterocele. However, ablative surgery confers a risk of functional loss to the remnant moiety due to vasospasm or vascular injury. It was hypothesized that ipsilateral ureteroureterostomy (IUU) is a safe and feasible approach for the management of these patients and that residual function in the obstructed upper pole does not affect surgical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with duplex systems who underwent IUU between 2010 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were sorted into two groups based on pre-operative imaging: those having <10% upper pole moiety function (UPMF) and those having >/= 10% UPMF. Outcomes assessed were postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification), need for secondary surgery, and radiological outcomes. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 53 children with ectopia or ureterocele affecting the upper pole in a duplex system, 21 with UPMF <10% (median function 0% and median age 1.49 years) and 32 with UPMF >/= 10% (median function 15% and median age 0.91 years). Median follow-up was 27.4 months and 27.6 months. In both the groups, prenatal hydronephrosis was the most common presentation (57% and 56%, respectively; p = 0.18) followed by urinary tract infection. Mann-Whitney U test comparing the two groups revealed no significant differences in any of the outcomes assessed. No patient required secondary surgery. CONCLUSION: Ipsilateral ureteroureterostomy is a safe, definitive surgical intervention that preserves the renal architecture in children with duplex collecting systems regardless of upper pole function.",Ipsilateral ureteroureterostomy: does function of the obstructed moiety matter?

"NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the largest and most complicated enzyme complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is the entry site into the respiratory chain for most of the reducing equivalents generated during metabolism, coupling electron transfer from NADH to quinone to proton translocation, which in turn drives ATP synthesis. Dysfunction of complex I is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, and it is proposed to be involved in aging. Complex I has one non-covalently bound FMN, eight to 10 iron-sulfur clusters, and protein-associated quinone molecules as electron transport components. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) has previously been the most informative technique, especially in membrane in situ analysis. The structure of complex 1 has now been resolved from a number of species, but the mechanisms by which electron transfer is coupled to transmembrane proton pumping remains unresolved. Ubiquinone-10, the terminal electron acceptor of complex I, is detectable by EPR in its one electron reduced, semiquinone (SQ) state. In the aerobic steady state of respiration the semi-ubiquinone anion has been observed and studied in detail. Two distinct protein-associated fast and slow relaxing, SQ signals have been resolved which were designated SQNf and SQNs. This review covers a five decade personal journey through the field leading to a focus on the unresolved questions of the role of the SQ radicals and their possible part in proton pumping.",Five decades of research on mitochondrial NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I).
"Rosacea has been reported less frequently among individuals with skin of color than in those with white skin, but rosacea is not a rare disease in this population. In fact, rosacea might be underreported and underdiagnosed in populations with skin of color because of the difficulty of discerning erythema and telangiectasia in dark skin. The susceptibility of persons with highly pigmented skin to dermatologic conditions like rosacea, whose triggers include sun exposure, is probably underestimated. Many people with skin of color who have rosacea might experience delayed diagnosis, leading to inappropriate or inadequate treatment; greater morbidity; and uncontrolled, progressive disease with disfiguring manifestations, including phymatous rosacea. In this article, we review the epidemiology of rosacea in skin of color and highlight variations in the clinical presentation of rosacea across the diverse spectrum of patient populations affected. We present strategies to aid in the timely diagnosis and effective treatment of rosacea in patients with skin of color, with an aim of promoting increased awareness of rosacea in these patients and reducing disparities in the management of their disease.","Global epidemiology and clinical spectrum of rosacea, highlighting skin of color: Review and clinical practice experience."
"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop an acceptable clinical decision support (CDS) system to facilitate evidence-based sexual health care for adolescents in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: In this multiphased iterative process, we engaged an expert group to synthesize evidence on a wide range of sexual health services (e.g., contraception, condoms, identification and treatment of previously diagnosed sexually transmitted infection). We created a computerized questionnaire and embedded our decision tree, utilizing patient-entered responses to create tailored, evidence-based recommendations, and embedded links to study-related resources such as the emergency contraception (EC) quick guide. We utilized mixed methodology to explore perspectives of adolescents aged 14 to 19 years and clinicians at two general and two pediatric EDs after they interacted with the system. Clinicians reported usefulness (Likert scale 1 = not at all, 4 = very); adolescents reported acceptability. We used the chi-square test to compare responses between subgroups. We collected adolescents' verbatim responses to open-ended questions; clinicians self-entered responses. Four authors independently generated themes from qualitative responses before compiling key findings and achieving consensus on final themes. RESULTS: Among 57 clinicians (23 physicians, 23 nurses, 11 nurse practitioners; 54% female; 65% aged < 40 years), the mean system usefulness rating was 3.4 +/- 0.7. Sex, age, clinician role, or ED type were not associated with rating the system ""somewhat/very"" useful. Clinicians identified barriers (e.g., time constraints) that could be overcome by implementation considerations (e.g., training) as well as benefits including improved care. For future assessments, providers preferred computer (65%) over face-to-face interview (26%). Among 57 adolescents (mean age = 16.2 years; 75% female; 56% sexually experienced), nearly all (95%) reported that it was ""very/somewhat easy"" to complete the computerized questionnaire and to understand the questions. Most adolescents understood the EC quick guide and correctly identified that ulipristal, compared to levonorgestrel, required a prescription and was more effective. For future assessments, adolescents preferred computer (69%) over face-to-face interviews (9%). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a sexual health CDS system that is easy to use and can facilitate evidence-based care to reduce health outcome gaps. Evaluation of system impact on service delivery and, ultimately, health outcomes is needed.",Development of a Novel Computerized Clinical Decision Support System to Improve Adolescent Sexual Health Care Provision.

"Pediatric patients are unique both in their diagnosis and clinical presentation before implantation of a ventricular assist device (VAD) and in their driveline site characteristics post-implant. There is limited evidence in scholarly literature that describes complications of pediatric VAD driveline sites or approaches by which to manage them. The Cardiac Center at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) follows a standard of care for HeartWare VAD (HVAD) dressing changes in the inpatient setting with the goal of transitioning patients to weekly dressing changes by the time they are discharged to home. As a patient with an HVAD nears discharge, members of an interprofessional team collaborate with insurance providers and home care agencies to procure the appropriate supplies needed at home. Individualized plans of care are necessary for patients who are unable to transition to weekly dressings; however, customized products (such as silicone foam border dressings and antimicrobial agents) may be challenging to supply as single items from home care agencies. Between March 2014 and June 2017, 15 patients underwent HVAD implantation, and eight (53%) were discharged home. Ten patients (67%) were able to transition to weekly dressing changes. Individualized plans of care for driveline site management were required for six (40%) patients with persistent drainage. Three patients (20%) experienced a driveline site infection. This article describes how a quality improvement (QI) initiative using rapid-cycle improvement methodology was executed to standardize HVAD dressing changes in our pediatric population.",Quality Over Quantity: Standardization of Pediatric HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device Dressing Changes.
"Body odors (BOs) can convey social information. In particular, their effects are maximal when their presence is paired with meaningful social contexts. Static faces have been widely used as social stimuli. However, they miss a key feature of our phenomenological experience, characterized by multisensory dynamic stimulations. Here, we investigate how BO sampled from individuals experiencing a transitory anxiety state, (a) induce a stress response and (b) bias the recognition of dynamic facial expressions, compared with BO of relaxed individuals. Participants ( n=46) categorized the emotion of a face, morphing from a neutral expression to either an angry or happy expression, during exposure to either BO condition. In addition, their cardiac activity was measured. Exposure to anxiety BO increased the accuracy of dynamic facial recognition and reduced cardiac parasympathetic activity. These results suggest that in social situations that simulate part of the multisensory and dynamic features of real-life social contexts, anxiety BOs will induce a stress response in recipients, modulating both arousal and cognitive-emotional skills but facilitating emotional facial processing.",Anxiety Body Odors as Context for Dynamic Faces: Categorization and Psychophysiological Biases.
"Objectives: Develop and test a new metric to assess meaningful variability in inpatient flow. Methods: Using the pediatric administrative dataset, Pediatric Health Information System, that quantifies the length of stay (LOS) in hours, all inpatient and observation encounters with 21 common diagnoses were included from the calendar year 2013 in 38 pediatric hospitals. Two mutually exclusive composite groups based on diagnosis and presence or absence of an ICU hospitalization termed Acute Care Composite (ACC) and ICU Composite (ICUC), respectively, were created. These composites consisted of an observed-to-expected (O/E) LOS as well as an excess LOS percentage (ie, the percent of day beyond expected). Seven-day all-cause risk-adjusted rehospitalizations was used as a balancing measure. The combination of the ACC, the ICUC, and the rehospitalization measures forms this new metric. Results: The diagnosis groups in the ACC and the ICUC included 113,768 and 38,400 hospitalizations, respectively. The ACC had a median O/E LOS of 1.0, a median excess LOS percentage of 23.9% and a rehospitalization rate of 1.7%. The ICUC had a median O/E LOS of 1.1, a median excess LOS percentage of 32.3%, and rehospitalization rate of 4.9%. There was no relationship of O/E LOS and rehospitalization for either ACC or ICUC. Conclusions: This metric shows variation among hospitals and could allow a pediatric hospital to assess the performance of inpatient flow.",Using Length of Stay to Understand Patient Flow for Pediatric Inpatients.
"Functionally important regions of sensory maps are overrepresented in the sensory pathways and cortex, but the underlying developmental mechanisms are not clear. In the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH), we recently showed that paw innervating Mrgprd(+) nonpeptidergic nociceptors display distinctive central arbor morphologies that well correlate with increased synapse transmission efficiency and heightened sensitivity of distal limb skin. Given that peripheral and central arbor formation of Mrgprd(+) neurons co-occurs around the time of birth, we tested whether peripheral cues from different skin areas and/or postnatal reorganization mechanisms could instruct this somatotopic difference among central arbors. We found that, while terminal outgrowth/refinement occurs during early postnatal development in both the skin and the DH, postnatal refinement of central terminals precedes that of peripheral terminals. Furthermore, we used single-cell ablation of Ret to genetically disrupt epidermal innervation of Mrgprd(+) neurons and revealed that the somatotopic difference among their central arbors was unaffected by this manipulation. Finally, we saw that region-specific Mrgprd(+) central terminal arbors are present from the earliest postnatal stages, before skin terminals are evident. In summary, we find that region-specific organization of Mrgprd(+) neuron central arbors is present shortly after initial central terminal formation, which likely develops independently of peripheral target innervation. Our data suggest that either cell-intrinsic and/or DH prepatterning mechanisms are likely to establish this somatotopic difference.",Somatotopic organization of central arbors from nociceptive afferents develops independently of their intact peripheral target innervation.
"All cells obtain 2'-deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis through the activity of a ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). The class I RNRs found in humans and pathogenic bacteria differ in (i) use of Fe(II), Mn(II), or both for activation of the dinuclear-metallocofactor subunit, beta; (ii) reaction of the reduced dimetal center with dioxygen or superoxide for this activation; (iii) requirement (or lack thereof) for a flavoprotein activase, NrdI, to provide the superoxide from O2; and (iv) use of either a stable tyrosyl radical or a high-valent dimetal cluster to initiate each turnover by oxidizing a cysteine residue in the alpha subunit to a radical (Cys*). The use of manganese by bacterial class I, subclass b-d RNRs, which contrasts with the exclusive use of iron by the eukaryotic Ia enzymes, appears to be a countermeasure of certain pathogens against iron deprivation imposed by their hosts. Here, we report a metal-free type of class I RNR (subclass e) from two human pathogens. The Cys* in its alpha subunit is generated by a stable, tyrosine-derived dihydroxyphenylalanine radical (DOPA*) in beta. The three-electron oxidation producing DOPA* occurs in Escherichia coli only if the beta is coexpressed with the NrdI activase encoded adjacently in the pathogen genome. The independence of this new RNR from transition metals, or the requirement for a single metal ion only transiently for activation, may afford the pathogens an even more potent countermeasure against transition metal-directed innate immunity.",Metal-free class Ie ribonucleotide reductase from pathogens initiates catalysis with a tyrosine-derived dihydroxyphenylalanine radical.
"INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery is a treatment option for the obese adolescent. There are three primary surgical procedures: the bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and lap band. The most recent literature was reviewed to examine changes in weight, comorbidities, and complications after bariatric surgery in the adolescent. METHOD: A systematic search was performed to identify original research articles published in the United States between the years of 2000 and 2017 with patients between the ages of 11 and 21 years that provided greater than 30 days of results. RESULTS: A total of 23 articles were identified. Weight loss, improvement in comorbidities, and complications after all procedures were reported. DISCUSSION: Outcomes were not reported in a standardized fashion, creating much difficulty in interpreting and comparing results. The sleeve gastrectomy is increasing in incidence, whereas the lap band is decreasing. Further research is needed to draw more definitive conclusions regarding long-term results in the adolescent undergoing bariatric surgery.",Weight Loss in Adolescents After Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review.
"Anti-obesity medication may help people maintain diet-induced reductions in appetite. The present exploratory analysis assessed the effects of lorcaserin on changes at 24 weeks post-randomization in emotion- and stress-related eating, food cravings and other measures of appetite (i.e. binge eating, cognitive restraint, disinhibition, hunger, preoccupation with eating and fullness). The parent study investigated the efficacy of combined lorcaserin and behavioural treatment in facilitating weight loss maintenance (WLM) in 137 adults (mean age = 46.1 years, 86.1% female, 68.6% black) who had lost >/=5% of initial weight during a 14-week, low-calorie diet (LCD) run-in. Participants were randomly assigned to lorcaserin or placebo and were provided with group WLM counselling sessions. Emotion- and stress-related eating, food cravings and appetite were measured at the start of the LCD (week -14), randomization (0) and week 24. From randomization, lorcaserin-treated participants had significantly greater improvements in emotion- and stress-related eating compared to placebo-treated participants (P = 0.04). However, groups did not differ significantly after randomization in changes in the frequency of food cravings, binge eating or other measures of appetite (Ps > 0.05). Compared to placebo, lorcaserin may improve emotion- and stress-related eating.","A randomized controlled trial of lorcaserin and lifestyle counselling for weight loss maintenance: changes in emotion- and stress-related eating, food cravings and appetite."
"OBJECTIVE: To examine insurance-based disparities in provider-related barriers to care among children in California in the wake of changes to the insurance market resulting from the Affordable Care Act. METHODS: Our sample included 6514 children (ages 0 to 11 years) from the 2014-2016 California Health Interview Survey. We examined parent reports in the past year of 1) having trouble finding a general provider for the child, 2) the child not being accepted by a provider as a new patient, 3) the child's health insurance not being accepted by a provider, or 4) any of the above. Multivariable models estimated the associations of insurance type-Medi-Cal (Medicaid), employer-sponsored insurance, or privately purchased coverage-and parent reports of these problems. RESULTS: Approximately 8% of parents had encountered at least one of these problems. Compared with parents of children with employer-sponsored insurance, parents of children with Medi-Cal or privately purchased coverage had over twice the odds of experiencing at least one of the barriers. Parents of children with Medi-Cal had over twice the odds of being told a provider would not accept their children's coverage or having trouble finding a general provider and 3 times the odds of being told a provider would not accept their children as new patients. Parents of children with privately purchased coverage had over 3 times the odds of being told a provider would not accept their children's coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found significant disparities in provider-related barriers by insurance type among children in California.",Disparities in Pediatric Provider Availability by Insurance Type After the ACA in California.

"BACKGROUND: Treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis remain poor. We aimed to estimate the association of treatment success and death with the use of individual drugs, and the optimal number and duration of treatment with those drugs in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. METHODS: In this individual patient data meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify potentially eligible observational and experimental studies published between Jan 1, 2009, and April 30, 2016. We also searched reference lists from all systematic reviews of treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis published since 2009. To be eligible, studies had to report original results, with end of treatment outcomes (treatment completion [success], failure, or relapse) in cohorts of at least 25 adults (aged >18 years). We used anonymised individual patient data from eligible studies, provided by study investigators, regarding clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes. Using propensity score-matched generalised mixed effects logistic, or linear regression, we calculated adjusted odds ratios and adjusted risk differences for success or death during treatment, for specific drugs currently used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, as well as the number of drugs used and treatment duration. FINDINGS: Of 12 030 patients from 25 countries in 50 studies, 7346 (61%) had treatment success, 1017 (8%) had failure or relapse, and 1729 (14%) died. Compared with failure or relapse, treatment success was positively associated with the use of linezolid (adjusted risk difference 0.15, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.18), levofloxacin (0.15, 0.13 to 0.18), carbapenems (0.14, 0.06 to 0.21), moxifloxacin (0.11, 0.08 to 0.14), bedaquiline (0.10, 0.05 to 0.14), and clofazimine (0.06, 0.01 to 0.10). There was a significant association between reduced mortality and use of linezolid (-0.20, -0.23 to -0.16), levofloxacin (-0.06, -0.09 to -0.04), moxifloxacin (-0.07, -0.10 to -0.04), or bedaquiline (-0.14, -0.19 to -0.10). Compared with regimens without any injectable drug, amikacin provided modest benefits, but kanamycin and capreomycin were associated with worse outcomes. The remaining drugs were associated with slight or no improvements in outcomes. Treatment outcomes were significantly worse for most drugs if they were used despite in-vitro resistance. The optimal number of effective drugs seemed to be five in the initial phase, and four in the continuation phase. In these adjusted analyses, heterogeneity, based on a simulated I(2) method, was high for approximately half the estimates for specific drugs, although relatively low for number of drugs and durations analyses. INTERPRETATION: Although inferences are limited by the observational nature of these data, treatment outcomes were significantly better with use of linezolid, later generation fluoroquinolones, bedaquiline, clofazimine, and carbapenems for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These findings emphasise the need for trials to ascertain the optimal combination and duration of these drugs for treatment of this condition.

"Complexity in genome architecture determines how gene expression programs are established, maintained, and modified from early developmental stages to normal adult phenotypes. Large scale and hierarchical organization of the genome impacts various aspects of cell functions, ranging from X-chromosome inactivation, stem-cell fate determination to transcription, DNA replication, and cellular repair. While chromatin loops and topologically-associated domains represent a basic structural or fundamental unit of chromatin organization, spatio-temporal organization of the genome further creates a complex network of interacting genome patterns, forming chromosomal compartments and chromosome territories. The understanding of human diseases, including cancers, auto-immune disorders, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular diseases, relies on the associated molecular and epigenetic mechanisms. There is a growing interest in the impact of three-dimensional chromatin folding upon the genome structure and function, which gives rise to the question ""What's in the fold?"" and is the main focus of this review. Here we discuss the principles determining the spatial and regulatory relationships between gene regulation and three-dimensional chromatin landscapes, and how changes in chromatin-folding could influence the outcome of genome function in healthy and disease states.","What's in the ""fold""?"
"PURPOSE: Schools undergoing curricular reform are reconsidering the optimal timing of Step 1. This study provides a psychometric investigation of the impact on United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores of changing the timing of Step 1 from after completion of the basic science curricula to after core clerkships. METHOD: Data from four schools that recently moved the examination were analyzed in a pre-post format using examinee scores from three years before and after the change. The sample included scores from 2008 through 2016. Several confounders were addressed, including rising national scores and potential differences in cohort abilities using deviation scores and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) controlling for Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores. A resampling procedure compared study schools' score changes versus similar schools' in the same time period. RESULTS: The ANCOVA indicated postchange Step 1 scores were higher compared with prechange (adjusted difference = 2.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.50-3.83, P < .001; effect size = 0.14) after adjusting for MCAT scores and rising national averages. The average score increase in study schools was larger than changes seen in similar schools. Failure rates also decreased from 2.87% (n = 48) pre change to 0.39% (n = 6) post change (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest moving Step 1 after core clerkships yielded a small increase in scores and a reduction in failure rates. Although these small increases are unlikely to represent meaningful knowledge gains, this demonstration of ""noninferiority"" may allow schools to implement significant curricular reforms.",Moving the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 After Core Clerkships: An Outcomes Analysis.
"The specific contribution of core auditory cortex to auditory perception -such as categorization- remains controversial. To identify a contribution of the primary auditory cortex (A1) to perception, we recorded A1 activity while monkeys reported whether a temporal sequence of tone bursts was heard as having a ""small"" or ""large"" frequency difference. We found that A1 had frequency-tuned responses that habituated, independent of frequency content, as this auditory sequence unfolded over time. We also found that A1 firing rate was modulated by the monkeys' reports of ""small"" and ""large"" frequency differences; this modulation correlated with their behavioral performance. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that A1 contributes to the processes underlying auditory categorization.",The Contribution of Primary Auditory Cortex to Auditory Categorization in Behaving Monkeys.
"Physical inactivity gives rise to numerous diseases and organismal dysfunctions, particularly those related to aging. Musculoskeletal disorders including muscle atrophy, which can result from a sedentary lifestyle, aggravate locomotive malfunction and evoke a vicious circle leading to severe functional disruptions of vital organs such as the brain and cardiovascular system. Although the significance of physical activity is evident, molecular mechanisms behind its beneficial effects are poorly understood. Here, we show that massage-like mechanical interventions modulate immobilization-induced pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages in situ and alleviate muscle atrophy. Local cyclical compression (LCC) on mouse calves, which generates intramuscular pressure waves with amplitude of 50 mmHg, partially restores the myofiber thickness and contracting forces of calf muscles that are decreased by hindlimb immobilization. LCC tempers the increase in the number of cells expressing pro-inflammatory proteins, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), including macrophages in situ The reversing effect of LCC on immobilization-induced thinning of myofibers is almost completely nullified when macrophages recruited from circulating blood are depleted by administration of clodronate liposomes. Furthermore, application of pulsatile fluid shear stress, but not hydrostatic pressure, reduces the expression of MCP-1 in macrophages in vitro Together with the LCC-induced movement of intramuscular interstitial fluid detected by microCT analysis, these results suggest that mechanical modulation of macrophage function is involved in physical inactivity-induced muscle atrophy and inflammation. Our findings uncover the implication of mechanosensory function of macrophages in disuse muscle atrophy, thereby opening a new path to develop a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing mechanical interventions.",Local cyclical compression modulates macrophage function in situ and alleviates immobilization-induced muscle atrophy.
"OBJECTIVE: Evidence suggests using metered dose inhaler (MDI) to treat acute asthma in the Emergency Department reduces length of stay, though methods of implementation are lacking. We modified a treatment pathway to recommend use of MDI for mild-moderate asthma in a pediatric ED. METHODS: A baseline review assessed discharged patients >2 years with an asthma diagnosis and non-emergent Emergency Severity Index triage assessment (3/4). Our multi-disciplinary team developed an intervention to increase MDI use instead of continuous albuterol (CA) using the following: (1) Redesign the asthma pathway and order set recommending MDI for ESI 3/4 patients. (2) Adding a conditional order for Respiratory Therapists to reassess and repeat MDI until patient reached mild assessment. The primary outcome was the percentage discharged within 3 hours, with a goal of a 10% increase compared to pre-intervention. Balancing measures included admission and revisit rates. RESULTS: 7635 patients met eligibility before pathway change; 12,673 were seen in the subsequent 18 months. For target patients, the percentage discharged in <3 hours increased from 39% to 49%; reduction in median length of stay was 33 minutes. We identified special cause variation for reduction in CA use from 43% to 25%; Revisit rate and length of stay for higher-acuity patients did not change; overall asthma admissions decreased by 8%. Changes were sustained for 18 months. CONCLUSION: A change to an ED asthma pathway recommending MDI for mild-moderate asthma led to a rapid and sustained decrease in continuous albuterol use, length of stay, and admission rate.",Improving efficiency of pediatric emergency asthma treatment by using metered dose inhaler.

"Successive adaptation of the bone marrow (BM) from homeostatic hematopoietic microenvironment to a self-reinforcing niche is an integral aspect of leukemogenesis. Yet, the cellular mechanisms underlying these functional alterations remain to be defined. Here, we found that AML incursion precipitates compartmental endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and an unfolded protein response (UPR) in both leukemia and stromal cells. We observed that extracellular vesicles (EV) transmit ER stress in vivo from the AML xenograft to BM stroma, whereby the upregulation of core UPR components drives subsequent osteolineage differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Finally, we show that the underlying mechanism involves quantitative incorporation and cell-cell transfer of Bone Morphogenic Protein 2 (BMP2), a potent osteogenic signal, by AML-EVs. Corroborative studies in AML patient samples support the translational relevance of AML-EVs as a platform for BMP trafficking and source of compartmental crosstalk. Transmissible ER stress was previously identified as a source of chemoresistance in solid tumor models, and this work reveals a role in remodeling the BM niche in AML.",Transmissible ER stress reconfigures the AML bone marrow compartment.
"BACKGROUND: Pathological Skin Picking (PSP) may begin at any age, but the most common age of onset is during adolescence. Age of onset is a potentially useful clinical marker to delineate subtypes of psychiatric disorders. The present study sought to examine empirically defined age of onset groups in adults with PSP and assess whether groups differed on clinical characteristics. METHOD: Participants were 701 adult respondents to an internet survey, who endorsed recurrent skin picking with tissue damage and impairment. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted to identify subtypes of PSP based on age of onset. Then subgroups were compared on demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The best fitting LPA model was a two-class solution comprised of a large group with average age of onset in adolescence (n=650; 92.9% of the sample; Mean age of onset=13.6years) and a small group with average onset in middle adulthood (n=50; 7.1% of the sample; Mean age of onset=42.8years). Relative to the early onset group, the late onset group reported significantly less focused picking, less skin picking-related impairment, lower rates of co-occurring body-focused repetitive behaviors, and trends towards reduced family history of PSP. Individuals in the late onset group also reported increased rates of comorbid depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder, and were more likely to report that initial picking onset seemed related to or followed depression/anxiety and physical illness. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the presence of two distinct PSP age of onset groups: (1) an early onset group with average onset in adolescence, clinical characteristics suggestive of greater picking-related burden and familiality, and a profile more representative of the general PSP population; and (2) a late onset group with average onset in middle adulthood, increased co-occurring affective and trauma conditions, and initial onset associated with or following other mental health and physical problems. Future replication is needed to assess the validity and clinical utility of these subgroups.",A latent profile analysis of age of onset in pathological skin picking.
"The Cardiac Center at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has cared for patients with implanted ventricular assist device (VAD) technology since 1998. Historically, patients requiring VAD support were managed exclusively in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit with the first medically stable transition to the Cardiac Care Unit (step-down) taking place in 2001. Patient management was confined to the inpatient setting, as the primary device used at the time was paracorporeal and not suitable for home use. Continuous-flow devices, such as the HeartWare HVAD, have gained popularity because of miniaturized size and lower profiles of side effects and adverse events, making them more suitable for home use.

"IntroductionSevere fatigue and cognitive dysfunction are frequent symptoms in patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. They can be debilitating, and often do not resolve despite improvement in haemodynamic symptoms. Our analysis was intended to assess clinical outcomes of medication treatment for these symptoms in a large, single-centre paediatric programme.Materials and MethodsWe performed a retrospective review of patients treated for fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Patients aged 18 years or younger at the time of initial diagnosis were included. Patients who had a specific medication ordered five or more times for these symptoms were confirmed by chart review for clinical improvement. Percentage of patients with clinical improvement for each medication and overall for all medications, as well as the number of medications per patient required to achieve improvement, were assessed. Data were analysed based on gender as well. t-Test and chi2 analyses were used to assess for differences between means in variables, or specific variables. RESULTS: A total of 708 patients met study criteria, of whom 517 were treated for fatigue or brain fog. Overall efficacy was 68.8%, with individual medication effectiveness ranging from 53.1 (methylphenidate) to 16.5% (atomoxetine). There was no significant difference in efficacy with respect to gender. The median number of medications used per patient was 2, without gender difference. Therapy was limited by side effects or lack of efficacy.DiscussionMedications are effective in the improvement of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in these patients. However, trials of multiple medications may be needed before achieving clinical improvement.",Therapy for fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.
"Expression profiles of CXC- and CC-chemokines in various forms of tonsillar disease were studied to evaluate whether certain chemokines play a predominant role in a specific subset of tonsillar disease. Total RNA was isolated from 89 biopsies (21 hyperplastic palatine tonsils, 25 adenoids, 16 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils and 27 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils with histological prove of acute inflammation), reverse transcribed and subjected to PCR amplifying IL-8, Gro-alpha, eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 and RANTES. 2% agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a predominance of IL-8 in the chronic inflammatory palatine tonsil group compared to tonsillar hyperplasia. Furthermore, eotaxin-2 was strongly overexpressed in adenoid samples compared to chronic inflammatory specimens. Our data suggest that the majority of diseases related to adenoid formation are mediated via an eotaxin-2 expression, whereas chronic inflammatory tonsillitis is associated with IL-8 upregulation. These data imply that adenoids are related to a Th-2, and chronic inflammatory tonsillitis to a Th-1 based immune response.",Differential chemokine expression patterns in tonsillar disease.

IL-13 levels were associated with protection against pneumonia and intensive care unit (ICU) admission, whereas the IFN-gamma/IL-13 ratio and IL-10 levels were associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and ICU admission. This association was independent of viral load. A skewing of immune responses toward Th2 in transplant patients appears to confer protection from severe influenza infection, independent of viral load.",Cytokine Profiles and Severity of Influenza Infection in Transplant Recipients.
"CONTEXT.-: The College of American Pathologists guidelines recommend testing additional tumor foci in multifocal invasive breast carcinomas for the biomarkers estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and HER2 only if the carcinomas show different morphologies or grades. OBJECTIVE.-: To assess clinical significance of testing for biomarkers in additional tumor foci in multifocal invasive breast tumors. DESIGN.-: Retrospective analysis of 118 patients diagnosed with ipsilateral synchronous multifocal breast carcinomas from January 2015 through March 2016 at Mount Sinai Hospital (New York, New York). RESULTS.-: Eighty-six cases were tested for at least 1 of the 3 biomarkers in additional tumor foci. Fifteen cases (17%) showed discordant staining between the 2 foci for at least one biomarker. Of the 7 of 67 ER-discordant cases (10%), 4 (57%) showed major variation from negative to positive expression, including 3 cases in which a smaller tumor focus was strongly positive for ER whereas the index tumor was negative. Similarly, within the 7 of 67 progesterone receptor-discordant cases (10%), 4 (57%) showed major variation from negative to positive, and in 3 cases with major discordance, the index tumor was negative for progesterone receptor, whereas a smaller focus was positive. A difference in HER2 expression was noted in 5 of 86 cases (6%). In only 5 of the 15 patients (33%) with discordant results, biomarker testing on additional foci would have been offered per the College of American Pathologists recommendations because of differences in histology or grading. Of the remaining 10 patients, 7 (70%) with positive results on smaller foci would have been deprived of appropriate adjuvant systemic treatment if the smaller focus had not been tested. CONCLUSIONS.-: We propose that negative values expressed in the primary tumor be repeated routinely on additional ipsilateral synchronous tumors.",Evaluation of Biomarkers in Multiple Ipsilateral Synchronous Invasive Breast Carcinomas.
"The surface proteins of the mumps virus, the fusion protein (F) and haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), are key factors in mumps pathogenesis and are important targets for the immune response during mumps virus infection. We compared the predicted amino acid sequences of the F and HN genes from Dutch mumps virus samples from the pre-vaccine era (1957-1982) with mumps virus genotype G strains (from 2004 onwards). Genotype G is the most frequently detected mumps genotype in recent outbreaks in vaccinated communities, especially in Western Europe, the USA and Japan. Amino acid differences between the Jeryl Lynn vaccine strains (genotype A) and genotype G strains were predominantly located in known B-cell epitopes and in N-linked glycosylation sites on the HN protein. There were eight variable amino acid positions specific to genotype A or genotype G sequences in five known B-cell epitopes of the HN protein. These differences may account for the reported antigenic differences between Jeryl Lynn and genotype G strains. We also found amino acid differences in and near sites on the HN protein that have been reported to play a role in mumps virus pathogenesis. These differences may contribute to the occurrence of genotype G outbreaks in vaccinated communities.",Differences in antigenic sites and other functional regions between genotype A and G mumps virus surface proteins.
"BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 million new cases of herpes zoster (HZ) occur in the United States annually, including 10%-20% with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). Postherpetic neuralgia, a debilitating pain syndrome occurs in 30% HZ, whereas 50% HZO develop ophthalmic complications. Diplopia from cranial nerve palsy occurs in less than 30% HZO, whereas optic neuropathy is seen in less than 1% HZO. We reviewed recent developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of HZ as well as neurological and ophthalmological complications of relevance to the neuro-ophthalmologist. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched the English language literature on Pubmed and Google scholar for articles relevant to the various sections of this review. RESULTS: Antiviral treatment should be initiated within 48-72 hours of onset of HZ and HZO to decrease pain and reduce complications. We recommend neuroimaging in all patients with neuro-ophthalmic manifestations such as diplopia and acute vision loss. Diagnostic confirmation using polymerase chain reaction and serology on paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples should be obtained in those with neurological signs and symptoms or abnormal imaging. Patients with neurological and/or retinal varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection should be treated promptly with intravenous acyclovir. Patients with isolated optic neuropathy or cranial nerve palsy can be managed with oral antivirals. The prognosis for visual recovery is good for patients with isolated optic neuropathy and excellent for patients with isolated ocular motor cranial nerve palsy. CONCLUSIONS: HZ produces a spectrum of potentially blinding and life-threatening complications that adversely affect quality of life and increase health care costs. Individuals at risk for HZ, such as the elderly and immunocompromised, should be encouraged to receive the highly effective VZV vaccine to prevent HZ and its complications.",Neurological and Ophthalmological Manifestations of Varicella Zoster Virus.
"Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a currently prevalent disease in the US that is projected to become increasingly common as the aging population grows. In recent years, image-based simulations of mitral valve (MV) function have improved significantly, providing new tools to refine IMR treatment. However, clinical implementation of MV simulations has long been hindered as the in vivo MV chordae tendineae (MVCT) geometry cannot be captured with sufficient fidelity for computational modeling. In the current study, we addressed this challenge by developing a method to produce functionally equivalent MVCT models that can be built from the image-based MV leaflet geometry alone. We began our analysis using extant micron-resolution 3D imaging datasets to first build anatomically accurate MV models. We then systematically simplified the native MVCT structure to generate a series of synthetic models by consecutively removing key anatomic features, such as the thickness variations, branching patterns, and chordal origin distributions. In addition, through topology optimization, we identified the minimal structural complexity required to capture the native MVCT behavior. To assess the performance and predictive power of each synthetic model, we analyzed their performance by comparing the mismatch in simulated MV closed shape, as well as the strain and stress tensors, to ground-truth MV models. Interestingly, our results revealed a substantial redundancy in the anatomic structure of native chordal anatomy. We showed that the closing behavior of complete MV apparatus under normal, diseased, and surgically repaired scenarios can be faithfully replicated by a functionally equivalent MVCT model comprised of two representative papillary muscle heads, single strand chords, and a uniform insertion distribution with a density of 15 insertions/cm(2). Hence, even though the complete sub-valvular structure is mostly missing in in vivo MV images, we believe our approach will allow for the development of patient-specific complete MV models for surgical repair planning.",Development of a Functionally Equivalent Model of the Mitral Valve Chordae Tendineae Through Topology Optimization.

"Most cancer patients die as a consequence of distant metastases, which are frequently unresponsive to cancer therapy. This study focuses on the anti-tumorigenic and anti-metastatic properties of tangeretin-zinc oxide quantum dots (Tan-ZnO QDs) against the NCI-H358 cell line. Tan-ZnO QDs are pH-sensitive and capitalize on the acidic pH maintained in the tumor microenvironment; therefore, targeted drug delivery is directed specifically to cancer cells, leaving the normal cells less affected. Tan was loaded into synthesized ZnO QDs, and drug loading was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrometry. Crystalline phase and particle size were measured using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Drug release was evaluated in buffered solutions with differing pH for up to 15h. The results confirmed stable drug release (80%) in an acidic pH. Tan-ZnO QDs induced significant cytotoxicity in NCI-H358 metastatic cells, while not markedly affecting HK-2 human normal cells. Morphology of treated H358 cells analyzed via atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed an increased surface roughness and pores. Further, the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells increased after treatment with Tan-ZnO QDs. DNA fragmentation was also induced after treatment with increasing concentrations of Tan-ZnO QDs in H358 cells. We also confirmed regulation of apoptosis via expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins; G2/M phase cell cycle arrest was observed. Additionally, cell proliferation and migration drastically decreased, and cell invasion and migration, hallmarks of metastasis, were significantly inhibited in H358 cells. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9, markers of metastasis, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a marker of angiogenesis, were significantly downregulated upon treatment with Tan-ZnO QDs. In conclusion, our novel formulation destabilized H358 cells by using its acidic tumor microenvironment, thereby regulating cell apoptosis, proliferation, and metastatic properties.",pH-sensitive tangeretin-ZnO quantum dots exert apoptotic and anti-metastatic effects in metastatic lung cancer cell line.
"Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a common developmental forebrain malformation, is characterized by failure of the cerebrum to completely divide into left and right hemispheres. The etiology of HPE is heterogeneous and a number of environmental and genetic factors have been identified. Cytogenetically visible alterations occur in 25% to 45% of HPE patients and cytogenetic techniques have long been used to study copy number variants (CNVs) in this disorder. The karyotype approach initially demonstrated several recurrent chromosomal anomalies, which led to the identification of HPE-specific loci and, eventually, several major HPE genes. More recently, higher-resolution cytogenetic techniques such as subtelomeric multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and chromosomal microarray have been used to analyze chromosomal anomalies. By using chromosomal microarray, we sought to identify submicroscopic chromosomal deletions and duplications in patients with HPE. In an analysis of 222 individuals with HPE, a deletion or duplication was detected in 107 individuals. Of these 107 individuals, 23 (21%) had variants that were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic by board-certified medical geneticists. We identified multiple patients with deletions in established HPE loci as well as three patients with deletions encompassed by 6q12-q14.3, a CNV previously reported by Bendavid et al. In addition, we identified a new locus, 16p13.2 that warrants further investigation for HPE association. Incidentally, we also found a case of Potocki-Lupski syndrome, a case of Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and multiple cases of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome within our cohort. These data confirm the genetically heterogeneous nature of HPE, and also demonstrate clinical utility of chromosomal microarray in diagnosing patients affected by HPE.",Cytogenetics and holoprosencephaly: A chromosomal microarray study of 222 individuals with holoprosencephaly.

"BACKGROUND: Post-partum depression is associated with substantial morbidity, and improved pharmacological treatment options are urgently needed. We assessed brexanolone injection (formerly SAGE-547 injection), a positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric-acid type A (GABAA) receptors, for the treatment of moderate to severe post-partum depression. METHODS: We did two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials, at 30 clinical research centres and specialised psychiatric units in the USA. Eligible women were aged 18-45 years, 6 months post partum or less at screening, with post-partum depression and a qualifying 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score (>/=26 for study 1; 20-25 for study 2). Women with renal failure requiring dialysis, anaemia, known allergy to allopregnanolone or to progesterone, or medical history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive a single intravenous injection of either brexanolone 90 mug/kg per h (BRX90), brexanolone 60 mug/kg per h (BRX60), or matching placebo for 60 h in study 1, or (1:1) BRX90 or matching placebo for 60 h in study 2. Patients, the study team, site staff, and the principal investigator were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the 17-item HAM-D total score at 60 h, assessed in all patients who started infusion of study drug or placebo, had a valid HAM-D baseline assessment, and had at least one post-baseline HAM-D assessment. The safety population included all randomised patients who started infusion of study drug or placebo. Patients were followed up until day 30. The trials have been completed and are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02942004 (study 1) and NCT02942017 (study 2). FINDINGS: Participants were enrolled between Aug 1, 2016, and Oct 19, 2017, in study 1, and between July 25, 2016, and Oct 11, 2017, in study 2. We screened 375 women simultaneously across both studies, of whom 138 were randomly assigned to receive either BRX90 (n=45), BRX60 (n=47), or placebo (n=46) in study 1, and 108 were randomly assigned to receive BRX90 (n=54) or placebo (n=54) in study 2. In study 1, at 60 h, the least-squares (LS) mean reduction in HAM-D total score from baseline was 19.5 points (SE 1.2) in the BRX60 group and 17.7 points (1.2) in the BRX90 group compared with 14.0 points (1.1) in the placebo group (difference -5.5 [95% CI -8.8 to -2.2], p=0.0013 for the BRX60 group; -3.7 [95% CI -6.9 to -0.5], p=0.0252 for the BRX90 group). In study 2, at 60 h, the LS mean reduction in HAM-D total score from baseline was 14.6 points (SE 0.8) in the BRX90 group compared with 12.1 points (SE 0.8) for the placebo group (difference -2.5 [95% CI -4.5 to -0.5], p=0.0160). In study 1, 19 patients in the BRX60 group and 22 patients in the BRX90 group had adverse events compared with 22 patients in the placebo group. In study 2, 25 patients in the BRX90 group had adverse events compared with 24 patients in the placebo group. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the brexanolone groups were headache (n=7 BRX60 group and n=6 BRX90 group vs n=7 placebo group for study 1; n=9 BRX90 group vs n=6 placebo group for study 2), dizziness (n=6 BRX60 group and n=6 BRX90 group vs n=1 placebo group for study 1; n=5 BRX90 group vs n=4 placebo group for study 2), and somnolence (n=7 BRX60 group and n=2 BRX90 group vs n=3 placebo group for study 1; n=4 BRX90 group vs n=2 placebo group for study 2). In study 1, one patient in the BRX60 group had two serious adverse events (suicidal ideation and intentional overdose attempt during follow-up). In study 2, one patient in the BRX90 group had two serious adverse events (altered state of consciousness and syncope), which were considered to be treatment related. INTERPRETATION: Administration of brexanolone injection for post-partum depression resulted in significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HAM-D total score at 60 h compared with placebo, with rapid onset of action and durable treatment response during the study period. Our results suggest that brexanolone injection is a novel therapeutic drug for post-partum depression that has the potential to improve treatment options for women with this disorder.

"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Restrictive eligibility criteria have hampered enrollment into trials for new drugs for youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We utilized Pediatric Diabetes Consortium (PDC) T2D Registry enrollment data to estimate the percentage of patients who would be excluded from current T2D trials based on out-of-range HbA1c levels. We also examined whether well-controlled patients could be included because baseline HbA1c would rise during a 6 to 12-month study if assigned to control group. METHODS: Clinical characteristics and HbA1c levels were collected from 956 T2D patients aged 10 to <18 years upon Registry enrollment. HbA1c levels were also analyzed in 6-month intervals during the first 30 months of T2D duration. RESULTS: There was an approximately 2:1 ratio of females to males; the majority were obese and from economically disadvantaged minority families. On enrollment in the Registry, 53% of patients would be excluded from current trials because HbA1c levels were either <6.5% (<48 mmol/mol) (37%) or >10.5% (>91 mmol/mol) (16%). Furthermore, in patients with HbA1c levels <6.5% (<48 mmol/mol) and T2D duration between 6 and 30 months, mean HbA1c levels increased by 0.6% (6 mmol/mol) and 0.9% (10 mmol/mol) over the subsequent 6 and 12 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Eligibility criteria for current clinical trials still exclude a large proportion of pediatric T2D patients because of HbA1c levels. Including patients with HbA1c <6.5% (<48 mmol/mol) would enhance recruitment and allow comparisons of the investigational treatment with placebo-assigned subjects in whom HbA1c levels would on average increase during the 6 to 12 months of the trial.",Eligibility for clinical trials is limited for youth with type 2 diabetes: Insights from the Pediatric Diabetes Consortium T2D Clinic Registry.
"Acne is a common skin disease that predominantly affects teenagers and young adults. Systemic antibiotic therapy, including tetracyclines, macrolides, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is indicated in moderate-to-severe inflammatory disease. However, in certain cases, these antibiotics and other commonly prescribed treatments including oral contraceptives, spironolactone, and isotretinoin may be prohibited, especially in cases of pregnancy and drug intolerance.

"The largest diversity of neural lineages generated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) occurs early after birth and is regulated in a spatiotemporal manner depending on the expression of specific transcriptional cues. Transcriptomics and fate-mapping approaches were employed to explore the relationship between regional expression of transcription factors by neural stem cells (NSCs) and the specification of distinct neural lineages. Our results support an early priming of NSCs for the genesis of defined cell types depending on their spatial location in the SVZ and identify HOPX as a marker of a subpopulation primed toward astrocytic fates. Manipulation of HOPX expression, however, showed no effect on astrogenesis but resulted in marked changes in the number of NSCs and of their progenies. Taken together, our results highlight transcriptional and spatial heterogeneity of postnatal NSCs and reveal a key role for HOPX in controlling SVZ germinal activity.",HOPX Defines Heterogeneity of Postnatal Subventricular Zone Neural Stem Cells.

"BACKGROUND: The number of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients requiring heart transplantation (HT) continues to grow, and if they survive the first year after transplant, their long-term survival is at least equivalent to non-ACHD patients. The 1-year survival of ACHD patients with HT remains lower than non-ACHD patients. We evaluated the affect of transplant center volume on 1-year survival of ACHD patients. We analyzed United Network of Organ Sharing patients (age >/=18 years) who underwent their first orthotopic HT between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015, to assess the association between transplant center volume and 1-year survival of ACHD patients. RESULTS: We identified 827 ACHD patients at 113 centers who underwent HT during the study period. The average age of the recipients and donors was 36 +/- 13 years (60% men and 84% Caucasian) and 28 +/- 11 (63% men and 66% Caucasian), respectively. Of the ACHD patients undergoing HT, 27% (n=60) were done at low-volume centers, 30% (n=10) were reported at high-volume centers, and the remaining (n=43) were at medium-volume centers. A total of 96 patients died within 30 days, including 37 (16.7%) at low-volume, 37 (10.2%) at medium-volume, and 22 (9.0%) at high-volume centers (p=0.019). The average unadjusted Kaplan-Meier 30-day survival at low-volume centers was 83% +/- 2%, which was significantly lower than medium-volume (90% +/- 1%) and high-volume (91% +/- 2%) centers (log-rank p < 0.05). Within 1 year, 154 patients had died, including 56 (36.4%) at low-volume, 60 (38.9%) at medium-volume, and 38 (24.7%) at high-volume centers (p=0.011). Average unadjusted Kaplan-Meier 1-year survival at low-volume centers was 75% +/- 3%, which was significantly lower than medium-volume (83% +/- 2%) and high-volume (84% +/- 2%) centers (log-rank p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 30-day and 1-year survival of ACHD patients undergoing HT is partly influenced by overall transplant center volume and, potentially, volume of ACHD HTs, with low-volume centers performing poorly relative to medium-volume and high-volume centers. The role of peri-operative care and multidisciplinary management in improving survival at low-volume centers required further investigations.",Center volume and post-transplant survival among adults with congenital heart disease.
"OBJECTIVE: To delineate the electroclinical features of SCN8A infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE13, OMIM #614558). METHODS: Twenty-two patients, aged 19 months to 22 years, underwent electroclinical assessment. RESULTS: Sixteen of 22 patients had mildly delayed development since birth. Drug-resistant epilepsy started at a median age of 4 months, followed by developmental slowing, pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs (22/22), movement disorders (12/22), cortical blindness (17/22), sialorrhea, and severe gastrointestinal symptoms (15/22), worsening during early childhood and plateauing at age 5 to 9 years. Death occurred in 4 children, following extreme neurologic deterioration, at 22 months to 5.5 years. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus recurred in 14 of 22 patients. The most effective antiepileptic drugs were oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and benzodiazepines. EEG showed background deterioration, epileptiform abnormalities with a temporo-occipital predominance, and posterior delta/beta activity correlating with visual impairment. Video-EEG documented focal seizures (FS) (22/22), spasm-like episodes (8/22), cortical myoclonus (8/22), and myoclonic absences (1/22). FS typically clustered and were prolonged (<20 minutes) with (1) cyanosis, hypomotor, and vegetative semiology, sometimes unnoticed, followed by (2) tonic-vibratory and (3) (hemi)-clonic manifestations +/- evolution to a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure. FS had posterior-temporal/occipital onset, slowly spreading and sometimes migrating between hemispheres. Brain MRI showed progressive parenchymal atrophy and restriction of the optic radiations. CONCLUSIONS: SCN8A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy has strikingly consistent electroclinical features, suggesting a global progressive brain dysfunction primarily affecting the temporo-occipital regions. Both uncontrolled epilepsy and developmental compromise contribute to the profound impairment (increasing risk of death) during early childhood, but stabilization occurs in late childhood.",The phenotype of SCN8A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.
"Numerous studies have attributed the psychopathology of anxiety and stress disorders to maladaptive behavioral responses such as an inability to extinguish fear. Therefore, understanding neural substrates of fear extinction is imperative for developing more effective therapies for anxiety and stress disorders. Although several studies indicated a role for cholinergic transmission and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in anxiety and stress disorder symptomatology, very little is known about the specific contribution of nAChRs in the fear extinction process. In the present study, we first examined the involvement of several brain regions essential for fear extinction (i.e., dorsal and ventral hippocampus, dHPC and vHPC; infralimbic, IL, and prelimbic, PL of the medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC; basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, BLA) in the impairing effects of a nAChR agonist, nicotine, on contextual fear extinction in mice. Our results showed that systemic administration of nicotine during contextual fear extinction increased c-fos expression in the vHPC and BLA while not affecting dHPC, IL or PL. In line with these results, local nicotine infusions into the vHPC, but not dHPC, resulted in impaired contextual fear extinction. Interestingly, we found that local nicotine infusions into the PL also resulted in impairment of contextual fear extinction. Second, we measured the protein levels of the GABA synthesizing enzymes GAD65 and GAD67 in the dHPC and vHPC during contextual fear extinction. Our results showed that in the group that received acute nicotine, both GAD65 and GAD67 protein levels were downregulated in the vHPC, but not in dHPC. This effect was negatively correlated with the level of freezing response during fear extinction suggesting that the downregulated GAD65/67 levels were associated with disrupted fear extinction. Finally, using c-fos/GAD65/67 double immunofluorescence, we showed that nicotine mainly increased c-fos expression in non-GABAergic ventral hippocampal cells, indicating that acute nicotine increases vHPC excitability. Overall, our results suggest that acute nicotine's impairing effects on fear extinction are associated with ventral hippocampal disinhibition. Therefore, these results further our understanding of the interaction between nicotine addiction and anxiety and stress disorders by describing novel neural mechanisms mediating fear extinction.",Nicotine modulates contextual fear extinction through changes in ventral hippocampal GABAergic function.
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fascial plane blocks are rapidly emerging to provide safe, feasible alternatives to epidural analgesia for thoracic and abdominal pain. We define a new option for chest wall and upper abdominal analgesia, termed the rhomboid intercostal and subserratus plane (RISS) block. The RISS tissue plane extends deep to the erector spinae muscle medially and deep to the serratus anterior muscle laterally. We describe a 2-part proof-of-concept study to validate the RISS block, including a cadaveric study to evaluate injectate spread and a retrospective case series to assess dermatomal coverage and analgesic efficacy. METHODS: For the cadaveric portion of the study, bilateral ultrasound-guided RISS blocks were performed on 6 fresh cadavers with 30 mL of 0.5% methylcellulose with india ink. For the retrospective case series, we present 15 patients who underwent RISS block or RISS catheter insertion for heterogeneous indications including abdominal surgery, rib fractures, chest tube-associated pain, or postoperative incisional chest wall pain. RESULTS: In the cadaveric specimens, we identified staining of the lateral branches of the intercostal nerves from T3 to T9 reaching the posterior primary rami deep to the erector spinae muscle medially. In the clinical case series, dermatomal coverage was observed in the anterior hemithorax with visual analog pain scores less than 5 in patients who underwent both single-shot and continuous catheter infusions. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary cadaveric and clinical data suggest that RISS block anesthetizes the lateral cutaneous branches of the thoracic intercostal nerves and can be used in multiple clinical settings for chest wall and upper abdominal analgesia.",Rhomboid Intercostal and Subserratus Plane Block: A Cadaveric and Clinical Evaluation.

"Achilles tendon ruptures are common injuries that often lead to long-term functional deficits. Despite the prevalence of these injuries, the mechanism responsible for limited function has not yet been established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to present preliminary findings that support a hypothesis that skeletal muscle remodeling is the driving factor of poor outcomes in some patients. Biomechanical and ultrasonography assessments were performed on a patient that presented with poor functional outcomes 2.5years after a surgically-repaired acute Achilles tendon rupture. Single-leg heel raise height was decreased by 75% in the affected limb (3.0cm compared to 11.9cm) while walking mechanics showed no deficits. Ultrasonography revealed that the affected medial gastrocnemius muscle was less thick and had shorter, more pennate fascicles compared to the unaffected limb. A simple computational model of a maximal-effort plantarflexion contraction was employed to test the implications of changes in muscle architecture on single-leg heel raise function. Subject-specific measurements of fascicle length and pennation were input into the model, which supported these architectural parameters as being drivers of heel raise function. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that an Achilles tendon rupture elicits changes in skeletal muscle architecture, which reduces the amount of work and power the joint can generate. This multidisciplinary framework of biomechanical, imaging, and computational modeling provides a unique platform for studying the complex interactions between structure and function in patients recovering from Achilles tendon injuries.",Functional deficits may be explained by plantarflexor remodeling following Achilles tendon rupture repair: Preliminary findings.
"OBJECTIVES: To present the recommendations and supporting literature for RBC transfusions in critically ill children with bleeding developed by the Pediatric Critical Care Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative. DESIGN: Consensus conference series of international, multidisciplinary experts in RBC transfusion management of critically ill children. METHODS: The panel of 38 experts developed evidence-based and, when evidence was lacking, expert-based clinical recommendations as well as research priorities for RBC transfusions in critically ill children. The bleeding subgroup included five experts. Electronic searches were conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases from 1980 to May 2017. Agreement was obtained using the Research and Development/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method. RESULTS: Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative Consensus Conference experts developed a total of six recommendations focused on transfusion in the critically ill child with acute bleeding. In critically ill children with nonlife-threatening bleeding, we recommend giving a RBC transfusion for a hemoglobin concentration less than 5 g/dL, and be considered for a hemoglobin concentration between 5 and 7 g/dL. In critically ill children with hemorrhagic shock, we suggest that RBCs, plasma and platelets transfusion ratio between 2:1:1 to 1:1:1 until the bleeding is no longer life-threatening. We recommend future studies to develop physiologic and laboratory measures to indicate the need for RBC transfusions, and to determine if goal directed hemostatic resuscitation improves survival. Finally, we recommend future studies to determine if low titer group O whole blood is more efficacious and safe compared with reconstituted whole blood in children with hemorrhagic shock. CONCLUSIONS: The Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative Consensus Conference developed pediatric specific recommendations regarding RBC transfusion management in the critically ill child with acute bleeding, as well as recommendations to help guide future research priorities.",Recommendations on RBC Transfusion in Critically Ill Children With Nonlife-Threatening Bleeding or Hemorrhagic Shock From the Pediatric Critical Care Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative.
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and fatal motor neuron disease. Diagnosis typically occurs in the fifth decade of life and the disease progresses rapidly leading to death within ~ 2-5 years of symptomatic onset. There is no cure, and the few available treatments offer only a modest extension in patient survival. A protein central to ALS is the nuclear RNA/DNA-binding protein, TDP-43. In > 95% of ALS patients, TDP-43 is cleared from the nucleus and forms phosphorylated protein aggregates in the cytoplasm of affected neurons and glia. We recently defined that poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) activity regulates TDP-43-associated toxicity. PAR is a posttranslational modification that is attached to target proteins by PAR polymerases (PARPs). PARP-1 and PARP-2 are the major enzymes that are active in the nucleus. Here, we uncovered that the motor neurons of the ALS spinal cord were associated with elevated nuclear PAR, suggesting elevated PARP activity. Veliparib, a small-molecule inhibitor of nuclear PARP-1/2, mitigated the formation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates in mammalian cells. In primary spinal-cord cultures from rat, Veliparib also inhibited TDP-43-associated neuronal death. These studies uncover that PAR activity is misregulated in the ALS spinal cord, and a small-molecular inhibitor of PARP-1/2 activity may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of ALS and related disorders associated with abnormal TDP-43 homeostasis.",Nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) activity is a therapeutic target in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

"BACKGROUND: Active daily surveillance of central-line days (CLDs) in the assessment of rates of central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) is time-consuming and burdensome for healthcare workers. Sampling of denominator data is a method that could reduce the time necessary to conduct active surveillance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of various sampling strategies in the estimation of CLABSI rates in adult and pediatric units in Greece. METHODS: Daily denominator data were collected across Greece for 6 consecutive months in 33 units: 11 adult units, 4 pediatric intensive care units (PICUs), 12 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), and 6 pediatric oncology units. Overall, 32 samples were evaluated using the following strategies: (1) 1 fixed day per week, (2) 2 fixed days per week, and (3) 1 fixed week per month. The CLDs for each month were estimated as follows: (number of sample CLDs/number of sampled days) x 30. The estimated CLDs were used to calculate CLABSI rates. The accuracy of the estimated CLABSI rates was assessed by calculating the percentage error (PE): [(observed CLABSI rates - estimated CLABSI rates)/observed CLABSI rates]. RESULTS: Compared to other strategies, sampling over 2 fixed days per week provided the most accurate estimates of CLABSI rates for all types of units. Percentage of estimated CLABSI rates with PE </=+/-5% using the strategy of 2 fixed days per week ranged between 74.6% and 88.7% in NICUs. This range was 79.4%-94.1% in pediatric onology units, 62.5%-91.7% in PICUs, and 80.3%-92.4% in adult units. Further evaluation with intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots indicated that the estimated CLABSI rates were reliable. CONCLUSION: Sampling over 2 fixed days per week provides a valid alternative to daily collection of CLABSI denominator data. Adoption of such a monitoring method could be an important step toward better and less burdensome infection control and prevention.",Surveillance for central-line-associated bloodstream infections: Accuracy of different sampling strategies.

"We describe two cases of acute-onset erythema, peeling, and pruritus or tenderness isolated to the palmar surface of the hands. A detailed exposure history revealed significant periods of contact with homemade slime; given the clinical findings and timing of exposure, acute contact dermatitis of the hands was suspected. Symptoms and clinical findings resolved after avoidance of the suspected causative contactants. There are few if any reported cases of contact dermatitis to homemade slime in the literature; this serves to highlight the importance of a thorough exposure history in the evaluation of hand dermatitis.",A slime of the times: Two cases of acute irritant contact dermatitis from homemade slime.
Ultrasound is the most commonly used imaging technique for the evaluation of ovarian and other adnexal lesions. The interpretation of sonographic findings is variable because of inconsistency in descriptor terminology used among reporting clinicians. The use of vague terms that are inconsistently applied can lead to significant differences in interpretation and subsequent management strategies. A committee was formed under the direction of the ACR initially to create a standardized lexicon for ovarian lesions with the goal of improving the quality and communication of imaging reports between ultrasound examiners and referring clinicians. The ultimate objective will be to apply the lexicon to a risk stratification classification for consistent follow-up and management in clinical practice. This white paper describes the consensus process in the creation of a standardized lexicon for ovarian and adnexal lesions and the resultant lexicon.,Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting Lexicon for Ultrasound: A White Paper of the ACR Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System Committee.
"High-density electroencephalography (EEG) was used to examine the utility of the P1 event-related potential (ERP) as a marker of visual motion sensitivity to luminance defined low-spatial frequency drifting gratings in 16 children with autism and 16 neurotypical children. Children with autism displayed enhanced sensitivity to large, high-contrast low-spatial frequency stimuli as indexed by significantly shorter P1 response latencies to large vs. small gratings. The current study also found that children with autism had larger amplitude responses to large gratings irrespective of contrast. A linear regression established that P1 adaptive mean amplitude for large, high-contrast sinusoidal gratings significantly predicted hyperresponsiveness item mean scores on the Sensory Experiences Questionnaire for children with autism, but not for neurotypical children. We conclude that children with autism have differences in the mechanisms that underlie low-level visual processing potentially related to altered visual spatial suppression or contrast gain control.",Visually Evoked Response Differences to Contrast and Motion in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
"INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the association of graft-related surgical factors and patient characteristics with the odds of arthrofibrosis after primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). METHODS: A retrospective case-control study assessed consecutive patients who underwent primary ACL-R in one tertiary pediatric hospital. Each arthrofibrosis case was matched to three controls for sex, calendar year, and age at the time of ACL-R, as well as the primary surgeon. Conditional multivariable logistic regression assessed the independent association of graft diameter, time from injury to ACL-R, concomitant knee pathologies, and body mass index. RESULTS: Twenty arthrofibrosis cases of 1,121 ACL-R patients (incidence 1.8%) were matched to 60 controls resulting in the mean age of 14.5 years. An increase of 1 mm graft diameter was associated with 3.2-times increased odds of arthrofibrosis. Other variables were not independently associated with arthrofibrosis. CONCLUSION: For young patients, the decision on the graft size must consider the possibility of arthrofibrosis with a larger graft versus reinjury with a smaller graft.",Association of the Graft Size and Arthrofibrosis in Young Patients After Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
"PURPOSE: To review the literature on persistent placoid maculopathy. METHODS: Several databases were searched for all years for ""persistent placoid maculopathy."" RESULTS: A total of 21 unique patients were identified (most commonly Caucasian men in their 50s and 60s). Mean +/- SD age at time of presentation was 58.6 +/- 6.9 years of age, and follow-up time was 29.2 +/- 51.9 months. Thirty-three (79%) eyes had subjective symptoms on presentation. Five (24%) patients presented with a prodrome, and four (19%) patients had vitreous cell. Mean +/- SD logarithm of minimal angle of resolution presenting versus final vision was 0.48 +/- 0.50 (Snellen equivalent, 20/60) versus 0.63 +/- 0.52 (Snellen equivalent, 20/84). Systemic inflammation and autoimmune disease were associated with worse presenting and final vision. Persistent placoid maculopathy characteristic imaging features that aid in diagnosing this rare clinical entity include the following: 1) plaque-like hypopigmented, white/yellowish foveal/perifoveal lesions on color fundus photography; 2) early hypofluorescence and late ""fill-in"" or staining on fluorescein angiography; 3) persistent hypocyanescence on indocyanine green angiography; and 4) choriocapillaris hyposignal on optical coherence tomography angiography. Choroidal neovascularization was present in 50% of eyes, with 62% diagnosed at presentation. Although choroidal neovascularization is typically responsive to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections, it is associated with poor visual outcome. Systemic steroids are generally used as first-line agents with addition of other immunomodulatory medications if the disease is refractory or recurrent. CONCLUSION: Precise disease pathophysiology of persistent placoid maculopathy has not been elucidated but most probably relates to selective choriocapillaris hypoperfusion/ischemia/vasculitis. Combination of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections and immunosuppressive medications may be effective in controlling disease activity and limiting development of sight-threatening complications.",PERSISTENT PLACOID MACULOPATHY: A Systematic Review.
"OBJECTIVES: Determine whether words contained in unsolicited patient complaints differentiate physicians with and without neurocognitive disorders (NCD). METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study using data from 144 healthcare organizations that participate in the Patient Advocacy Reporting System program. Cases (physicians with probable or possible NCD) and two comparison groups of 60 physicians each (matched for age/sex and site/number of unsolicited patient complaints) were identified from 33,814 physicians practicing at study sites. We compared the frequency of words in patient complaints related to an NCD diagnostic domain between cases and our two comparison groups. RESULTS: Individual words were all statistically more likely to appear in patient complaints for cases (73% of cases had at least one such word) compared to age/sex matched (8%, p < 0.001 using Pearson's chi(2) test, chi(2) = 30.21, df = 1) and site/complaint matched comparisons (18%, p < 0.001 using Pearson's chi(2) test, chi(2) = 17.51, df = 1). Cases were significantly more likely to have at least one complaint with any word describing NCD than the two comparison groups combined (conditional logistic model adjusted odds ratio 20.0 [95% confidence interval 4.9-81.7]). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of words in unsolicited patient complaints found that descriptions of interactions with physicians with NCD were significantly more likely to include words from one of the diagnostic domains for NCD than were two different comparison groups. Further research is needed to understand whether patients might provide information for healthcare organizations interested in identifying professionals with evidence of cognitive impairment.",Unsolicited Patient Complaints Identify Physicians with Evidence of Neurocognitive Disorders.

"An essential advantage during eukaryotic cell evolution was the acquisition of a network of mitochondria as a source of energy for cell metabolism and contrary to conventional wisdom, functional mitochondria are essential for the cancer cell. Multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology beyond bioenergetics support transformation including mitochondrial biogenesis, fission and fusion dynamics, cell death susceptibility, oxidative stress regulation, metabolism, and signaling. In cancer, the metabolism of cells is reprogrammed for energy generation from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and impacts cancer mitochondrial function. Furthermore cancer cells can also modulate energy metabolism within the cancer microenvironment including immune cells and induce ""metabolic anergy"" of antitumor immune response. Classical approaches targeting the mitochondria of cancer cells usually aim at inducing changing energy metabolism or directly affecting functions of mitochondrial antiapoptotic proteins but most of such approaches miss the required specificity of action and carry important side effects. Several types of cancers harbor somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations and specific immune response to mutated mitochondrial proteins has been observed. An attractive alternative way to target the mitochondria in cancer cells is the induction of an adaptive immune response against mutated mitochondrial proteins. Here, we review the cancer cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms through which mitochondria influence all steps of oncogenesis, with a focus on the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial DNA mutations or Tumor Associated Mitochondria Antigens using the immune system.",Targeting mitochondria in cancer: current concepts and immunotherapy approaches.
"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disorder causing progressive muscle degeneration. Although cardiomyopathy is a leading mortality cause in DMD patients, the mechanisms underlying heart failure are not well understood. Previously, we showed that NF-kappaB exacerbates DMD skeletal muscle pathology by promoting inflammation and impairing new muscle growth. Here, we show that NF-kappaB is activated in murine dystrophic (mdx) hearts, and that cardiomyocyte ablation of NF-kappaB rescues cardiac function. This physiological improvement is associated with a signature of upregulated calcium genes, coinciding with global enrichment of permissive H3K27 acetylation chromatin marks and depletion of the transcriptional repressors CCCTC-binding factor, SIN3 transcription regulator family member A, and histone deacetylase 1. In this respect, in DMD hearts, NF-kappaB acts differently from its established role as a transcriptional activator, instead promoting global changes in the chromatin landscape to regulate calcium genes and cardiac function.",NF-kappaB inhibition rescues cardiac function by remodeling calcium genes in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy model.
"Background: Surgical outcomes following isolated posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR) have been noted to be less satisfactory than the anterior cruciate ligament. Limited understanding of optimal rehabilitation has been implicated as a contributing factor. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this review was to gather the literature related to isolated PCLR rehabilitation, extract and summarize current rehabilitation guidelines, identify timeframes and functional measurements associated with common rehabilitation topics and provide recommendations for future research. Study Design: Literature review. Methods: A literature review was performed for scientific publications that include a detailed rehabilitation program following isolated PCLR, published between January 2005 and March 2018. Data related to weight-bearing, knee range of motion (ROM), brace usage, specific exercise recommendations and suggestions for return to running and sport activities were extracted and categorized. Results: A total of 44 articles met inclusion criteria. Post-operative weight-bearing was discussed in 35 articles with recommendations ranging from no restriction to 12 weeks of limitations. Forty-two articles recommended the use of immediate post-operative bracing, the majority of which positioned the knee in full extension, with duration of use ranging from one to 12 weeks post-operatively. Although 30 articles offered detailed descriptions of ROM activity, there was significant variability in timing of initiation, angular excursion and progression of range of motion. Suggested timeframes for returning to sports activity ranged from four to 12 months, with only four articles providing specific objective strength or functional performance criteria necessary for progression. Conclusions: There is substantial variation in nearly all aspects of published descriptors of rehabilitation following isolated PCLR. Most protocols are based upon biomechanical principles and clinical expertise, relying solely on timeframe from surgery to support rehabilitation decision making. Evidence to compare patient outcomes with specific loading, ROM progression and exercise strategies is currently lacking. Only a small number of protocols incorporate the use of specific objective performance goals to facilitate return to sport decision making.",REHABILITATION FOLLOWING ISOLATED POSTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION: A LITERATURE REVIEW OF PUBLISHED PROTOCOLS.

"Phylogeny estimation is difficult for closely related populations and species, especially if they have been exchanging genes. We present a hierarchical Bayesian, Markov-chain Monte Carlo method with a state space that includes all possible phylogenies in a full Isolation-with-Migration model framework. The method is based on a new type of genealogy augmentation called a ""hidden genealogy"" that enables efficient updating of the phylogeny. This is the first likelihood-based method to fully incorporate directional gene flow and genetic drift for estimation of a species or population phylogeny. Application to human hunter-gatherer populations from Africa revealed a clear phylogenetic history, with strong support for gene exchange with an unsampled ghost population, and relatively ancient divergence between a ghost population and modern human populations, consistent with human/archaic divergence. In contrast, a study of five chimpanzee populations reveals a clear phylogeny with several pairs of populations having exchanged DNA, but does not support a history with an unsampled ghost population.",Phylogeny Estimation by Integration over Isolation with Migration Models.

"AIMS: The Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Research Consortium was established by the National Institutes of Health in 2015 to expand research beyond the detection and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) to the promotion and preservation of bladder health and prevention of LUTS in girls and women. While many multi-disciplinary scientific networks focus on pelvic floor dysfunction and LUTS, the PLUS Consortium stands alone in its focus on prevention. This article describes the PLUS approach to developing a conceptual framework to guide the Consortium's initial prevention research agenda. METHODS: The conceptual framework was informed by traditional social ecological models of public health, biopsychosocial models of health, Glass and McAtee's Society-Behavior-Biology Nexus, and the World Health Organization's conceptual framework for action on the social determinants of health. RESULTS: The PLUS conceptual framework provides a foundation for developing prevention interventions that have the greatest likelihood of promoting and preserving bladder health among diverse populations. CONCLUSIONS: PLUS Consortium work is premised on the notion that programs, practices, and policies designed to promote health will have optimal impact if the conceptual foundation upon which efforts are based is comprehensive and informed by multiple disciplines. The PLUS conceptual framework is broadly applicable to domains of health that have historically focused on the treatment of illness and symptoms rather than the promotion of health. It is also applicable to domains of health that have been examined from a predominantly biological or social ecological perspective, without integration of both perspectives.",The Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) in girls and women: Developing a conceptual framework for a prevention research agenda.

"The R-spondin family of proteins are Wnt agonists, and the complete embryonic disruption of Rspo2 results in skeletal developmental defects that recapitulate the phenotype observed with Lrp5/6 deficiency. Previous work has shown that R-spondin-2 (Rspo2, RSPO2) is both highly expressed in Wnt-stimulated pre-osteoblasts and its overexpression induces osteoblast differentiation in the same cells, supporting its putative role as a positive autocrine regulator of osteoblastogenesis. However, the role of Rspo2 in regulating osteoblastogenesis and bone formation in postnatal bone has not been explored. Here we show that limb-bud progenitor cells from Rspo2 knockout mice undergo reduced mineralization during osteoblastogenesis in vitro and have a corresponding alteration in their osteogenic gene expression profile. We also generated the first Rspo2 conditional knockout (Rspo2(floxed)) mouse and disrupted Rspo2 expression in osteoblast-lineage cells by crossing to the Osteocalcin-Cre mouse line (Ocn-Cre + Rspo2(f/f)). Ocn-Cre + Rspo2(f/f) male and female mice at 1, 3, and 6 months were examined. Ocn-Cre + Rspo2(f/f) mice are decreased in overall body size compared to their control littermates and have decreased bone mass. Histomorphometric analysis of 1-month-old mice revealed a similar number of osteoblasts and mineralizing surface per bone surface with a simultaneous decrease in mineral apposition and bone formation rates. Consistent with this observation, serum osteocalcin in 3-month-old Ocn-Cre + Rspo2(f/f) was reduced, and bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells from Ocn-Cre + Rspo2(f/f) mice undergo less mineralization in vitro. Finally, gene expression analysis and immunohistochemistry of mature bone shows reduced beta-catenin signaling in Ocn-Cre + Rspo2(f/f). Overall, RSPO2 reduces osteoblastogenesis and mineralization, leading to reduced bone mass.",R-spondin-2 is a Wnt agonist that regulates osteoblast activity and bone mass.
": Ewing sarcoma is the second most common sarcoma of the bone, afflicting predominantly the pediatric population. Although patients with localized disease exhibit favorable survival rates, patients with metastatic disease suffer a dismal 5-year rate of approximately 25%. Thus, there is a great need to develop treatments to combat the disseminated disease. Ubiquitin-specific protease 6 (USP6/TRE17) has been implicated as the key etiologic factor in several benign mesenchymal tumors, including nodular fasciitis and aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC). However, the role of USP6 in the biology of malignant entities remains unexplored. Previously, it was observed that USP6 is sufficient to drive formation of tumors mimicking ABC and nodular fasciitis, and that it functions through JAK1/STAT3 signaling. However, in the context of Ewing sarcoma, USP6 does not enhance the transformation, but rather triggers an IFN response signature, both in cultured Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro and in clinical specimens in vivo. Not only does USP6 independently induce activation of the IFN signaling mediators, JAK1 and STAT1, but it also renders Ewing sarcoma cells exquisitely responsive to exogenous IFNs, potentiating activation of STAT1 and STAT3. Furthermore, IFNbeta (a type I IFN) induces apoptosis specifically in USP6-positive but not USP6-negative Ewing sarcoma cells. Finally, apoptosis is mediated through the proapoptotic ligand TRAIL, which is synergistically induced by type I IFN and USP6. IMPLICATIONS: These findings provide the first insights into USP6 functions in a clinically relevant malignant entity, and raise the possibility of using IFN for targeting USP6-positive Ewing sarcoma.",USP6 Confers Sensitivity to IFN-Mediated Apoptosis through Modulation of TRAIL Signaling in Ewing Sarcoma.
"BACKGROUND: We sought to determine whether maternal Medicaid retention influences child Medicaid retention because caregivers play a critical role in assuring children's health access. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal prospective cohort study of a convenience sample of 604 Medicaid-eligible mother-child dyads followed from the infant's birth through 24 months of age with parent surveys. Individual enrollment status was abstracted from administrative Medicaid eligibility files. Generalized estimating equations quantified the effect of maternal Medicaid enrollment status on child Medicaid retention, adjusting for relevant covariates. Because varying lengths of gaps may have different effects on child health outcomes, Medicaid enrollment status was further categorized by length of gap: any gap, > 14-days, and > 60-days. RESULTS: This cohort consists primarily of African-American (94%), unmarried mothers (88%), with a mean age of 23.2 years. In multivariable analysis, children whose mothers experienced any gaps in coverage had 12.6 times greater odds of experiencing gaps when compared to children whose mothers were continuously enrolled. Use of varying thresholds to define coverage gaps resulted in similar odds ratios (> 14-day gap = 11.8, > 60-day gap = 16.8). Cash assistance receipt and maternal knowledge of differences between Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and Medicaid eligibility criteria demonstrated strong protective effects against child Medicaid disenrollment. CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid disenrollment remains a significant policy problem and maternal Medicaid retention patterns show strong effects on child Medicaid retention. Policymakers need to invest in effective outreach strategies, including family-friendly application processes, to reduce enrollment barriers so that all eligible families can take advantage of these coverage opportunities.",Maternal and child patterns of Medicaid retention: a prospective cohort study.
"AIM: To calculate conditional power in comparative two-period studies with previously observed baseline data. METHOD: Isolate the variability attributable to the yet-to-observed data and modify the standard power formulae. RESULTS: For illustration, we examine rates of opioid overdose before and after a reformulation of one opioid product. The null hypothesis posited no impact of the reformulation, alternative hypotheses posited possible impacts, and ancillary hypotheses posited different secular pre-post changes directly observable in comparators. Conditional power varied with the size of the comparator population and with the assumed pre-post change for the comparator. CONCLUSION: Pre-post designs can be initiated after the baseline period is over. Power calculations that are conditioned on observed baseline data account differently for variability in the baseline and follow-up periods.",Conditional power for assessing population interventions.
"BACKGROUND/AIMS: To compare racial/ethnic proportions of subjects receiving growth hormone (GH) treatment to the expected proportions, and secondarily, to assess racial/ethnic differences in subject characteristics at GH treatment initiation. METHODS: Race/ethnicity-based expected frequencies of height <-2.25 SD were determined by applying relative risks for short stature, calculated from a regional population of 189,280 pediatric primary care patients, to US census data, and compared to racial/ethnic proportions of US subjects enrolled in the Pfizer International Growth Study (KIGS) using the chi2 test. Characteristics of white and black subjects at GH treatment initiation were presented as medians and compared by the Wilcoxon rank sum test (significant p < 0.01). RESULTS: White subjects exceeded the expected frequency (63%) for all indications (83%) and each separately, ranging from 73% for congenital GH deficiency (GHD) to 85% for idiopathic short stature (p < 0.001). Compared to white subjects, black subjects treated for idiopathic GHD had greater height deficits relative both to the population (-2.97 vs. -2.56 SD) and to their mid-parental heights (-2.47 vs. -1.89 SD), lower stimulated GH peak levels (4.9 vs. 6.0 ng/mL), and lower birth weights (-0.86 vs. -0.48 SD). Black subjects with congenital GHD had lower stimulated GH peaks (2.1 vs. 3.2 ng/mL) and started GH treatment at younger ages (2.9 vs. 4.8 years), while those with acquired GHD had lower birth weights (-1.12 vs. -0.08 SD). Male predominance did not differ by race for any or all indications. CONCLUSION: Overrepresentation of white children among those receiving GH treatment in the US KIGS registry reflects racial/ethnic treatment biases, not just differences in growth rates.",Racial/Ethnic Disparities in US Pediatric Growth Hormone Treatment.
"A 2-day workshop organized by the National Institutes of Health and U.S. Department of Agriculture included 16 presentations focused on the role of diet in alterations of the gastrointestinal microbiome, primarily that of the colon. Although thousands of research projects have been funded by U.S. federal agencies to study the intestinal microbiome of humans and a variety of animal models, only a minority addresses dietary effects, and a small subset is described in sufficient detail to allow reproduction of a study. Whereas there are standards being developed for many aspects of microbiome studies, such as sample collection, nucleic acid extraction, data handling, etc., none has been proposed for the dietary component; thus this workshop focused on the latter specific point. It is important to foster rigor in design and reproducibility of published studies to maintain high quality and enable designs that can be compared in systematic reviews. Speakers addressed the influence of the structure of the fermentable carbohydrate on the microbiota and the variables to consider in design of studies using animals, in vitro models, and human subjects. For all types of studies, strengths and weaknesses of various designs were highlighted, and for human studies, comparisons between controlled feeding and observational designs were discussed. Because of the lack of published, best-diet formulations for specific research questions, the main recommendation is to describe dietary ingredients and treatments in as much detail as possible to allow reproduction by other scientists.",Considerations for best practices in studies of fiber or other dietary components and the intestinal microbiome.
"Suboptimal compliance with child restraint system (CRS) recommendations can increase risk for injury or death in a motor vehicle crash. The purpose of this study was to examine scenarios associated with incomplete CRS use and non-use in children ages 4(-)10 years. We used a cross-sectional online survey with a convenience sample of parent/caregivers from the United States, age >/=18 years, with a child age 4(-)10 years in their home, who could read and spoke English, and drove child >/=6 times in previous three months. We used descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U to describe and compare the distribution of responses to situational use of CRSs among car seat users and booster seat users. We also used descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U to describe and compare the distribution of responses to carpooling items among booster seat users and non-booster seat users. There were significant differences among those who reported most often using booster seats (n = 282) and car seats (n = 127) in situations involving rental cars, driving just around the corner, car too crowded to fit the CRS, not enough CRSs in the vehicle, the CRS is missing from the car, or the child is in someone else's car without a CRS (p < 0.05). Among those who reported most often using booster seats and who carpooled other children (n = 159), 71.7% (n = 114) always used a booster seat for their own child. When carpooling other children, booster seat users were significantly more likely to use booster seats for other children ages 4(-)10 than the non-booster seat users (p < 0.01). Continued education and programs surrounding CRS use is critical, particularly for children who should be in booster seats.",Situational Use of Child Restraint Systems and Carpooling Behaviors in Parents and Caregivers.
"The field of red cell biology is undergoing a quiet revolution. Long assumed to be inert oxygen carriers, RBCs are emerging as important modulators of the innate immune response. Erythrocytes bind and scavenge chemokines, nucleic acids, and pathogens in circulation. Depending on the conditions of the microenvironment, erythrocytes may either promote immune activation or maintain immune quiescence. We examine erythrocyte immune function through a comparative and evolutionary lens, as this framework may offer perspective into newly recognized roles of human RBCs. Next, we review the known immune roles of human RBCs and discuss their activity in the context of sepsis where erythrocyte function may prove important to disease pathogenesis. Given the limited success of immunomodulatory therapies in treating inflammatory diseases, we propose that the immunologic function of RBCs provides an understudied and potentially rich area of research that may yield novel insights into mechanisms of immune regulation.",The Evolving Erythrocyte: Red Blood Cells as Modulators of Innate Immunity.
"Background: Few have examined nutrition literacy (i.e., capacity to process and make informed nutritional decisions) in behavioral weight loss. Nutrition literacy (NL) may impact necessary skills for weight loss, contributing to outcome disparities. Purpose: The study sets out to identify correlates of NL; evaluate whether NL predicted weight loss, food record completion and quality, and session attendance; and investigate whether the relations of race and education to weight loss were mediated by NL and self-monitoring. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of 6-month behavioral weight loss program in which overweight/obese adults (N = 320) completed a baseline measure of NL (i.e., Newest Vital Sign). Participants self-monitored caloric intake via food records. Results: NL was lower for black participants (p < .001) and participants with less education (p = .002). Better NL predicted better 6-month weight loss (b = -.63, p = .04) and food record quality (r = .37, p < .001), but not food record completion or attendance (ps > 0.05). Black participants had lower NL, which was associated with poorer food record quality, which adversely affected weight loss. There was no indirect effect of education on weight loss through NL and food record quality. Conclusions: Overall, results suggest that lower NL is problematic for weight loss. For black participants, NL may indirectly impact weight loss through quality of self-monitoring. This might be one explanation for poorer behavioral weight loss outcomes among black participants. Additional research should investigate whether addressing these skills through enhanced treatment improves outcomes.

"Women living with HIV (WLWH) suffer from poor viral suppression and retention postpartum. The effect of perinatal depression on care continuum outcomes during pregnancy and postpartum is unknown. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using HIV surveillance data of pregnant WLWH enrolled in perinatal case management in Philadelphia and evaluated the association between possible or definite depression with four outcomes: viral suppression at delivery, care engagement within three months postpartum, retention and viral suppression at one-year postpartum. Out of 337 deliveries (2005-2013) from 281 WLWH, 53.1% (n = 179) had no depression; 46.9% had either definite (n = 126) or possible (n = 32) depression during pregnancy. There were no differences by depression status across all four HIV care continuum outcomes in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. The prevalence of possible or definite depression was high among pregnant WLWH. HIV care continuum outcomes did not differ by depression status, likely because of supportive services and intensive case management provided to women with possible or definite depression.",HIV care continuum outcomes of pregnant women living with HIV with and without depression.
"Concerns regarding protein and amino acid deficiencies with plant-based proteins have precluded their use in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Many of these concerns were debunked years ago, but recommendations persist regarding the use of ""high-biological value"" (animal-based) proteins in CKD patients, which may contribute to worsening of other parameters such as blood pressure, metabolic acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia. Plant-based proteins are sufficient in meeting both quantity and quality requirements. Those eating primarily plant-based diets have been observed to consume approximately 1.0 g/kg/day of protein, or more. CKD patients have been seen to consume 0.7-0.9 g/kg/day of mostly plant-based protein without any negative effects. Furthermore, those substituting animal-based proteins for plant-based proteins have shown reductions in severity of hypertension, hyperphosphatemia, and metabolic acidosis. Plant-based proteins, when consumed in a varied diet, are not only nutritionally adequate but have pleiotropic effects which may favor their use in CKD patients.",Adequacy of Plant-Based Proteins in Chronic Kidney Disease.
"Cognitive impairments and negative symptoms in schizophrenia are associated with poorer outcomes and are typically resistant to pharmacological interventions. However, these features can vary dramatically in their level of expression, and they can improve as a function of external context (by providing performance-contingent incentives and a more stimulating environment) and internal context (by challenging defeatist performance beliefs and by reducing stress and improving physical health). This Open Forum briefly reviews some of this evidence for the situational variability of cognitive impairments and negative symptoms in schizophrenia and highlights psychosocial treatments that capitalize on this variability. The authors' goals are to stimulate development and implementation of interventions and to show practitioners how they can achieve more positive outcomes in their clinical work with what is often seen as a hard-to-treat population.",Treatment Implications of Situational Variability in Cognitive and Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia.
"OBJECTIVES: Vascular resistance is known to be one of the determinants of pulsatile flow. This study aimed to investigate whether quantitative 2-dimensional Doppler ultrasound can capture and evaluate the pulsatility within the placental bed vasculature. METHODS: The placental bed vasculature was imaged by directional power Doppler ultrasound. Ten-second cine clips were recorded by using standardized machine settings. A region of interest with a prominent Doppler signal in the uteroplacental interface was analyzed for the percentage of vascularity to generate a time-vascularity waveform. A vascular pulsatility index representing variation over the cardiac cycle was calculated by the ratio of the systolic-diastolic difference in vascularity to the mean vascularity. The acquisitions were repeated with 6 different pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) and 3 wall motion filter (WMF) settings to evaluate their impact on the Doppler measurements. RESULTS: Ten sets of cine clips were analyzed for this study. The pulsatile nature of the vascularity was readily apparent in each cine clip. The measured time-vascularity waveforms showed uniform cyclic variation in vascularity over the cardiac cycle, with systolic vascularity significantly higher than diastolic vascularity at each combination of PRF and WMF (P < .05). A gradual increase in the vascular pulsatility index was observed with an increasing PRF or WMF. Normalization of systolic-to-diastolic measurement provided a stable vascular assessment across the range of PRFs. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler cine clips provide a dynamic representation of the placental bed vasculature and a novel analytic approach to quantitatively evaluating the pulsatility of this critical vascular network. Further work is warranted to explore the reproducibility and clinical potential of this approach.",Placental Pulsatility: Quantitative Assessment of Placental Bed Vasculature by 2-Dimensional Doppler Cine Imaging.
"Quality indicators for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) were recently published due to a lack of consensus regarding delivery of care to adults with congenital heart disease (CHD). The objective of this study was to examine adherence to quality indicators for the care of patients with tetralogy of Fallot. Adults with tetralogy of Fallot seen in outpatient cardiology clinics at a tertiary care facility between July 2014 and June 2015 were included, and electronic medical records for each visit were reviewed. Completion rates for eight proposed quality indicator metrics were recorded and results for ACHD and non-ACHD cardiologists were compared. A total of 96 eligible patients completed 179 cardiology visits (134 ACHD and 45 non-ACHD). The quality indicator completion rates were over 80% for 7 of the 8 indicators. Metric 5 (cardiac magnetic resonance imaging every five years) had the lowest completion rate at 38.7%. Compared to non-ACHD cardiologists, ACHD cardiologists had higher completion rates for QRS assessment (88.1% vs. 75.6%, p = 0.04), echocardiogram by CHD expert (97.8% vs. 80.0%, p < 0.001), and infective endocarditis counseling (95.9% vs. 77.4%, p = 0.001). In this single center study, there was a wide range of quality indicator completion rates for tetralogy of Fallot. Routine cardiac MRI by an expert in CHD was identified as an area for improvement. There were significant differences in quality indicator completion between ACHD and non-ACHD cardiologists.",Quality Indicator Completion Rates for Adults with Tetralogy of Fallot.
"Reference managers, also known as citation managers, were designed to create bibliographic citations but have evolved into powerful tools for education. In addition to their core competency of easily managing in-text citations and automatically generating a list of works cited, modern reference managers can help researchers manage increasingly large libraries of portable document format (PDF) files, web pages and other documents. Users can annotate, store, organize, tag and search PDFs. These programs fetch useful associated metadata such as publication information, author lists and article abstracts. Additionally, the programs create a searchable index that can include the article abstract and often the complete text of many articles' PDFs. Modern reference managers allow for rapid creation, organization and classification of a curated collection of reference articles that can be made available anywhere, including on mobile devices. In this article the author describes how pediatric radiologists can use reference managers to facilitate learning, teaching and writing.","Learning, teaching and writing with reference managers."
"OBJECTIVE: Boot camps are being developed and implemented by a growing number of medical schools to facilitate medical students' transition to internship. However, there is limited conceptual understanding of how this facilitation occurs. METHODS: We developed and piloted a 1-week pediatric boot camp in 2015, then significantly revised and evaluated the program in 2016-2017 using a conceptual framework of self-efficacy. Consistent with this framework, the revised boot camp focuses on enhancing practical skills that can ease medical students' transition to internship. Observations and course evaluations informed process evaluation, whereas learner assessments immediately after and at 6 months after the boot camp informed outcomes evaluation in terms of both perceived self-efficacy and confidence. RESULTS: Medical students valued sessions that were ""hands on,"" and program improvements were made to include a variety of interactive curricular activities. Data from course evaluations provided evidence of increased perceived self-efficacy. Learner assessment showed a medium to large effect size for confidence in nearly all specific skills that were queried and a positive, albeit attenuated, effect on perceived self-efficacy at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Program evaluation of a pediatric boot camp informed by a conceptual framework of self-efficacy shed light on how it might facilitate medical students' transition to internship. A similar conceptual framework may be useful for other trainee preparatory courses.",A Pediatric Preintern Boot Camp: Program Development and Evaluation Informed by a Conceptual Framework.

"AIM: To determine clinical manifestations, imaging findings and outcome of patients with thrombosed developmental venous anomalies (DVAs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radiology database was searched retrospectively for thrombosed DVAs between 01/01/2000 to 07/01/2016. Demographic variables, associated risk factors, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, treatments, and follow-up were recorded. RESULTS: Six patients were found (four female and two male; age range 16-45 years with mean age, 21.3 years). The most common clinical presentation was headaches followed by neurological deficits and seizures. Venous infarction, parenchymal haemorrhage, venous congestive oedema were noted as the radiological findings. Clinical outcome was favourable in all patients with complete recovery or persistence of mild neurological symptoms. CONCLUSION: Thrombosed DVAs may occur under rare circumstances, which lead to variable symptoms. Familiarity with this entity and early recognition of associated findings including venous infarction, parenchymal haemorrhage, and venous congestive oedema would help early diagnosis and prompt treatment.",Clinical manifestations and imaging findings of thrombosis of developmental venous anomalies.
"Objectives: Pain control after shoulder arthroscopy can be challenging, often relying on opioids. The study aims to measure the quality of recovery (QoR) before and after implementation of a ""Multimodal Perioperative Pain Protocol"" (MP3) in patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder arthroscopy. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Free-standing ambulatory surgery facility of a tertiary care academic center. Subjects: Patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder arthroscopy. Methods: The primary end point of the study was the QoR-9 score at 24 hours, 48 hours, and one week after surgery. Secondary end points included 1) measuring the quality of pain management using the Revised American Pain Society Patient Oriented Questionnaire (APS-POQ-R) and 2) postoperative opioid requirements. Results: Data from132 patients in the control group (pre-intervention) and 120 patients in the MP3 group were analyzed. The QoR-9 scores were significantly higher for the MP3 group at all time points, but only met the minimal clinical important difference threshold at 24 hours (13.4 vs 14.9, P < 0.05) and 48 hours (14.0 vs 15.0, P < 0.05) postoperatively. Patients reported better quality of pain management after implementation of the MP3 in the domains of pain intensity, pain interference with activity, and sleep, and they reported the presence of negative emotions up to two days after ambulatory shoulder surgery. In addition, this protocol significantly reduced opioid consumption up to three days after surgery. Conclusions: Implementation of the MP3 improved the overall QoR and many aspects of postoperative pain relief while reducing total opioid consumption in patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder surgery.",Improved Quality of Recovery from Ambulatory Shoulder Surgery After Implementation of a Multimodal Perioperative Pain Management Protocol.
"Context: Anemia and thyroid dysfunction often co-occur, and both increase with age. Human data on relationships between thyroid disease and anemia are scarce. Objective: To investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between clinical thyroid status and anemia. Design: Individual participant data meta-analysis. Setting: Sixteen cohorts participating in the Thyroid Studies Collaboration (n = 42,162). Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure was anemia (hemoglobin <130 g/L in men and <120 g/L in women). Results: Cross-sectionally, participants with abnormal thyroid status had an increased risk of having anemia compared with euthyroid participants [overt hypothyroidism, pooled OR 1.84 (95% CI 1.35 to 2.50), subclinical hypothyroidism 1.21 (1.02 to 1.43), subclinical hyperthyroidism 1.27 (1.03 to 1.57), and overt hyperthyroidism 1.69 (1.00 to 2.87)]. Hemoglobin levels were lower in all groups compared with participants with euthyroidism. In the longitudinal analyses (n = 25,466 from 14 cohorts), the pooled hazard ratio for the risk of development of anemia was 1.38 (95% CI 0.86 to 2.20) for overt hypothyroidism, 1.18 (1.00 to 1.38) for subclinical hypothyroidism, 1.15 (0.94 to 1.42) for subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 1.47 (0.91 to 2.38) for overt hyperthyroidism. Sensitivity analyses excluding thyroid medication or high levels of C-reactive protein yielded similar results. No differences in mean annual change in hemoglobin levels were observed between the thyroid hormone status groups. Conclusion: Higher odds of having anemia were observed in participants with both hypothyroid function and hyperthyroid function. In addition, reduced thyroid function at baseline showed a trend of increased risk of developing anemia during follow-up. It remains to be assessed in a randomized controlled trial whether treatment is effective in reducing anemia.",The Relation Between Thyroid Function and Anemia: A Pooled Analysis of Individual Participant Data.

"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: With the advent of antiretroviral therapy and the resultant decrease in mortality among adults living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there is now an increased incidence of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities in these patients. Bariatric surgery is becoming an increasingly common treatment option for patients who are classified as clinically obese. There are limited data regarding the use of antiretroviral therapy in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the available literature regarding antiretroviral therapy and pharmaceutical properties in this special population. METHODS: Literature review was performed through PubMed, utilizing search terms of bariatric surgery, sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y, HIV infection, obesity and antiretroviral. Direct medical information requests to antiretroviral pharmaceutical manufacturers were also completed. RESULTS: Several case series and case reports have been published which demonstrate minimal risk of complications and maintenance of virologic suppression in the vast majority of patients. Bariatric surgery appears to be an effective mechanism for assistance in controlling obesity in patients infected with HIV; however, numerous factors may impact the safe and effective use of antiretroviral therapy. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Due to the physiologic changes and postoperative management following bariatric surgery, evaluation of the patients' medication regimens must be considered and several factors should be taken into account when choosing the appropriate antiretroviral regimen for these patients. Furthermore, communication between the patients' surgeon, HIV provider and a clinical pharmacist should occur prior to surgery to ensure the patient is optimized to achieve the best outcome including maintaining virologic suppression.",Antiretroviral considerations in HIV-infected patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

"There is increasing evidence that HIV is an independent risk factor for stroke, resulting in an emerging population of people living with both HIV and stroke all over the world. However, neurorehabilitation strategies for the HIV-stroke population are distinctly lacking, which poses an enormous global health challenge. In order to address this gap, a better understanding of the HIV-stroke population is needed, as well as potential approaches to design effective neurorehabilitation strategies for this population. This review goes into the mechanisms, manifestations, and treatment options of neurologic injury in stroke and HIV, the additional challenges posed by the HIV-stroke population, and rehabilitation engineering approaches for both high and low resource areas. The aim of this review is to connect the underlying neurologic properties in both HIV and stroke to rehabilitation engineering. It reviews what is currently known about the association between HIV and stroke and gaps in current treatment strategies for the HIV-stroke population. We highlight relevant current areas of research that can help advance neurorehabilitation strategies specifically for the HIV-stroke population. We then explore how robot-assisted rehabilitation combined with community-based rehabilitation could be used as a potential approach to meet the challenges posed by the HIV-stroke population. We include some of our own work exploring a community-based robotic rehabilitation exercise system. The most relevant strategies will be ones that not only take into account the individual status of the patient but also the cultural and economic considerations of their respective environment.",Designing robot-assisted neurorehabilitation strategies for people with both HIV and stroke.

Clustering scRNA-seq is essential in identifying new cell types and studying their characteristics. We develop CellBIC (single Cell BImodal Clustering) to cluster scRNA-seq data based on modality in the gene expression distribution. Compared with classical bottom-up approaches that rely on a distance metric, CellBIC performs hierarchical clustering in a top-down manner. CellBIC outperformed the bottom-up hierarchical clustering approach and other recently developed clustering algorithms while maintaining the hierarchical structure of cells. Importantly, CellBIC identifies type 2 diabetes and age specific beta cell signatures characterized by SIX3 and CDH2, respectively.",CellBIC: bimodality-based top-down clustering of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveals hierarchical structure of the cell type.

"Objective: To review current evidence and experience with anesthesia and airway management issues in children and young adults with arthrogryposis. Data sources: Review of existing world literature and description of personal experience at a center for children's orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation over 2 decades. Methods: Description of common problems and their solutions in this unusual and diverse group of patients. Results: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenital includes more than 400 conditions that lead to congenital joint contractures affecting more than one body area. Among the many causes of arthrogryposis, 50%-65% fall into two large categories - amyoplasia and distal arthrogryposis. There is general agreement that best function in children with arthrogryposis is achieved through early mobilization of joint contractures. Children with arthrogryposis average >5 operative procedures during childhood. Anesthesia for these procedures may be complicated by limited jaw mobility and mouth opening, restricted lung development, positioning difficulties, difficult venous access and concerns about increased risk for malignant hyperthermia. 75% of arthrogryposis patients do not have a difficult airway. For those with a history of airway problems or those meeting criteria for a difficult airway, careful advanced planning helps to assure safe and successful surgery. We describe several specialized techniques for endotracheal intubation of children with arthrogryposis. Conclusions: Children and young adults with arthrogryposis are a diverse group. Many pose unique challenges for airway and surgical management. Review of individual anesthesia records and careful advanced planning by a coordinated, experienced airway team can lead to best outcomes from arthrogryposis surgery.",Difficult airway management in children and young adults with arthrogryposis.
"The diagnosis of ADHD among teens and young adults has been associated with a higher likelihood of motor vehicle crashes. Some studies suggest a beneficial effect of ADHD medication but the exact efficacy is still being debated. Further, medication adherence, which is low in this age group, can further reduce effectiveness. Our long-term objective is to reduce unsafe driving among drivers with ADHD by detecting medication non-adherence through driver behavior modeling and monitoring. As a first step, we developed the described lab study protocol to obtain reliable driver behavior data that will then be used to design and train behavior models built through machine learning. This experimental study protocol was developed to systematically compare driving behaviors under two medication conditions (before and after intake of medication) among young adults with ADHD and a control group of non-ADHD. A driving simulator was used to examine driving behaviors and interactions with traffic. The primary outcome was speed management for two comparisons (ADHD vs. non-ADHD and before vs. after medication), and secondary objectives involved understanding differences among the participants utilizing self-reported surveys about ADHD symptoms, drivers' knowledge, and perception about safety. The study protocol was designed to maximize participant safety and efficiency of data collection, as multiple measures were collected over two 2-h study visits. The sampled ADHD drivers were demographically and psychosocially similar but clinically different from the non-ADHD group. Overall, this protocol was effective in participant recruitment and retention, allowed staggered data collection, and can be incorporated in a subsequent clinical trial that examines the efficacy of a machine-learning based driver monitoring intervention.",Design of an experimental protocol to examine medication non-adherence among young drivers diagnosed with ADHD: A driving simulator study.

"PURPOSE: This paper presents new quantitative data on a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) study, distortion study, and targeting accuracy phantom study for our patient-mounted robot (called Arthrobot). Arthrobot was developed as an MRI-guided needle placement device for diagnostic and interventional procedures such as arthrography. METHODS: We present the robot design and inverse kinematics. Quantitative assessment results for SNR and distortion study are also reported. A respiratory motion study was conducted to evaluate the shoulder mounting method. A phantom study was conducted to investigate end-to-end targeting accuracy. Combined error considering targeting accuracy, respiratory motion, and structure deformation is also reported. RESULTS: The SNR study showed that the SNR changes only 2% when the unpowered robot was placed on top of a standard water phantom. The distortion study showed that the maximum distortion from the ground truth was 2.57%. The average error associated with respiratory motion was 1.32 mm with standard deviation of 1.38 mm. Results of gel phantom targeting studies indicate average needle placement error of 1.64 mm, with a standard deviation of 0.90 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Noise and distortion of the MR images were not significant, and image quality in the presence of the robot was satisfactory for MRI-guided targeting. Combined average total error, adding mounting stability errors and structure deformation errors to targeting error, is estimated to be 3.4 mm with a standard deviation of 1.65 mm. In clinical practice, needle placement accuracy under 5 mm is considered sufficient for successful joint injection during shoulder arthrography. Therefore, for the intended clinical procedure, these results indicate that Arthrobot has sufficient positioning accuracy.",Development of a shoulder-mounted robot for MRI-guided needle placement: phantom study.
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effects of an online, hour-long migraine education and management education program on health outcomes in people with migraine experiencing significant depressive symptoms. METHODS: Eligible individuals in the community with comorbid migraine and depressive symptoms (n=95) participated in the 12-week study. Participants completed self-report questionnaires examining general functioning, headache-specific disability, migraine frequency, pain, and depressive symptoms, before, and at 2, 6, and 12weeks following the migraine education and management program. Primary analyses evaluated change over time in each outcome, using individual linear growth curve models. RESULTS: After watching the migraine education and management video, there were significant effects of time (across all time points) for average pain level in the past 30days (b=-0.20, p<.001), most intense pain level in the past 30days (b=-0.33, p<.001) depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8; b=-0.28, p=.002), and headache-specific disability (Headache Disability Inventory; b=-1.32, p<.001), such that each of these outcomes improved linearly over time.

"Several theories describing the decision-making process in the intensive care unit (ICU) have been formulated. However, none of them appreciate the complexities of the process in an eclectic way by unifying several miscellaneous variables in 1 comprehensive theory. The purpose of this review is to highlight the key intricacies associated with the decision-making process in the ICU, to describe the theoretical frameworks with a special emphasis on gaps of knowledge, and to offer some avenues for improvement. The application of theoretical framework helps us to understand and to modify the structure of the process. Expected utility theory, regret theory, prospect theory, fuzzy-trace theory, construal level theory, and quantum probability theory were formulated over the years to appreciate an increased complexity of the decision-making process in the ICU. However the decision makers engage, these models may affect patient care because each of these frameworks has several benefits and downsides. There are gaps of knowledge in understanding how physicians match the different theoretical frameworks of the decision-making process with the potentially high ICU variability and load, especially when the ""best outcome"" is often nondiscrete and multidimensional. Furthermore, it is unclear when the preferential application of reflexive, habitual, variable, and biased-prone processes results in patient and staff detriment. We suggest better matching of theoretical frameworks with strengths of the human decision-making process and balanced application computer aids, artificial intelligence, and organizational modifications. The key component of this integration is work to increase the self-awareness of decision-making processes among residents, fellows, and attending physicians.",Narrative Review of Decision-Making Processes in Critical Care.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Traditional management of pediatric urolithiasis has been associated with a significant amount of radiation exposure. The steady increase in pediatric urolithiasis in recent years has raised concerns of long-term consequences in this special population. This review seeks to highlight the newer insights towards eliminating radiation exposure in pediatric urolithiasis from contemporary literature. RECENT FINDINGS: Establishing a clinical care pathway restricting usage of computed tomography in emergency rooms in suspected pediatric urolithiasis can eliminate unnecessary radiation exposure. Ultrasound can successfully replace fluoroscopy at ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Accredited technicians who use optimized settings combined with dose monitoring can significantly reduce fluoroscopic radiation. Radiation exposure in pediatric urolithiasis can be significantly reduced and potentially eliminated by employing standard protocols during workup, intervention, and follow-ups. Larger studies can support the feasibility of routinely performing ultrasound-guided surgeries instead of fluoroscopy. There is a need for development of consensus towards standardization of the management of pediatric urolithiasis.",Approaches to Eliminate Radiation Exposure in the Management of Pediatric Urolithiasis.

"Patients with complex, multisutural, and syndromic craniosynostosis frequently exhibit intracranial hypertension. The intracranial hypertension cannot be entirely attributed to craniocephalic disproportion with calvarial restriction as cranial vault expansion does not consistently alleviate elevated intracranial pressure. Evidence most strongly supports a multifactorial interaction, including venous hypertension along with other pathogenic processes. Patients with craniosynostosis exhibit marked venous anomalies, including stenosis of the jugular/sigmoid complex and transverse sinuses, as well as extensive transosseous venous collaterals. These abnormal intracranial-extracranial occipital venous collaterals may represent anomalous development, with persistence and subsequent enlargement of channels normally present in the fetus, either as a primary defect or as non-regression in response to failure of development of the jugular/sigmoid complexes. It has been suggested by some authors that venous hypertension in patients with craniosynostosis may be treated directly via jugular foraminoplasty, venous stenting, or jugular venous bypass, though these options are not in common clinical practice. Obstructive sleep apnea, occurring as a consequence of midface hypoplasia, may also contribute to intracranial hypertension in syndromic craniosynostosis patients. Thus, correction of facial deformities, as well as posterior fossa decompression, may also play important roles in treatment of intracranial hypertension. Determining the precise mechanistic underpinnings underlying intracranial hypertension in any given patient with craniosynostosis requires individualized workup and management.",Intracranial venous hypertension in craniosynostosis: mechanistic underpinnings and therapeutic implications.
"BACKGROUND: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have social and communication deficits that impair their involvement in family life. No measures of child involvement in the family have been validated for the ASD population. AIM: To evaluate the validity of a measure of Family Involvement (FI) of children ages 5-12 with ASD. METHOD: Parents of children ages 5-12 with ASD (n = 114) completed FI items from the PROMIS(R) pediatric Family Relationships item bank in computerized adaptive testing (CAT) format, as well as measures of ASD symptom burden, parenting stress, and parental depression. Medical record review provided child intelligence or developmental quotient. A reference sample (n = 236) closely matching the ASD sample in age and gender was created from the national standardization sample, and underwent a simulated CAT. RESULTS: The CAT precisely and efficiently measured parent-reported FI of children with ASD. Average FI scores were lower among children with ASD (M = 46.3, SD = 7.1) than children in the reference sample (M = 52.5, SD = 9.1). A ""dose response"" decrease in FI was observed as ASD severity increased. Increased parenting stress was associated with lower FI. No relationship between FI and child IQ was found. CONCLUSION: The FI items captured FI among children ages 5-12 with ASD with acceptable precision. Reduced FI among children with ASD, particularly those with higher symptom severity, suggests validity of the items in this population.",Measuring the involvement in family life of children with autism spectrum disorder: A DBPNet study.
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the scrotum represents a useful supplemental imaging technique in the characterization of scrotal masses, particularly recommended in cases of nondiagnostic ultrasonographic findings. An accurate characterization of the benign nature of scrotal masses, including both intratesticular and paratesticular ones may improve patient management and decrease the number of unnecessary radical surgical procedures. Alternative treatment strategies, including follow-up, lesion biopsy, tumor enucleation, or organ sparing surgery may be recommended. The aim of this pictorial review is to present how MRI helps in the characterization of sonographically indeterminate scrotal masses and to emphasize the key MRI features of benign scrotal masses.",Sonographically indeterminate scrotal masses: how MRI helps in characterization.
"OBJECTIVES: We assessed the adherence to neuroimaging guidelines and the diagnostically relevant yield of neuroimaging in newly presenting early life epilepsy (ELE). METHODS: There were 775 children with a new diagnosis of epilepsy (<3 years old at onset) who were recruited through the ELE study at 17 US pediatric epilepsy centers (2012-2015) and managed prospectively for 1 year. The data were analyzed to assess the proportion of children who underwent neuroimaging, the type of neuroimaging, and abnormalities. RESULTS: Of 725 children (93.5%) with neuroimaging, 714 had an MRI (87% with seizure protocols) and 11 had computed tomography or ultrasound only. Etiologically relevant abnormalities were present in 290 individuals (40%) and included: an acquired injury in 97 (13.4%), malformations of cortical development in 56 (7.7%), and other diffuse disorders of brain development in 51 (7.0%). Neuroimaging was abnormal in 160 of 262 (61%) children with abnormal development at diagnosis versus 113 of 463 (24%) children with typical development. Neuroimaging abnormalities were most common in association with focal seizure semiology (40%), spasms (47%), or unclear semiology (42%). In children without spasms or focal semiology with typical development, 29 of 185 (16%) had imaging abnormalities. Pathogenic genetic variants were identified in 53 of 121 (44%) children with abnormal neuroimaging in whom genetic testing was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Structural abnormalities occur commonly in ELE, and adherence to neuroimaging guidelines is high at US pediatric epilepsy centers. These data support the universal adoption of imaging guidelines because the yield is substantially high, even in the lowest risk group.",Neuroimaging of Early Life Epilepsy.

"Social stress causes profound urinary bladder dysfunction in children that often continues into adulthood. We previously discovered that the intensity and duration of social stress influences whether bladder dysfunction presents as overactivity or underactivity. The transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel is integral in causing stress-induced bladder overactivity by increasing bladder sensory outflow, but little is known about the development of stress-induced bladder underactivity. We sought to determine if TRPV1 channels are involved in bladder underactivity caused by stress. Voiding function, sensory nerve activity, and bladder wall remodeling were assessed in C57BL/6 and TRPV1 knockout mice exposed to intensified social stress using conscious cystometry, ex vivo afferent nerve recordings, and histology. Intensified social stress increased void volume, intermicturition interval, bladder volume, and bladder wall collagen content in C57BL/6 mice, indicative of bladder wall remodeling and underactive bladder. However, afferent nerve activity was unchanged and unaffected by the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine. Interestingly, all indices of bladder function were unchanged in TRPV1 knockout mice in response to social stress, even though corticotrophin-releasing hormone expression in Barrington's Nucleus still increased. These results suggest that TRPV1 channels in the periphery are a linchpin in the development of stress-induced bladder dysfunction, both with regard to increased sensory outflow that leads to overactive bladder and bladder wall decompensation that leads to underactive bladder. TRPV1 channels represent an intriguing target to prevent the development of stress-induced bladder dysfunction in children.",Development of stress-induced bladder insufficiency requires functional TRPV1 channels.

STUDY DESIGN: Two educational programs pairing online videos with FCs were developed and peer-reviewed. These programs were piloted at five institutions. Fellows completed surveys, and fellows and educators participated in focus groups after their FC experiences. RESULTS: Thirty-five fellows responded to the survey. Forty-one fellows and six educators participated in focus groups. Fellows and educators preferred online videos paired with FCs over didactic teaching and perceived them to be effective for knowledge acquisition and application. CONCLUSION: Fellows and educators preferred FC learning over traditional didactics and reported that FCs facilitated creation of a learning community, fostering active learning. The favorable response toward this pilot project and the feasibility of its use supports further development of a standardized NPM physiology curriculum for fellowship training.",Flipping the classroom: a national pilot curriculum for physiology in neonatal-perinatal medicine.
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the transcription profile of the mouse nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus with an unbiased method. Furthermore, pathophysiological relevance of selected genes was demonstrated in the mouse tail intervertebral disc injury model. DESIGN: Paired normal mouse nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus tissue from C57BL/6j mice was examined by a polymerase chain reaction array. Key gene expression in the normal and injured intervertebral discs was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among the 84 genes studied, 63 were expressed higher in annulus fibrosus than in nucleus pulposus; only four genes were expressed higher in nucleus pulposus than in annulus fibrosus (n = 4, P </= 0.05). Real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed that cadherin (cdh) 2 gene expression was higher in nucleus pulposus than in annulus fibrosus, and type I collagen (col1) gene expression was higher in the annulus fibrosus than in nucleus pulposus (n = 8, P < 0.01). One week after tail intervertebral disc injury, cdh2 gene expression decreased, while col1 expression increased (n = 8, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to examine the relative expression of 84 genes in normal mouse nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus. Key genes in the normal and injured mouse intervertebral discs were confirmed with real-time polymerase chain reaction. This information should be useful for studying the mouse model of intervertebral disc degeneration and guide future cell therapy approaches.",Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Molecule Gene Expression in the Normal and Injured Murine Intervertebral Disc.
"Transposable elements modify human genome by inserting into new loci or by mediating homology-, microhomology-, or homeology-driven DNA recombination or repair, resulting in genomic structural variation. Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) is a rare lethal neonatal developmental lung disorder caused by point mutations or copy-number variant (CNV) deletions of FOXF1 or its distant tissue-specific enhancer. Eighty-five percent of 45 ACDMPV-causative CNV deletions, of which junctions have been sequenced, had at least one of their two breakpoints located in a retrotransposon, with more than half of them being Alu elements. We describe a novel approximately 35 kb-large genomic instability hotspot at 16q24.1, involving two evolutionarily young LINE-1 (L1) elements, L1PA2 and L1PA3, flanking AluY, two AluSx, AluSx1, and AluJr elements. The occurrence of L1s at this location coincided with the branching out of the Homo-Pan-Gorilla clade, and was preceded by the insertion of AluSx, AluSx1, and AluJr. Our data show that, in addition to mediating recurrent CNVs, L1 and Alu retrotransposons can predispose the human genome to formation of variably sized CNVs, both of clinical and evolutionary relevance. Nonetheless, epigenetic or other genomic features of this locus might also contribute to its increased instability.",LINE- and Alu-containing genomic instability hotspot at 16q24.1 associated with recurrent and nonrecurrent CNV deletions causative for ACDMPV.

": media-1vid110.1542/5799875103001PEDS-VA_2017-3616Video Abstract OBJECTIVES: Noncigarette tobacco products may confer a risk of marijuana use similar to combustible cigarettes. We examined whether adolescent electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), hookah, or combustible cigarette use is associated with initiating and currently using marijuana as well as using both tobacco and marijuana concurrently. METHODS: Adolescents from 10 public schools in Los Angeles, California, completed in-classroom surveys at baseline (fall 2013, ninth grade) and at a 24-month follow-up (fall 2015, 11th grade). Among adolescents who never used marijuana at baseline (N = 2668), associations of baseline e-cigarette, hookah, or combustible cigarette use with ever marijuana use (initiation), current marijuana use (past 30 days), and current dual use of marijuana and these tobacco products at the 24-month follow-up were examined. RESULTS: Baseline ever versus never e-cigarette use was associated with initiation (odds ratio [OR] 3.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.69-4.90) and current (OR 3.67; 95% CI 2.51-5.36) marijuana use 24 months later. Ever versus never hookah use was associated with initiation (OR 3.55; 95% CI 2.49-5.08) and current (OR 4.10; 95% CI 2.69-6.25) marijuana use 24 months later. Similar associations were observed for combustible cigarette smoking and initiation (OR 4.30; 95% CI 2.79-6.63) and current use of marijuana (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.05-3.68). Current use of any of these tobacco products at baseline was associated with current use of both tobacco and marijuana (OR 2.28; 95% CI 1.47-3.55) 24 months later. CONCLUSIONS: The association between tobacco use and subsequent marijuana use across adolescence extends to multiple tobacco products.","Adolescent E-Cigarette, Hookah, and Conventional Cigarette Use and Subsequent Marijuana Use."
"OBJECTIVES: To propose a model describing levels of integration of palliative care into the care of ICU patients. DATA SOURCES: Literature review and author opinion. CONCLUSIONS: All critical care team members should demonstrate and foster their core competencies in caring for patients with complex illness and uncertain prognosis, including at the end of life. We describe these core competencies of the ICU team member as ""primary"" palliative care skills. Some ICU team members will have special expertise in end-of-life care or symptom management and decision-making support and will serve as local experts within the ICU team as a resource to other team members. We call this skillset ""secondary"" palliative care. Some patients will benefit from the full range of expertise provided by a separate consulting team, with additional training, focused on caring for patients with palliative care needs across the full spectrum of patient locations within a health system. We term the skillset provided by such outside consultants ""tertiary"" palliative care. Solutions for meeting patients' palliative care needs will be unique within each system and individual institution, depending on available resources, history, and structures in place. Providers from multiple professions will usually contribute to meeting patient needs.",Integrating Palliative Care Into the ICU: From Core Competency to Consultative Expertise.

"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate contemporary clinical outcomes and identify triggers for arrhythmias or sudden death in an international cohort of Timothy Syndrome (TS) patients including those with novel TS-associated CACNA1C mutations. BACKGROUND: TS is an extremely rare genetic disorder of the L-type cardiac channel Cav1.2 encoded by CACNA1C. The syndrome is characterized by multisystem abnormalities consisting of QT prolongation, congenital heart defects, syndactyly, facial dysmorphism, and neurological symptoms. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with TS between January 1, 1994, and April 1, 2016, from 12 international tertiary care pediatric centers were included in this retrospective study. Data were gathered via survey from the patients' electrophysiologists. RESULTS: Seventeen patients diagnosed with TS were identified. Length of follow-up was 4.9 years (range 3.0 to 19.0 years). Mean QTc was 640 ms (range 500 to 976 ms). All patients were treated with beta-blockers; 13 patients (76%) were also treated with an implantable defibrillator. Eleven patients experienced an episode of aborted cardiac arrest, 6 associated with general anesthesia and 2 with hypoglycemia. Four patients died suddenly due to ventricular fibrillation, 2 of whom had associated hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that mortality in TS patients is due to multifactorial mechanisms, which include ventricular arrhythmias, pulseless electrical activity, and hypoglycemia. A simple nomenclature for ongoing studies of TS and related syndromes is described. A worldwide prospective registry is needed for continued exploration of this syndrome.",Clinical Outcomes and Modes of Death in Timothy Syndrome: A Multicenter International Study of a Rare Disorder.
"Ferumoxytol is a nanoparticle formulation approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for systemic use to treat iron deficiency. Here, we show that, in addition, ferumoxytol disrupts intractable oral biofilms and prevents tooth decay (dental caries) via intrinsic peroxidase-like activity. Ferumoxytol binds within the biofilm ultrastructure and generates free radicals from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), causing in situ bacterial death via cell membrane disruption and extracellular polymeric substances matrix degradation. In combination with low concentrations of H2O2, ferumoxytol inhibits biofilm accumulation on natural teeth in a human-derived ex vivo biofilm model, and prevents acid damage of the mineralized tissue. Topical oral treatment with ferumoxytol and H2O2 suppresses the development of dental caries in vivo, preventing the onset of severe tooth decay (cavities) in a rodent model of the disease. Microbiome and histological analyses show no adverse effects on oral microbiota diversity, and gingival and mucosal tissues. Our results reveal a new biomedical application for ferumoxytol as topical treatment of a prevalent and costly biofilm-induced oral disease.",Topical ferumoxytol nanoparticles disrupt biofilms and prevent tooth decay in vivo via intrinsic catalytic activity.

"Effective pain and symptom management is a crucial part of the care of those with life-threatening illnesses and their family members. Nurses in all settings have a vital role in providing this essential care. A recent summit held on May 12, 2017, ""Nurses Leading Change and Transforming Palliative Care,"" convened by the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association and attended by leaders of 26 nursing organizations strongly endorsed the importance of nursing's role in pain and symptom management and developed an agenda to advance these efforts. The agreed-upon goals of pain and symptom treatment include care that is effective (as defined by the patient), efficient (delivered in a timely manner), and safe (reduced risk of respiratory depression, prevention and early management of adverse effects, as well as attention to methods to prevent diversion such as safe storage and disposal). Through an iterative process, desired patient outcomes and nursing actions were outlined to support effective pain and symptom management in primary palliative care. These recommendations were categorized as education, clinical care, research, and regulatory concerns.

"PURPOSE: Changes in drug absorption and first-pass metabolism have been reported throughout the pediatric age range. Our aim is to characterize both intestinal and hepatic CYP3A-mediated metabolism of midazolam in children in order to predict first-pass and systemic metabolism of CYP3A substrates. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic (PK) data of midazolam and 1-OH-midazolam from 264 post-operative children 1-18 years of age after oral administration were analyzed using a physiological population PK modelling approach. In the model, consisting of physiological compartments representing the gastro-intestinal tract and liver,intrinsic intestinal and hepatic clearances were estimated to derive values for bioavailability and plasma clearance. RESULTS: The whole-organ intrinsic clearance in the gut wall and liver were found to increase with body weight, with a 105 (95% confidence interval (CI): 5-405) times lower intrinsic gut wall clearance than the intrinsic hepatic clearance (i.e. 5.08 L/h (relative standard error (RSE) 10%) versus 527 L/h (RSE 7%) for a 16 kg individual, respectively). When expressed per gram of organ, intrinsic clearance increases with increasing body weight in the gut wall, but decreases in the liver, indicating that CYP3A-mediated intrinsic clearance and local bioavailability in the gut wall and liver do not change with age in parallel. The resulting total bioavailability was found to be age-independent with a median of 20.8% in children (95%CI: 3.8-50.0%). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the intrinsic CYP3A-mediated gut wall clearance is substantially lower than the intrinsic hepatic CYP3A-mediated clearance in children from 1 to 18 years of age, and contributes less to the overall first-pass metabolism compared to adults.",Characterization of Intestinal and Hepatic CYP3A-Mediated Metabolism of Midazolam in Children Using a Physiological Population Pharmacokinetic Modelling Approach.
"BACKGROUND: Upper extremity transplantation is a quality-of-life enhancing treatment for select patients with upper extremity loss. This article reviews the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative challenges in the upper extremity transplantation process and the lessons learned from the first 2 decades of hand transplantation. METHODS: Key components of the author's hand transplantation protocol including patient selection, donor screening, surgical rehearsal, donor procurement, transplantation, immunosuppression, and patient outcome reporting/follow-up are reported to assist other teams who wish to establish a hand transplantation program. RESULTS: There have been many advancements in the first 20 years of hand transplantation including better patient selection criteria, the recent addition of pediatric patients, improved surgical techniques such as the use of virtual surgical planning, and improved immunosuppression protocols. Improvement has also taken place in the tracking and reporting of hand transplant outcomes, but more work is clearly needed to fully define the benefits of transplantation, especially for pediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 20 years, significant progress has been made in upper extremity transplantation although a number of challenges remain including how to best document and share outcome measures, optimize immunosuppression, and diagnose/treat rejection. The authors encourage upper extremity transplant programs to report their experience and protocols to advance hand transplantation as standard of care for properly selected individuals.",Building a Hand and Upper Extremity Transplantation Program: Lessons Learned From the First 20 Years of Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation.
"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and with excess costs. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are the most common HCAIs in neonates and children. AIM: To establish national benchmark data for rates of CLABSI in neonatal and paediatric intensive care units (NICUs and PICUs) and paediatric oncology units (ONCs). METHODS: Active surveillance for CLABSI was conducted from June 2016 to February 2017. A collaborative of 14 NICUs, four PICUs, and six ONCs participated in the programme. Surveillance definitions of central line (CL), central line utilization (CLU) ratio, CLABSI event, and CLABSI rate were based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2014 National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. Medical records were assessed daily for calculating CL-days, patient-days, and susceptibility of isolated organisms. FINDINGS: A total of 111 CLABSI episodes were recorded. The overall mean CLABSI rate was 4.41 infections per 1000 CL-days, and the CLU ratio was 0.31. CLABSI rates were 6.02 in NICUs, 6.09 in PICUs, and 2.78 per 1000 CL-days in ONCs. A total of 123 pathogens were isolated. The most common pathogens were Enterobacteriaceae (36%), followed by Gram-positive cocci (29%), non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria (16%), and fungi (16%). Overall, 37% of Gram-negative pathogens were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 37% to carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Nationally representative CLABSI rates were determined for paediatric patients. These data could be used to benchmark and serve as baseline data for the design and evaluation of infection control and antimicrobial stewardship interventions.",Establishing nationally representative central line-associated bloodstream infection surveillance data for paediatric patients in Greece.
"Metabolomics refers to top-down systems biological analysis of metabolites in biological specimens. Phenotypic proximity of metabolites makes them interesting candidates for studying biomarkers of environmental stressors such as parasitic infections. Moreover, the host-parasite interaction directly impinges upon metabolic pathways since the parasite uses the host metabolite pool as a biosynthetic resource. Malarial infection, although not recognized as a classic metabolic disorder, often leads to severe metabolic changes such as hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Thus, metabolomic analysis of the infection has become an invaluable tool for promoting a better understanding of the host-parasite interaction and for the development of novel therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge obtained from metabolomic studies of malarial infection in rodent models and human patients. Metabolomic analysis of experimental rodent malaria has provided significant insights into the mechanisms of disease progression including utilization of host resources by the parasite, sexual dimorphism in metabolic phenotypes, and cellular changes in host metabolism. Moreover, these studies also provide proof of concept for prediction of cerebral malaria. On the other hand, metabolite analysis of patient biofluids generates extensive data that could be of use in identifying biomarkers of infection severity and in monitoring disease progression. Through the use of metabolomic datasets one hopes to assess crucial infection-specific issues such as clinical severity, drug resistance, therapeutic targets, and biomarkers. Also discussed are nascent or newly emerging areas of metabolomics such as pre-erythrocytic stages of the infection and the host immune response. This review is organized in four broad sections-methodologies for metabolomic analysis, rodent infection models, studies of human clinical specimens, and potential of immunometabolomics. Data summarized in this review should serve as a springboard for novel hypothesis testing and lead to a better understanding of malarial infection and parasite biology.",Metabolomic changes in vertebrate host during malaria disease progression.

"BACKGROUND: Neonatal jaundice affects at least 481,000 newborns every year. Phototherapy is recommended but it's effects are limited and adverse reactions can occur. In China, phototherapy combined with Yinzhihuang oral liquid is also used for this condition. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness and safety of combination therapy with Yinzhihuang oral liquid and phototherapy compared to phototherapy alone for treating neonatal jaundice. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was performed in four Chinese databases, two English language databases and two trial registries from inception to June 2017. Two authors independently screened the citations and retrieved full publications for randomized trials on Yinzhihuang oral liquid combined with phototherapy for neonatal jaundice. The methodological quality of the trials was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. Data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3. RESULT: Totally 17 trials (involving 2561 neonates) were included in this review. Fourteen of them had a high risk of bias. Significant differences were detected between combination therapy and phototherapy alone for serum bilirubin level (MD - 50.25 mumol/L, 95% CI -64.01 to - 36.50, I(2) = 98%; 7 trials, post-hoc decision choosing random effects model), failure of jaundice resolution (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.32, I(2) = 0%; 11 trials, fixed effects model), and time to jaundice resolution (MD - 2.17 days, 95%CI -2.96 to - 1.38, I(2) = 98%; 6 trials, random effects model). Adverse events were reported in eight trials but none were serious. Trial sequential analysis for serum bilirubin level suggested that the cumulative Z-curve (which represents 1478 participants) reached the required information size (DARIS = 1301 participants). CONCLUSION: Based on trials with low methodological quality, Yinzhihuang oral liquid combined with phototherapy seemed to be safe and superior to phototherapy alone for reducing serum bilirubin in neonatal jaundice. These potential benefits need to be confirmed in future trials using rigorous methodology.

"Bloom Syndrome (BSyn) is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes growth deficiency, endocrine abnormalities, photosensitive skin rash, immune abnormalities, and predisposition to early-onset cancer. The available treatments for BSyn are symptomatic, and early identification of complications has the potential to improve outcomes. To accomplish this, standardized recommendations for health supervision are needed for early diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this report is to use information from the BSyn Registry, published literature, and expertise from clinicians and researchers with experience in BSyn to develop recommendations for diagnosis, screening, and treatment of the clinical manifestations in people with BSyn. These health supervision recommendations can be incorporated into the routine clinical care of people with BSyn and can be revised as more knowledge is gained regarding their clinical utility.",Health supervision for people with Bloom syndrome.
"OBJECTIVE: Efforts to decrease hospital revisits often focus on improving access to outpatient follow-up. Our objective was to assess the relationship between perceived access to timely office-based care and subsequent 30-day revisits following hospital discharge for 4 common respiratory illnesses. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of children 2 weeks to 16 years admitted to 5 US children's hospitals for asthma, bronchiolitis, croup, or pneumonia between July 2014 and June 2016. Hospital and emergency department (ED) (in the case of croup) admission surveys administered to caregivers included the Consumer Assessments of Healthcare Providers and Systems Timely Access to Care. Access composite scores (range 0-100, with greater scores indicating better access) were linked with 30-day ED revisits and inpatient readmissions from the Pediatric Health Information System. The relationship between access to timely care and repeat utilization was assessed using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for demographics, hospitalization, and home/outpatient factors. RESULTS: Of the 2438 children enrolled, 2179 (89%) reported an office visit in the previous 6 months. Average access composite score was 52.0 (standard deviation, 36.3). In adjusted analyses, greater access scores were associated with greater odds of 30-day ED revisits (odds ratio [OR]=1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.13)-particularly for croup (OR=1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.36)-but not inpatient readmissions (OR=1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: Perceived access to timely office-based care was associated with significantly greater odds of subsequent ED revisit. Focusing solely on enhancing timely access to care following discharge for common respiratory illnesses may be insufficient to prevent repeat utilization.",Perceived Access to Outpatient Care and Hospital Reutilization Following Acute Respiratory Illnesses.
"Reproductive health is a key component of cancer care and survivorship, encompassing gynecologic issues ranging from contraception and fertility to treatment of sexual dysfunction and menopause. Yet, oncology providers are often unfamiliar with the management of gynecologic issues. In order to address the unmet needs of female cancer patients, reproductive health should be addressed at the time of cancer diagnosis and continue through survivorship. Universal screening for pregnancy intention can guide counseling on contraception and fertility preservation. Safe and efficacious contraceptive options for both patients undergoing active treatment and cancer survivors are available and can often offer non-contraceptive benefits such as regulation of menses. Prompt referral to reproductive endocrinology specialists allows patients to explore options for fertility preservation prior to the receipt of cancer-directed therapies. Due to a rapid drop in hormone levels, treatment-induced menopause often results in severe symptoms. In patients with induced menopause, balancing the risks of hormone therapy compared to the decreased quality of life and health concerns associated with early menopause may help patients with difficult decisions regarding symptom control. Cancer treatment impacts sexual function with both physical changes to the vulvovaginal tissues and altered relationship dynamics. Open discussions on the impact to sexual health are paramount to quality of life after cancer. While more data is needed in many areas, proactive management of reproductive health issues is crucial to quality of life in cancer survivorship. In this article, we review contemporary management of the reproductive health of the female cancer patient.",Reproductive health care across the lifecourse of the female cancer patient.
"The use of radiotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer has evolved from treatments utilizing large fields with hand placed blocks to radiotherapy treatments given with a linear accelerator moving around the patient on a robotic arm. These technologic developments have allowed radiation dose escalations resulting in improvements in disease and patient reported outcomes with longer biochemical disease-free survival (DFS) as well as improved quality of life. Increased costs have accompanied these technologic improvements with some private payers questioning the increased cost of the newer treatments and in some instances refusing to pay for some treatment modalities such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or proton beam therapy (PBT). Cost-effectiveness analysis have been used in an attempt to illustrate these new treatments were cost-effective when compared to the older treatments. Cost-effectiveness analyses will need to be adapted in the current health care environment to provide an assessment of value as many payers, including medicare, move to a value-based reimbursement system.",Cost effectiveness of prostate cancer radiotherapy.

"Background: Emergence of population pharmacokinetic models for prediction of individual pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles facilitates individualization of prescribed prophylactic therapy for patients with hemophilia A and B and may have a favorable impact on clinical outcomes and annual factor utilization. How providers approach the integration and application of these data into routine clinical practice is not clear. Objective: To explore the potential application of and barriers to incorporating PK profiles into current hemophilia prophylaxis decision making. Methods: A facilitated group discussion of hematologists practicing within the federally-supported United States Hemophilia Treatment Center Network was conducted. Separately, a group of parents of patients with severe hemophilia less than 18 years of age participated in a focus group on individualizing prophylactic factor regimens with the use of PK data. Results: Physician participants constructed a conceptual model for factors that determined their selection of hemophilia prophylaxis. These factors clustered in five groupings. When charged with creating a prophylaxis regimen for a specific clinical case including PK data, eight of nine providers generated a unique regimen. Parent focus group supported PK data use as they preferred data driven treatment decisions. Conclusions: Clinician application of PK data for prophylaxis decision making is heterogeneous. Prospective evaluation of the use of PK-tailored prophylaxis in routine care and its impact on patient outcomes is needed. Parents perceived that, while obtaining blood draws could be challenging, images of factor activity decay informed their decisions about physical activity timing and provided an opportunity for partnership and shared decision making with their provider.",Focusing in on use of pharmacokinetic profiles in routine hemophilia care.
"Objective: To determine the disease relevance of a novel de novo dominant variant in the SLC25A4 gene, encoding the muscle mitochondrial adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) carrier, identified in a child presenting with a previously unreported phenotype of mild childhood-onset myopathy. Methods: Immunohistochemical and western blot analysis of the patient's muscle tissue were used to assay for the evidence of mitochondrial myopathy and for complex I-V protein levels. To determine the effect of a putative pathogenic p.Lys33Gln variant on ADP/ATP transport, the mutant protein was expressed in Lactococcus lactis and its transport activity was assessed with fused membrane vesicles. Results: Our data demonstrate that the heterozygous c.97A>T (p.Lys33Gln) SLC25A4 variant is associated with classic muscle biopsy findings of mitochondrial myopathy (cytochrome c oxidase [COX]-deficient and ragged blue fibers), significantly impaired ADP/ATP transport in Lactococcus lactis and decreased complex I, III, and IV protein levels in patient's skeletal muscle. Nonetheless, the expression levels of the total ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) content in the muscle biopsy was largely unaffected. Conclusions: This report further expands the clinical phenotype of de novo dominant SLC25A4 mutations to a childhood-onset, mild skeletal myopathy, without evidence of previously reported clinical features associated with SLC25A4-associated disease, such as cardiomyopathy, encephalopathy or ophthalmoplegia. The most likely reason for the milder disease phenotype is that the overall AAC expression levels were not affected, meaning that expression of the wild-type allele and other isoforms may in part have compensated for the impaired mutant variant.",Expanding the phenotype of de novo SLC25A4-linked mitochondrial disease to include mild myopathy.
"Background: Internal medicine physicians are often the first providers to encounter patients with a new diagnosis of tuberculosis. Given the public health risks of missed tuberculosis cases, assessing internal medicine residents' ability to diagnose tuberculosis is important. Methods: Internal medicine resident knowledge and practice patterns in pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis at 7 academic hospitals were assessed utilizing (a) a 10-item validated pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis assessment tool and (b) a retrospective chart review of 343 patients who underwent a pulmonary tuberculosis evaluation while admitted to a resident-staffed internal medicine or infectious disease service. Our primary outcomes were the mean score and percentage of correct responses per assessment tool question, and the percentage of patients who had Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended tuberculosis diagnostic tests obtained. Results: Of the 886 residents who received the assessment, 541 responded, yielding a response rate of 61%. The mean score on the assessment tool (SD) was 4.4 (1.6), and the correct response rate was 57% (311/541) or less on 9 of 10 questions. On chart review, each recommended test was obtained for </=43% (148/343) of patients, other than chest x-ray (328/343; 96%). A nucleic acid amplification test was obtained for 18% (62/343) of patients, whereas 24% (83/343) had only 1 respiratory sample obtained. Twenty patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis. Conclusions: Significant knowledge and practice gaps exist in internal medicine residents' abilities to diagnose tuberculosis. As residents represent the future providers who will be evaluating patients with possible tuberculosis, such deficiencies must be addressed.",Internal Medicine Residents' Knowledge and Practice of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Diagnosis.

"A previous GWAS study performed on Brazilian pooled samples indicated some SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) differentially frequent in infertile patients with endometriosis and controls. Some of them were located in the genes whose biological function suggests that they could be associated with endometriosis pathogenesis; thus, the purpose here was to confirm GWAS findings in a larger group of cases and controls in order to associate the results with the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Then, a genetic association study comprising 394 infertile women with endometriosis and 650 fertile control women was conducted. TaqMan allelic discrimination assays were used to investigate the frequency of three SNPs in the genes KAZN (rs10928050), LAMA5 (rs2427284), and TAC3 (rs733629). The analysis revealed a significant association of KAZN rs10928050 (p = .015) and LAMA5 rs2427284 (p = .0059) SNPs with endometriosis-related infertility, while TAC3 rs733629 showed no difference between cases and controls. As a conclusion, it was possible to observe that individual genotyping of a larger sample of patients and controls confirmed the association among KAZN and LAMA5 with endometriosis-related infertility and revealed new candidate genes contributing to the condition.",New candidate genes associated to endometriosis.
"BACKGROUND: Restenosis remains a problem in hemodialysis access interventions. Paclitaxel-coated balloons have shown promise in reducing access-related restenosis in small trials. The primary hypotheses for our multicenter trial were superior effectiveness at 180 days and noninferior safety at 30 days of a drug-coated balloon compared with conventional angioplasty for treatment of dysfunctional arteriovenous fistulas. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This randomized trial enrolled 285 patients with dysfunctional arteriovenous fistulas at 23 centers. Grafts, central venous stenoses, thrombosed fistulas, and immature fistulas were excluded. All patients received angioplasty of the lesion responsible for access dysfunction. After successful angioplasty (</=30% residual stenosis), lesions were treated with either a paclitaxel-coated balloon or an uncoated control balloon of similar design to the drug-coated balloon. Access function during follow-up was determined per centers' usual protocols; reintervention was clinically driven. The primary efficacy outcome assessment was done at 6 months, and the safety assessment was done within 30 days of the procedure. Prespecified secondary end points included assessment of postintervention target lesion primary patency and access circuit primary patency at 6 months. RESULTS: The 180-day end point was not met with target lesion primary patency (71%+/-4% for the drug-coated balloon and 63%+/-4% for control; P=0.06), representing a difference of 8%+/-6% (95% confidence interval, -3% to 20%). Access circuit primary patency did not differ between groups. Interventions to maintain target lesion patency were fewer for the drug-coated balloon at 6 months (0.31 versus 0.44 per patient; P=0.03). The primary safety noninferiority end point was met and did not differ between groups (P=0.002).

"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease, which is characterized by the development of noncaseating granulomas amid healthy tissue. While most commonly affecting the mediastinum and/or lungs, sarcoid can also affect the liver, resulting in ""hepatic sarcoid."" The spectrum of disease in hepatic sarcoid is variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild liver enzyme abnormalities to end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation. Because clinically-significant hepatic sarcoid is rare, research on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment is limited. The mainstays of hepatic sarcoid treatment have involved steroids and more recently, ursodeoxycholic acid; however, novel immunomodulatory agents provide new possibilities for management. Questions remain regarding screening, diagnostic modalities, and what to treat with and when. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available research on the epidemiology, clinical course, and management of hepatic sarcoid, and identify gaps in our knowledge to motivate future research.",A Comprehensive Review of Hepatic Sarcoid.

"The number of women entering medical school and careers in science is increasing; however, women remain the minority of those in senior faculty and leadership positions. Barriers contributing to the shortage of women in academics and academic leadership are numerous, including a shortage of role models and mentors. Thus, achieving equity in a timelier manner will require more than encouraging women to pursue these fields of study or waiting long enough for those in the pipelines to be promoted. Social media provides new ways to connect and augments traditional forms of communication. These alternative avenues may allow women in academic medicine to obtain the support they are otherwise lacking. In this perspective, we reflect on the role of Twitter as a supplemental method for navigating the networks of academic medicine. The discussion includes the use of Twitter to obtain (1) access to role models, (2) peer-to-peer interactions, and continuous education, and (3) connections with those entering the pipeline-students, trainees, and mentees. This perspective also offers suggestions for developing a Twitter network. By participating in the ""Twittersphere,"" women in academic medicine may enhance personal and academic relationships that will assist in closing the gender divide.",Expanding Opportunities for Professional Development: Utilization of Twitter by Early Career Women in Academic Medicine and Science.
"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Current guidelines do not recommend routine surveillance imaging as part of follow-up care for patients treated for locoregional endometrial carcinoma. This study seeks to determine the potential benefit of routine surveillance imaging by evaluating outcomes of patients whose recurrences were detected on routine surveillance compared to those whose recurrences were identified after presenting with symptoms. MATERIALS/METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who developed recurrence after surgical treatment, with or without adjuvant therapy, for locoregional endometrial carcinoma. A total of 149 patients were identified with adequate clinical information regarding the recurrence. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate overall survival and progression-free survival. RESULTS: The median age of patients at diagnosis was 69.2 years (range, 38.0-99.5 years). Initial stages included stage I, 49.7%; stage II, 10.1%; stage III, 38.3%; and stage IV, 1.3%. Histologic diagnoses included endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 48.3%; and other diagnoses (including papillary serous carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma), 51.7%. Patients were initially treated with a variety of therapies: surgery alone in 20.8%, surgery and radiation in 25.5%, surgery and chemotherapy in 12.1%, and trimodality therapy in 41.6%. Sites of recurrence included 20.8% vaginal, 14.8% pelvic and 64.4% distant sites. Recurrences were detected asymptomatically in 86 patients (57.7%) and symptomatically in 63 patients (42.3%). Of those detected asymptomatically, 80.2% were detected by imaging. Overall, when comparing symptomatic versus asymptomatic recurrences, there was no difference in overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.83; P = 0.29) or progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.70; P = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who develop asymptomatic recurrences of their endometrial carcinoma do not seem to have a better prognosis than those who present with symptomatic recurrences. Thus, these results do not support routine imaging surveillance for patients treated for locoregional endometrial carcinoma. Further prospective evaluation is needed.",Use of Aggressive Surveillance for Locoregional Endometrial Cancer After Local Therapy.
"Taste receptors were named for their originally-identified expression on the tongue and role in the sensation of taste (gustation). They are now known to be involved in many chemosensory processes outside the tongue. Expression of the receptors for bitter, sweet, and umami was recently identified in many organs, including the brain, airway, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive systems. We do not yet know the full roles of these receptors in all of these tissues, nor do we know all of the endogenous ligands that activate them. However, taste receptors are emerging as potentially important therapeutic targets. Moreover, they may mediate some off target effects of drugs, as many medications in common clinical use are known to be bitter. The focus of this review is on recent basic and clinical data describing the expression of bitter (T2R) and sweet (T1R) receptors in the airway and their activation by secreted bacterial compounds. These receptors play important roles in innate immune nitric oxide production and antimicrobial peptide secretion, and may be useful targets for stimulating immune responses in the upper respiratory tract via topical therapies. Moreover, genetic variation in these receptors may play a role in the differential susceptibility of patients to certain types of respiratory infections as well as to differential outcomes in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). CRS is a syndrome of chronic upper respiratory infection and inflammation and has a significant detrimental impact on patient quality of life. CRS treatment accounts for approximately 20% of adult antibiotic prescriptions and is thus a large driver of the public health crisis of antibiotic resistance. Taste receptors represent a novel class of therapeutic target to potentially stimulate endogenous immune responses and treat CRS patients without conventional antibiotics.",Taste receptors in the upper airway.
"Context: Anti-Mullerian hormone based (AMH) age at menopause predictions remain cumbersome due to predictive inaccuracy. Objective: To perform an Individual Patient Data (IPD) meta-analysis, regarding AMH based menopause prediction. Data sources: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases. Study selection: Prospective cohort studies regarding menopause prediction using serum AMH levels were selected by consensus discussion. Data selection: Individual cases were included if experiencing a regular cycle at baseline. Exclusion criteria were hormone use and gynecological surgery. Data synthesis: 2596 women were included, 1077 experienced menopause. A multivariable Cox regression analysis assessed time to menopause (TTM) using age and AMH. AMH predicted TTM, however, added value on top of age was poor (age alone C-statistic 84%; age + AMH HR 0.66 95% CI 0.61-0.71, C-statistic 86%). Moreover, the capacity of AMH to predict early (</=45 years) and late menopause (>/=55 years) was assessed. An added effect of AMH was demonstrated for early menopause (age alone C-statistic 52%; age + AMH HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.24-0.45, C-statistic 80%). A Weibull regression model calculating individual age at menopause revealed that predictive inaccuracy remained present and increased with decreasing age at menopause. Lastly, a check of non-proportionality of the predictive effect of AMH demonstrated a reduced predictive effect with increasing age. Conclusion: AMH was a significant predictor of TTM and especially of time to early menopause. However, individual predictions of age at menopause demonstrated a limited precision, particularly when concerning early age at menopause, making clinical application troublesome.",Does AMH relate to timing of menopause?

"OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in unplanned 30-day all-condition hospital readmissions for children aged 1 to 17 years between 2009 and 2014. METHODS: Analysis was conducted with the 2009-14 Nationwide Readmissions Database from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Annual hospital readmission rates, resource use, and the most common reasons for readmission were calculated for the 2009-14 period. RESULTS: The rate of readmission for children aged 1 to 17 years was essentially stable between 2009 and 2014 (5.5% in 2009 and 5.9% in 2014). In 2009, the most common reason (principal diagnosis) for readmission was sickle cell anemia, whereas in 2014 the most common reason was epilepsy. Pneumonia fell from the second to the sixth most common reason for readmission over this period (from 3832 to 2418 stays). Other respiratory infections were among the top 10 principal readmission diagnoses in 2009, but not in 2014. Septicemia was among the 10 most common reasons for readmission in 2014, but not in 2009. Although the average cost of index (ie, initial) stays with a subsequent readmission were similar in 2009 and 2014, the average cost of index stays without a readmission and cost of readmission stays increased by approximately 23%. In both 2009 and 2014, the average cost of the index stays with a subsequent readmission was 73% to 89% higher than that of the index stays of children who were not readmitted within 30 days. The average cost of index stays preceding a readmission was 33% to 45% higher than average costs for readmitted stays. In 2014, the aggregate cost of index stays plus readmissions was $1.58 billion, with 42.9% of the costs attributable to readmissions. Regarding the average costs and lengths of stay for the 10 most common readmission diagnoses, in 2009 the average cost per stay for complications of devices, implants, or grafts was nearly 5 times greater than that of asthma ($21,200 vs $4500, respectively). In 2014, average cost per stay ranged from $5500 for asthma to $39,500 for septicemia. In 2009, the average length of stay (LOS) for complications of devices, implants, or grafts was more than 3 three times higher than that for asthma (7.8 days vs 2.5 days, respectively), and in 2014, the average LOS for septicemia was nearly 4 times higher than that for asthma (10.4 days vs. 2.6 days). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a baseline assessment for examining trends in 30-day unplanned pediatric readmissions, an important quality metric as the provisions of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act and the Affordable Care Act are changed and implemented in the future. More than 50,000 pediatric hospital stays in 2014 occurred within 30 days of a previous hospitalization, with an average cost of $13,800. This report is timely, as the health care system works to become more patient-centered and public and private payers grapple with how to pay for quality care for children. The report provides baseline information that can be used to further explore ways to reduce unplanned readmissions.","Annual Report on Health Care for Children and Youth in the United States: Focus on 30-Day Unplanned Inpatient Readmissions, 2009 to 2014."

"BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing has been widely applied to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders. The large body of data support the role of epigenetic mechanisms in neurological function of both human and animals. Yet, the existing data is limited by the fact that epigenetic and transcriptomic changes have only been measured in separate cohorts. This has limited precise correlation of epigenetic changes in gene expression. NEW METHOD: Single Sample Sequencing (S3EQ) is an innovative approach to analyze both epigenetic and transcriptomic regulation within a single neuronal sample. Using this method, we analyzed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- and RNA-sequencing data from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the same animal. RESULTS: ChIP-S3EQ of neuronal nuclei reliably identified hPTM enrichment in the adult mouse NAc with high precision. Comparing cellular compartments, we found that the spliceosome of whole cell RNA-seq was more closely recapitulated by cytosolic RNA-S3EQ than nuclear RNA-seq. Finally, S3EQ showed increased sensitivity for correlating chromatin modifications with gene expression, especially for lowly expressed transcripts. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: S3EQ accurately generates both RNA- and ChIP-seq from a single sample, providing a clear advantage over existing methods which require two samples. ChIP-S3EQ performance was comparable to ChIP-seq, while RNA-S3EQ generated an almost identical expression profile to nuclear-enriched and whole cell RNA-seq. Finally, we directly compared RNA-seq by cellular compartments, addressing a limitation of RNA-seq studies limited to neuronal nuclei. CONCLUSION: The S3EQ method can be applied to improve the correlative power of transcriptomic and epigenomic studies in neuronal tissue.",Single sample sequencing (S3EQ) of epigenome and transcriptome in nucleus accumbens.
"BACKGROUND: The optimal nutritional therapy in the field of pancreatic surgery is still debated. METHODS: An international panel of recognized pancreatic surgeons and pancreatologists decided that the topic of nutritional support was of importance in pancreatic surgery. Thus, they reviewed the best contemporary literature and worked to develop a position paper to provide evidence supporting the integration of appropriate nutritional support into the overall management of patients undergoing pancreatic resection. Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence were based on the approach of the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation Working Group. RESULTS: The measurement of nutritional status should be part of routine preoperative assessment because malnutrition is a recognized risk factor for surgery-related complications. In addition to patient's weight loss and body mass index, measurement of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity should be considered in the preoperative evaluation because they are strong predictors of poor short-term and long-term outcomes. The available data do not show any definitive nutritional advantages for one specific type of gastrointestinal reconstruction technique after pancreatoduodenectomy over the others. Postoperative early resumption of oral intake is safe and should be encouraged within enhanced recovery protocols, but in the case of severe postoperative complications or poor tolerance of oral food after the operation, supplementary artificial nutrition should be started at once. At present, there is not enough evidence to show the benefit of avoiding oral intake in clinically stable patients who are complicated by a clinically irrelevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (a so-called biochemical leak), while special caution should be given to feeding patients with clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula orally. When an artificial nutritional support is needed, enteral nutrition is preferred whenever possible over parenteral nutrition. After the operation, regardless of the type of pancreatic resection or technique of reconstruction, patients should be monitored carefully to assess for the presence of endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Although fecal elastase-1 is the most readily available clinical test for detection of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, its sensitivity and specificity are low. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy should be initiated routinely after pancreatoduodenectomy and in patients with locally advanced disease and continued for at least 6 months after surgery, because untreated pancreatic exocrine insufficiency may result in severe nutritional derangement. CONCLUSION: The importance of this position paper is the consensus reached on the topic. Concentrating on nutritional support and therapy is of utmost value in pancreatic surgery for both short- and long-term outcomes.",Nutritional support and therapy in pancreatic surgery: A position paper of the International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS).
"BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) causes 4% of all healthcare-associated infections in the USA. The process by which the local hospital milieu contributes to VRE acquisition is not fully understood. AIM: To determine the importance of specific factors within the local hospital environment for healthcare-associated VRE acquisition. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted to six intensive care units at an academic medical centre from January 2012 to December 2016 with negative rectal VRE cultures on admission. VRE acquisition was defined as a positive surveillance swab performed at any time after the initial negative swab during the index hospitalization. The exposures of interest were VRE colonization pressure, VRE importation pressure, and use of vancomycin. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modelling was performed, with patients followed until VRE acquisition, death, or for up to 30 days. FINDINGS: Of 8485 patients who were initially VRE negative, 161 patients acquired VRE. On univariate analysis, patients with VRE acquisition were more likely to have received vancomycin, to have had a neighbouring patient who received vancomycin, to have high VRE importation pressure, or to have high VRE colonization pressure. On multivariable analysis, only high VRE colonization pressure was an independent predictor of VRE acquisition (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.79; 95% confidence interval: 1.19-2.70). CONCLUSION: VRE colonization pressure was the most important risk factor for healthcare-associated VRE acquisition, regardless of VRE importation pressure. Interventions seeking to reduce VRE acquisition should focus on minimizing transmission between patients with known VRE and the local hospital environment.",The local hospital milieu and healthcare-associated vancomycin-resistant enterococcus acquisition.
"Purpose: Gap junctions provide a conduit between the intracellular fluids of the pigmented (PE) and non-pigmented (NPE) ciliary epithelial cells, and are therefore critical in the secretion of the aqueous humor (AH). However, opinions differ concerning the connexin (Cx) composition of the gap junctions. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the expression of Cx in the porcine ciliary epithelium (CE), a favorable model for humans; and determine the contribution of the highest expressed Cx to AH secretion. Methods: Freshly-harvested porcine CE cells were used. The mRNA and protein expressions of gap junctions were assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting (WB), respectively. The relative gene expressions of various Cx were determined by quantitative PCR. The gap junction permeability of isolated PE-NPE cell couplets was evaluated by Lucifer Yellow dye transfer. Results: Using RT-PCR and WB, Cx43, Cx45, Cx47, Cx50, and Cx60 were present in porcine CE, with Cx43 being the most abundant isoform, having over 200-fold higher expression than other Cx. Cx43 was primarily localized in the PE-NPE interface and the basolateral membranes of PE cells. Knockdown of Cx43 by siRNA significantly reduced gene and protein expressions, resulting in reduction of transcellular fluid flow by 90%. Conclusions: Cx43 was found to be the major component of gap junctions in porcine CE. Consistent with results from a bovine model, our results support the important role of Cx43 in mediating AH secretion. This finding may shed light on the development of a novel ocular hypotensive agent.",Characterization and Regulation of Gap Junctions in Porcine Ciliary Epithelium.

"Recovery of burn patients may be impeded by mental health problems. By gaining a better understanding of the impact that psychological factors may have on hospital length of stay, providers may be better informed to address the complex needs of burn survivors through effective and efficient practices. This systematic review summarizes existing data on the adverse psychological factors for the length of burn patients' hospitalization, and assesses the methodological quality of the extant literature on mental health conditions of burn survivors. A literature search was conducted in four electronic databases: PubMed, PsychINFO, Science Direct, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. Results yielded reports published between 1980 and 2016. Methodological quality was assessed by using an 11-item methodological quality score system. Seventy-four studies were identified by search; 19 articles were eligible for analysis. Findings demonstrate paucity of evidence in the area. Reports indicate longer hospital stay among burn patients with mental health problems. Substance use was the most consistent mental-health predictor of longer hospital stay. Heterogeneity in data on mental health conditions rendered impossible estimation of effect sizes of individual psychological factors on length of hospitalization. Many studies over-relied on retrospective designs, and crude indicators of psychological factors. Findings indicate that mental health problems do have an impact on the trajectory of burn recovery by increasing the length of hospital stay for burn survivors. Inpatient mental health services for burn patients are critically needed. Prospective designs, and more sensitive psychological indicators are needed for future studies.",Examining the Impact of Psychological Factors on Hospital Length of Stay for Burn Survivors: A Systematic Review.
"OBJECTIVES: Urgent medical evaluation is recommended for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and fever. Clear recommendations exist regarding certain aspects of treatment, but other areas lack evidence. We determined practice variation for children with SCD presenting with fever to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: Retrospective chart review of children ages 3 months to 21 years with SCD presenting to the ED with fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C in the ED or preceding 24 hours. Visits from 3 sickle cell centers were included. Outcomes included blood culture, complete blood count, antibiotic treatment, chest x-ray, urinalysis, electrolytes, and hospital disposition. Differences greater than 10% were considered clinically meaningful. RESULTS: The population included 14,454 visits, of which 4143 (29%) were febrile and met all inclusion criteria. A complete blood count and blood culture were obtained at 94% of visits, and antibiotics were given at 91%, with no differences among sites. Meaningful differences existed for disposition, with 52%, 43%, and 99% of patients admitted to the inpatient units at hospitals A, B, and C, respectively. Differences were seen in obtaining a urinalysis (33%, 17%, and 21%), electrolytes (2%, 50%, and 12%), and chest x-rays for patients 2 years and older (78%, 77%, 64%) for hospitals A, B, and C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation exists in the proportion of children who receive a urinalysis, electrolytes, chest x-ray, and, most importantly, admission to the hospital. These examples of practice variation represent potential opportunities to define best care practices for children with SCD presenting to the ED for fever.",Practice Variation in Emergency Department Management of Children With Sickle Cell Disease Who Present With Fever.
"Sexual minorities in the United States are at elevated risk of prejudice, discrimination, and violence victimization due to stigma associated with their sexual orientation. These stressors may contribute to physiological stress responses and changes in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). To date, no studies have examined the associations among minority sexual orientation, recent stressful events, and diurnal salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) patterns. The present study included 1663 young adults ages 18-32 years (31% men, 69% women) from the Growing Up Today Study, a prospective cohort of U.S. youth. Participants provided five saliva samples over the course of one day to estimate diurnal sAA patterns. Sexual orientation groups included completely heterosexual with no same-sex partners (CH; referent), mostly heterosexual/completely heterosexual with same-sex partners, and gay/lesbian/bisexual (LB or GB). Sex-stratified multilevel models were fit to evaluate the association of sexual orientation with diurnal patterns of log sAA. The association of recent stressful events was also evaluated. Among women, sexual minorities scored significantly higher than CH on perceived stress and number of stressful events in the past month (p<0.05). Among men, sexual minorities scored higher than CH on perceived stress but not recent stressful events. In multivariable models, recent stressful events were not associated with sAA patterns, but significant sexual orientation group differences in sAA diurnal rhythm were observed among women though not among men. Compared to CH women, LB showed a blunted awakening response and elevated sAA levels across the day, both indicators consistent with SNS dysregulation. Findings suggest dysregulation of stress physiology in LB women, but not other sexual minority women or men, relative to same-sex heterosexuals. Observed dysregulation may relate to exposure among LB women to chronic stressors associated with sexual orientation stigma, although these relations and differences by sex warrant further study.",Sexual orientation and salivary alpha-amylase diurnal rhythms in a cohort of U.S. young adults.
"Although infrequently associated with illness in humans, Salmonella enterica, subsp. enterica serovar Kentucky is the most common non-clinical, non-human serovar reported in the United States, being largely found in poultry and poultry products, as well as being associated with cattle. This serovar is polyphyletic and can be separated into two groups, Group I and II, based on CRISPR-typing analysis. In Salmonella Kentucky isolates from human clinical samples in Pennsylvania, both lineages are equally represented. The goal of this study was to determine whether both groups were also represented in domestic food animals in Pennsylvania. We analysed the CRISPR arrays from 67 Salmonella Kentucky isolates used PCR and sequencing of CRISPR arrays or analysis of whole genome sequences to analyse the CRISPR arrays and Across a collection of 67 Salmonella Kentucky isolates that includes those collected from farms, veterinary clinical samples as well as isolates from retail meats, we show that Group I Salmonella Kentucky are the exclusive lineage present.

"Introduction The ability to provide family-centered care (FCC) and the ability to work in interprofessional care teams (IPC) are essential educational outcomes in graduate training programs. Lack of standardized measures leave programs to rely on idiosyncratic methods to monitor outcomes. We developed a faculty observation tool as part of an effort to create a national quality improvement database. We present evidence for the feasibility and validity of the faculty observation tool. Methods Trainees and faculty at four independent training programs participated. Nineteen maternal and child health disciplines were represented. Faculty supervisors rated trainees using the new measure (I-FOR), and trainees completed related subscales of a previously developed self-report measure, the core competency measure (CCM). Faculty provided qualitative feedback regarding the I-FOR in a separate questionnaire. Results Faculty (n = 78) completed the I-FOR on 86 trainees (86/92 = 93%) and reported satisfaction with completing the measures. The I-FOR demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.930) and test-retest reliability (IPC r = 0.862, FCC r = 0.823, p < 0.001). Greater than 95% of participants reported that the I-FOR accurately addressed the relevant skills for each practice domain. The I-FOR showed no correlation with the CCM. Significant improvements over time in the I-FOR ratings were demonstrated in three out of four programs. Discussion The I-FOR demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Faculty responses provide evidence for the feasibility and validity of the instrument. Self-report and faculty-observation measures both increased with training but were not correlated with each other.",The Interprofessional/Family-Centered-Care Observation Rubric (I-FOR): Results of a Multicenter Study of a New Measure of Educational Outcomes.
"OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize the reasons manuscripts are rejected after peer review from the journal Headache. BACKGROUND: Numerous editorials, reviews, and research manuscripts have been published on the topic of manuscript rejection. However, few of these papers evaluate the reasons for rejection after peer review systematically. None are specific to the field of neurology or headache medicine. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all submissions to Headache from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016 was performed. Peer reviewer and editor comments for each manuscript were reviewed, and unlimited reasons for rejection were coded for each manuscript. Detailed reasons for rejection were then grouped into 9 broader categories. RESULTS: A total of 784 submissions were received from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016. Of those, 336 were immediately rejected and 434 went on to peer review. During this period, the overall rejection rate was 62.6% and the rejection rate after peer review was 35.7%. The 6 most common reasons for rejection after peer review were: flaws in methodology and study design, poor reporting of methodology, poor statistical analysis, overstatement of conclusions, problems with covariates or outcomes, and problems with the control or case group. CONCLUSION: Flaws in methodology and study design were the most common reasons for rejection after peer review from Headache between 2014-2016.",Reasons for Manuscript Rejection After Peer Review From the Journal Headache.
"The control of cell fate is an epigenetic process initiated by transcription factors (TFs) that recognize DNA motifs and recruit activator complexes and transcriptional machineries to chromatin. Lineage specificity is thought to be provided solely by TF-motif pairing, while the recruited activators are passive. Here, we show that INTS13, a subunit of the Integrator complex, operates as monocytic/macrophagic differentiation factor. Integrator is a general activator of transcription at coding genes and is required for eRNA maturation. Here, we show that INTS13 functions as an independent sub-module and targets enhancers through Early Growth Response (EGR1/2) TFs and their co-factor NAB2. INTS13 binds poised monocytic enhancers eliciting chromatin looping and activation. Independent depletion of INTS13, EGR1, or NAB2 impairs monocytic differentiation of cell lines and primary human progenitors. Our data demonstrate that Integrator is not functionally homogeneous and has TF-specific regulatory potential, revealing a new enhancer regulatory axis that controls myeloid differentiation.",Targeted Enhancer Activation by a Subunit of the Integrator Complex.
"BACKGROUND: In May 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force issued a grade D recommendation against PSA-based prostate cancer screening. Epidemiologists have concerns that an unintended consequence is a problematic increase in high-risk disease and subsequent prostate cancer-specific mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess the effect of decreased PSA screening on the presentation of high-risk prostate cancer post-radical prostatectomy (RP). Nine high-volume referral centers throughout the United States (n = 19,602) from October 2008 through September 2016 were assessed and absolute number of men presenting with GS >/= 8, seminal vesicle and lymph node invasion were compared with propensity score matching. RESULTS: Compared to the 4-year average pre-(Oct. 2008-Sept. 2012) versus post-(Oct. 2012-Sept. 2016) recommendation, a 22.6% reduction in surgical volume and increases in median PSA (5.1-5.8 ng/mL) and mean age (60.8-62.0 years) were observed. The proportion of low-grade GS 3 + 3 cancers decreased significantly (30.2-17.1%) while high-grade GS 8 + cancers increased (8.4-13.5%). There was a 24% increase in absolute numbers of GS 8+ cancers. One-year biochemical recurrence rose from 6.2 to 17.5%. To discern whether increases in high-risk disease were due to referral patterns, propensity score matching was performed. Forest plots of odds ratios adjusted for age and PSA showed significant increases in pathologic stage, grade, and lymph node involvement. CONCLUSIONS: All centers experienced consistent decreases of low-grade disease and absolute increases in intermediate and high-risk cancer. For any given age and PSA, propensity matching demonstrates more aggressive disease in the post-recommendation era.",Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening.
"A model of oxidative phosphorylation and its regulation is presented that is consistent with the experimental data on metabolism in higher plants and animals. The variables that provide real time control of metabolic status are: intramitochondrial [NAD(+)]/[NADH], energy state ([ATP]/[ADP][Pi]), and local oxygen concentration ([O2]). ATP consumption and respiratory chain enzyme content are tissue specific (liver vs heart muscle) and the latter is modulated by chronic alterations in ATP consumption (i.e. endurance training etc). ATP consumption affects the energy state, which increases or decreases as necessary to match synthesis with consumption. [NAD(+)]/[NADH], local [O2], and respiratory chain content determine the energy state at which match of synthesis and utilization is achieved. Tissues vary widely in their ranges of ATP consumption. Expressed as the turnover of cytochrome c, the rates may change little (7 to 12 sec(-1)) (liver) or a lot (1 to >300 sec(-1)) (flight muscle of birds, bats, and insects). Ancillary metabolic pathways, including creatine or arginine kinase, glycerol phosphate shuttle, fatty acid and citric acid cycle dehydrogenases, are responsible for meeting tissue specific differences in maximal rate and range in ATP utilization without displacing metabolic homeostasis.

"Introduction: The degree to which smokers quit successfully with varenicline is strongly associated with their adherence to the medication regimen. Thus, measuring varenicline adherence to identify smokers needing additional intervention is a priority. Few studies, however, have examined the validity of self-reported varenicline adherence, using a biological assessment of adherence as a reference. No study has examined this issue among cancer patients trying to quit smoking, who may show unique patterns of adherence given their medical comorbidity. Methods: This study used data from 76 cancer patients who received varenicline and provided self-reported varenicline adherence data (pill count) and a blood sample to determine varenicline metabolites 4weeks after initiating varenicline. Results: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses of plasma varenicline levels showed that 4ng/ml was the optimal cut-point for differentiating adherence with significant (p's<0.04) area under the curve values, ranging from 0.73-0.80 for 3-day, 7-day, and 4-week self-reported pill count; specificity values ranged from 0.63-0.78 and sensitivity values ranged from 0.82-0.94. Using this cut-point, adherence was high (88%). However, plasma varenicline levels were weakly correlated with 3-day and 4-week pill count and total pill count (12weeks) was not correlated with plasma varenicline levels. Patients with head and neck cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and more advanced disease showed lower varenicline adherence and lower plasma varenicline. Conclusions: Using the 4ng/ml cut-point, this study suggests validity of short-term self-reported varenicline adherence among cancer patients undergoing tobacco dependence treatment in contrast to studies in the general population, which supported 12-week pill count.",The association between self-reported varenicline adherence and varenicline blood levels in a sample of cancer patients receiving treatment for tobacco dependence.
"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a toxic secondary fungal metabolite that widely takes place in various kinds of foodstuffs and feeds. Human beings and animals are inevitably threatened by OTA as a result. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt various measures to detoxify OTA-contaminated foods and feeds. Biological detoxification methods, with better safety, flavor, nutritional quality, organoleptic properties, availability, and cost-effectiveness, are more promising than physical and chemical detoxification methods. The state-of-the-art research advances of OTA biodetoxification by degradation, adsorption, or enzymes are reviewed in the present paper. Researchers have discovered a good deal of microorganisms that could degrade and/or adsorb OTA, including actinobacteria, bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeast. The degradation of OTA to non-toxic or less toxic OTalpha via the hydrolysis of the amide bond is the most important OTA biodegradation mechanism. The most important influence factor of OTA adsorption capacity of microorganisms is cell wall components. A large number of microorganisms with good OTA degradation and/or adsorption ability, as well as some OTA degradation enzymes isolated or cloned from microorganisms and animal pancreas, have great application prospects in food and feed industries.",Advances in Biodetoxification of Ochratoxin A-A Review of the Past Five Decades.
"Viral DNA genomes have limited coding capacity and therefore harness cellular factors to facilitate replication of their genomes and generate progeny virions. Studies of viruses and how they interact with cellular processes have historically provided seminal insights into basic biology and disease mechanisms. The replicative life cycles of many DNA viruses have been shown to engage components of the host DNA damage and repair machinery. Viruses have evolved numerous strategies to navigate the cellular DNA damage response. By hijacking and manipulating cellular replication and repair processes, DNA viruses can selectively harness or abrogate distinct components of the cellular machinery to complete their life cycles. Here, we highlight consequences for viral replication and host genome integrity during the dynamic interactions between virus and host.",Virus DNA Replication and the Host DNA Damage Response.
"Computationally designed transmembrane alpha-helical peptides (CHAMP) have been used to compete for helix-helix interactions within the membrane, enabling the ability to probe the activation of the integrins alphaIIbbeta3 and alphavbeta3. Here, this method is extended towards the design of CHAMP peptides that inhibit the association of the alpha5beta1 transmembrane (TM) domains, targeting the Ala-X3-Gly motif within alpha5. Our previous design algorithm was performed alongside a new workflow implemented within the widely used Rosetta molecular modeling suite. Peptides from each computational approach activated integrin alpha5beta1 but not alphaVbeta3 in human endothelial cells. Two CHAMP peptides were shown to directly associate with an alpha5 TM domain peptide in detergent micelles to a similar degree as a beta1 TM peptide does. By solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance, one of these CHAMP peptides was shown to bind primarily the integrin beta1 TM domain, which itself has a Gly-X3-Gly motif. The second peptide associated modestly with both alpha5 and beta1 constructs, with slight preference for alpha5. Although the design goal was not fully realized, this work characterizes novel CHAMP peptides activating alpha5beta1 that can serve as useful reagents for probing integrin biology.",De novo designed transmembrane peptides activating the alpha5beta1 integrin.
"Emotions are at the core of human cognition and behavior. Traditionally, emotions have been classified dichotomously as being either positive or negative. However, recent behavioral research (An et al., 2017) suggests that emotions contain both positivity and negativity. The current work investigated neural correlates of experiencing positive and negative emotions in response to happy and sad photos. Functional MRI revealed the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex showed stronger activation when experiencing positivity compared to negativity of sadness, but not happiness, whereas the bilateral cerebellum showed greater response to positivity than negativity regardless of emotion. Results suggest that there are similarities and differences in the neural activation of positivity and negativity of happiness and sadness, consistent with previous findings (An et al., 2017). Emotion from both the neural and psychological perspectives were investigated. Further implications are discussed.",Neural activation in response to the two sides of emotion.
"BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have uncovered common variants at many loci influencing human complex traits, such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). However, the contribution of the identified genes is difficult to ascertain from current efforts interrogating common variants with small effects. Thus, there is a pressing need for scalable, cost-effective strategies for uncovering causal variants, many of which may be rare and noncoding. METHODS: Here, we used a molecular inversion probe target capture approach to resequence both coding and regulatory regions at 7 HDL-C-associated loci in 797 individuals with extremely high HDL-C versus 735 low-to-normal HDL-C controls. Our targets included protein-coding regions of GALNT2, APOA5, APOC3, SCARB1, CCDC92, ZNF664, CETP, and LIPG (>9 kb) and proximate noncoding regulatory features (>42 kb). RESULTS: Exome-wide genotyping in 1114 of the 1532 participants yielded a >90% genotyping concordance rate with molecular inversion probe-identified variants in approximately 90% of participants. This approach rediscovered nearly all established genome-wide association studies associations in GALNT2, CETP, and LIPG loci with significant and concordant associations with HDL-C from our phenotypic extremes design at 0.1% of the sample size of lipid genome-wide association studies. In addition, we identified a novel, rare, CETP noncoding variant enriched in the extreme high HDL-C group (P<0.01, score test). CONCLUSIONS: Our targeted resequencing of individuals at the HDL-C phenotypic extremes offers a novel, efficient, and cost-effective approach for identifying rare coding and noncoding variation differences in extreme phenotypes and supports the rationale for applying this methodology to uncover rare variation-particularly noncoding variation-underlying myriad complex traits.",Multiplexed Targeted Resequencing Identifies Coding and Regulatory Variation Underlying Phenotypic Extremes of High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Humans.
"BACKGROUND: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and its consequent unfolded protein response (UPR) are believed to be associated with progression, survival and chemoresistance of a variety of tumor cells through multiple cellular processes, including autophagy. Therefore, the ER stress-autophagy pathway presents a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ER stress and autophagy modulators in the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: We first targeted IRE1alpha, an important regulator of the UPR, through STF-083010 treatment in PDAC cell lines in vitro. Chloroquine was then used to target autophagy and an optimal combination treatment was developed using chloroquine, sunitinib and gemcitabine. Apoptosis was analyzed using TUNEL assay, autophagy was estimated using lysotracker staining and electron microscopy, and UPR was analyzed using anti-GRP78 immunostaining and XBP1 splicing. Transplantation of PDAC derived KPCP1 and Panc02 cells in mouse pancreas were performed to study treatment efficacy in vivo. RESULTS: Suppression of the IRE1alpha by STF-083010 alone resulted in increased lysosomes and reduced viability of PDAC cells. Chloroquine treatment alone inhibited downstream autophagy but was insufficient in reducing PDAC cell growth. However, combining STF-083010 and chloroquine had additive anti-tumor efficacy when used with gemcitabine. Sunitinib alone caused abnormal maturation of the autolysosomes with increased intracellular multivesicular bodies and increased apoptosis evident in PDAC cells. Sunitinib showed a synergistic effect with chloroquine in reducing in vitro PDAC cell viability and significantly increased the efficacy of gemcitabine in human and murine PDAC cell lines. The anti-proliferative effect of gemcitabine was significantly increased when used in combination with sunitinib and/or chloroquine in both in vitro and in vivo PDAC models. The addition of sunitinib and/or chloroquine to gemcitabine, resulted in a significantly increased survival of the animals without noticeably increased toxicity. Sunitinib, gemcitabine and chloroquine treated mice showed a significant reduction of GRP78 expression, reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in pancreas, compatible with a tumor response. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib combined with chloroquine reduces tumor growth through suppression of autophagy and increased apoptosis. Co-administration of modulators of ER stress-mediated autophagy with chemotherapy presents a novel therapeutic approach in PDAC.",Inhibition of endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-mediated autophagy enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics on pancreatic cancer.
"PURPOSE: To review the clinical presentation, disease severity, and surgical interventions of children with thyroid eye disease (TED) at a single institution over a 7-year period. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of children 0 to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of TED, seen at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 2009 to 2016. Ophthalmic examination findings, neuroimaging study results, and ophthalmological management were recorded. t-Tests were used to test for statistical significance. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for the study. RESULTS: Sixty-seven subjects with pediatric TED were studied: 59 female and 8 male. The mean age at diagnosis was 11.6 years (SD 4.2, range 2.3-17.9). All subjects had proptosis (67, 100%). Other clinical findings were eyelid retraction in 46 (69%), chemosis in 7 (10%), punctate epithelial erosions in 8 (12%), and strabismus in 1 (1.5%). No subjects had evidence of optic neuropathy. Five subjects with static-phase TED received orbital decompression surgery for exposure keratopathy and disfigurement. All had significant cosmetic improvement and resolution of exposure keratopathy. DISCUSSION: In this series, children with TED generally exhibit mild ocular signs, which is in agreement with past studies. Our study presented a high incidence of proptosis compared with other studies; however, this may represent a referral bias to our quaternary care center. CONCLUSION: Pediatric TED patients exhibit mild symptoms, such as proptosis and eyelid retraction without strabismus, vision loss, or optic neuropathy. Some children with TED have severe disfigurement and corneal exposure due to the disease and benefit from orbital decompression.",Pediatric Thyroid Eye Disease: Clinical Characteristics and Orbital Decompression Outcomes.
"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Nonprofit hospitals achieve tax exemption through community benefit investments. The objective of this study was to characterize urban and suburban nonprofit hospitals' community benefit expenditures and to estimate regional per capita community benefit spending relative to community need. Community benefit expenditures, both overall and by subtype, were compared for urban versus suburban nonprofit hospitals in a large metropolitan area, the greater Philadelphia region. Estimated zip code-level per capita expenditures were mapped in the urban core area. We found that urban hospitals report higher overall community benefit expenditures than suburban hospitals yet invest less in community health improvement services, both proportionally and absolutely, despite spending similar proportions on charity care. There is an overlap in hospital-identified community benefit service areas in the urban core, but the degree of overlap is not related to community poverty levels. There is significant variation in zip code-level per capita community benefit expenditures, which does not correlate with community need. Community benefit investments offer the potential to improve community health, yet without regional coordination, the ability to maximize the potential of these investments is limited. This study's findings highlight the need to implement policies that increase transparency, accountability, and regional coordination of community benefit spending.",Developing Data to Support Effective Coordination of Nonprofit Hospital Community Benefit Investments.
"Significance: Culture-independent methods have revealed the diverse and dynamic bacterial communities that colonize chronic wounds. Only recently have studies begun to examine fungal colonization and interactions with the bacterial component of the microbiome, their relationship with the host, and influence on wound outcomes. Recent Advances: Studies using culture-independent sequencing methods reveal that fungi often go undetected in wounds. Candida spp. and Cladosporidium spp. are the most commonly identified fungi in wounds. The wound environment may promote multispecies biofilm formation between bacteria and fungi in wounds, with implications for pathogenicity, treatment, and outcomes. Critical Issues: Identifying microorganisms that are problematic for healing will require a comprehensive understanding of all members of the polymicrobial wound community, including fungi and bacteria. Improved reference databases and bioinformatics tools for studying fungal communities will stimulate further research into the fungal microbiome. Future Directions: Continued study of polymicrobial wound communities using culture-independent methods will further our understanding of the relationships between microbial bioburden, the host response, and impact on healing, complications, and patient outcomes. Future studies should encompass all types of microbiota, including fungi, and focus on potential multi-kingdom interactions that contribute to pathogenicity, biofilm formation, and poor outcomes.",Fungi in the Wound Microbiome.
"Microvesicles (MVs) have been shown to be involved in pathophysiology of ischemic heart diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here we investigated the effects of MVs derived from ischemic preconditioning (IPC-MVs) on myocardial ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Myocardial IPC model was elicited by three cycles of ischemia and reperfusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. IPC-MVs from the peripheral blood of the above animal model were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. IPC-MVs were administered intravenously (7 mg/kg) at 5 min before reperfusion procedure in I/R injury model which was induced by 30-min ischemia and 120-min reperfusion of LAD in rats. We found that total IPC-MVs and different phenotypes, including platelet-derived MVs (PMVs), endothelial cell-derived MVs (EMVs), leucocyte-derived MVs and erythrocyte-derived MVs (RMVs) were all isolated which were identified membrane vesicles (< 1 microm) with corresponding antibody positive. The numbers of PMVs, EMVs and RMVs were significantly increased in circulation of IPC treated rats respectively. Additionally, treatment with IPC-MVs significantly alleviated damage of myocardium, and restored cardiac function of I/R injury rats, as evidenced by increased heart rate, and decreased the elevation of ST-segment. The size of myocardial infarction, lactate dehydrogenase activity, and the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes were also reduced significantly with IPC-MVs treatment, coincident with the above function amelioration. Moreover, IPC-MVs decreased the activity of caspase 3, and the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) markers, GRP78, CHOP and caspase 12 indicating the involvement of ERS-specific apoptosis in I/R injury, and cardioprotective effects of IPC-MVs. In summary, our study demonstrated a novel mechanism of IPC in which circulating IPC-MVs could protect hearts from I/R injury in rats through attenuation of ERS-induced apoptosis. These findings provide new insight into therapeutic potential of IPC-induced MVs in cardioprotection against I/R injury.",Protective effects of circulating microvesicles derived from ischemic preconditioning on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress.
"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with worse 1-year neurologic outcomes and reduced access to rehabilitation services in children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: From 2010 to 2014, the Vascular effects of Infection in Pediatric Stroke (VIPS) observational study prospectively enrolled and confirmed 355 children (age 29 days-18 years) with AIS at 37 international centers. SES markers measured via parental interview included annual household income (US dollars) at the time of enrollment, maternal education level, and rural/suburban/urban residence. Receipt of rehabilitation services was measured by parental report. Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure scores were categorized as 0 to 1, 1.5 to 3, 3.5 to 6, and 6.5 to 10. Univariate and multivariable ordinal logistic regression models examined potential predictors of outcome. RESULTS: At 12 +/- 3 months after stroke, 320 children had documented outcome measurements, including 15 who had died. In univariate analysis, very low income (<US $10,000), but not other markers of SES, was associated with worse outcomes (odds ratio [OR] 3.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-6.88, p = 0.004). In multivariable analysis, including adjustment for stroke etiology, this association persisted (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.18-8.47, p = 0.02). Income did not correlate with receiving rehabilitation services at 1 year after stroke; however, quality and quantity of services were not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multinational, prospective cohort of children with AIS, low income was associated with worse neurologic outcomes compared to higher income levels. This difference was not explained by stroke type, neurologic comorbidities, or reported use of rehabilitation services. The root causes of this disparity are not clear and warrant further investigation.",Socioeconomic determinants of outcome after childhood arterial ischemic stroke.
"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a disorder of increasing prevalence worldwide, causing clinical symptoms of vomiting, failure to thrive, and dysphagia and complications of esophageal remodeling with strictures and food impactions. Molecular profiling demonstrates EoE to be an eosinophil-predominant disorder with a TH2 cytokine profile reminiscent of other allergic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Environmental antigens in the form of foods and aeroallergens induce eosinophil, basophil, mast cell, and T-cell infiltration. Pathogenesis depends on local epithelial immune activation with production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin and eotaxin-3. Complications mirror asthmatic airway pathogenesis, with increases in subepithelial collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and smooth muscle hypertrophy. The removal of instigating antigens, especially foods, causes disease resolution in more than 50% of adults and children. The prevalence of concurrent atopic disorders in patients with EoE and the need to control antigen-specific TH2 inflammation underscore the importance of testing for allergens and treating the entire atopic subject to control the potential interplay between organ-specific allergic responses.",Allergic components of eosinophilic esophagitis.
"BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease that currently lacks effective targeted therapy. NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs) are expressed on various tumor types and immunosuppressive cells within tumor microenvironments, providing suitable targets for cancer therapy. METHODS: We applied a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) approach for the targeting of NKG2DLs expressed on human TNBCs. Lentiviral vectors were used to express the extracellular domain of human NKG2D that binds various NKG2DLs, fused to signaling domains derived from T cell receptor CD3 zeta alone or with CD27 or 4-1BB (CD137) costimulatory domain. RESULTS: Interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoted the expansion and self-enrichment of NKG2D-redirected CAR T cells in vitro. High CD25 expression on first-generation NKG2D CAR T cells was essential for the self-enrichment effect in the presence of IL-2, but not for CARs containing CD27 or 4-1BB domains. Importantly, self-enriched NKG2D CAR T cells effectively recognized and eliminated TNBC cell lines in vitro, and adoptive transfer of T cells expressing NKG2D CARs with CD27 or 4-1BB specifically enhanced NKG2D CAR surface expression, T cell persistence, and the regression of established MDA-MB-231 TNBC in vivo. NKG2D-z CAR T cells lacking costimulatory domains were less effective, highlighting the need for costimulatory signals. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that CD27 or 4-1BB costimulated, self-enriched NKG2D CAR-redirected T cells mediate anti-tumor activity against TNBC tumor, which represent a promising immunotherapeutic approach to TNBC treatment.","Control of triple-negative breast cancer using ex vivo self-enriched, costimulated NKG2D CAR T cells."
"The United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA) serves more than 9 million enrolled Veterans each year. Although most of the care that the VHA sponsors is delivered within its own facilities, there has been a call for ""privatizing"" some or all of these services. Under such an arrangement, the Department of Veterans Affairs would pay non-VHA providers to deliver care in facilities open to the general public. Privatization is hotly contested on political grounds and is not resolved. Yet the question whether the VHA should be privatized cannot be resolved without first establishing that this policy change is even feasible. One potential obstacle to privatization would be the lack of nearby alternative facilities to deliver care. To assess for the presence of this impediment, we used Google Maps to measure the travel time between 167 VA hospitals and the teaching hospital nearest to each of them. We determined that the mean travel time between VA hospitals and their nearest teaching hospital was approximately 18 minutes with a median of 10 minutes. All but nine VA facilities were within two hours' travel, and these nine within ten minutes' travel to a tertiary care, nonteaching hospital. These data do not definitively resolve the privatization debate, of course, but do refute the assertion that inpatient VA services cannot be privatized because replacement hospitals are too far away. As shown, that is simply not the case.",Teaching hospital alternatives for Veterans Health Administration facilities: A Google Maps proximity study.

"The advent of next-generation sequencing has changed genetic diagnostics, allowing clinicians to test concurrently for phenotypically overlapping conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, to interpret genetic results, clinicians require an understanding of the benefits and limitations of different genetic technologies, such as the inability to detect large repeat expansions in such diseases as C9orf72-associated FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Other types of mutations such as large deletions or duplications and triple repeat expansions may also go undetected. Additionally, the concurrent testing of multiple genes or the whole exome increases the likelihood of discovering variants of unknown significance. Our goal here is to review the current knowledge about the genetics of AD and FTD and suggest up-to-date guidelines for genetic testing for these dementias. Despite the improvements in diagnosis due to biomarkers testing, AD and FTD can have overlapping symptoms. When used appropriately, genetic testing can elucidate the diagnosis and specific etiology of the disease, as well as provide information for the family and determine eligibility for clinical trials. Prior to ordering genetic testing, clinicians must determine the appropriate genes to test, the types of mutations that occur in these genes, and the best type of genetic test to use. Without this analysis, interpretation of genetic results will be difficult. Patients should be counseled about the benefits and limitations of different types of genetic tests so they can make an informed decision about testing.",Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia: The Current State of Genetics and Genetic Testing Since the Advent of Next-Generation Sequencing.
"Suicide is a serious public health concern in the US, especially for those served in outpatient behavioral health. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in US suicide rates, and a significant proportion of those dying by or attempting suicide were treated in outpatient behavioral healthcare within the prior year.

"Exposure to social stress is an important risk factor for comorbid affective disorders and problem alcohol use. To better understand mechanisms involved in social stress-induced affective disorder and alcohol use co-morbidity, we studied the effects of adolescent social stress on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and binge-like ethanol consumption. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic variable social stress (CVSS) or control conditions throughout adolescence (postnatal days, PND, 25-59) and then tested for anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and a novel open field environment, or depression-like behavior using the forced swim test on PND 64-66. Mice were then tested for binge-like ethanol consumption using the Drinking-in-the-Dark model. Male and female mice exposed to adolescent CVSS had increased adult anxiety-like behavior and increased locomotor adaptation to a novel environment. Further, CVSS mice consumed significantly more ethanol, but not saccharin, than controls. Despite group differences in both anxiety-like behavior and ethanol consumption, there was no relationship between these outcomes within individual mice. These data suggest that exposure to adolescent social stress is an important risk factor for later alcohol use and affective behaviors, but that social stress does not necessarily dictate co-morbidity of these outcomes.",Adolescent social stress increases anxiety-like behavior and ethanol consumption in adult male and female C57BL/6J mice.
"Some HIV-associated complications involve mitochondrial dysfunction and may be less common in individuals with iron-loading HFE (hemochromatosis gene) variants.

"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the carrier frequencies of hearing loss gene variants, such as GJB2, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1 in newborns of China. DESIGN: PubMed, Embase, BioCentral, CNKI, WanFang, and VIP databases were used for searching relevant literature studies published during the period of January 2007 and January 2016. Meta-analysis was performed by using the R software. The estimated rate and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the relevant indexes in newborns were collected and calculated using a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model when appropriate. RESULTS: In total, 35 of 958 published literature studies in Chinese and English were selected. The overall results showed that in newborns of China, the carrier frequencies of GJB2 variants (235 delC, 299 delAT) were 1.64% (95% CI 1.52% to 1.77%) and 0.33% (95% CI 0.19% to 0.51%); SLC26A4 variants (IVS7-2 A > G, 2168 A > G) were 1.02% (95% CI 0.91% to 1.15%) and 0.14% (95% CI 0.06% to 0.25%); MT-RNR1 variants (1555 A > G, 1449 C > T) were 0.20% (95% CI 0.17% to 0.23%) and 0.03% (95% CI 0.02% to 0.05%).

"Integration of detailed phenotype information with genetic data is well established to facilitate accurate diagnosis of hereditary disorders. As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p < 2.2 x 10(-16)), supporting the value of phenotype-driven gene prioritization in diagnostic sequence interpretation. To assess the generalizability, we replicated this finding on an independent EHR dataset of ten individuals with a positive diagnosis from a different institution. We then assessed the broader utility by examining two additional EHR datasets, including 31 individuals who were suspected of having a Mendelian disease and underwent different types of genetic testing and 20 individuals with positive diagnoses of specific Mendelian etiologies of chronic kidney disease from exome sequencing. Finally, through several retrospective case studies, we demonstrated how combined analyses of genotype data and deep phenotype data from EHRs can expedite genetic diagnoses. In summary, EHR-Phenolyzer leverages EHR narratives to automate phenotype-driven analysis of clinical exomes or genomes, facilitating the broader implementation of genomic medicine.",Deep Phenotyping on Electronic Health Records Facilitates Genetic Diagnosis by Clinical Exomes.
"Use of oral agents to treat gestational diabetes mellitus remains controversial. Recent recommendations from the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine assert that metformin may be a safe first-line alternative to insulin for gestational diabetes mellitus treatment and preferable to glyburide. However, several issues should give pause to the widespread adoption of metformin use during pregnancy. Fetal concentrations of metformin are equal to maternal, and metformin can inhibit growth, suppress mitochondrial respiration, have epigenetic modifications on gene expression, mimic fetal nutrient restriction, and alter postnatal gluconeogenic responses. Because both the placenta and fetus express metformin transporters and exhibit high mitochondrial activity, these properties raise important questions about developmental programming of metabolic disease in offspring. Animal studies have demonstrated that prenatal metformin exposure results in adverse long-term outcomes on body weight and metabolism. Two recent clinical randomized controlled trials in women with gestational diabetes mellitus or polycystic ovary syndrome provide evidence that metformin exposure in utero may produce a metabolic phenotype that increases childhood weight or obesity. These developmental programming effects challenge the conclusion that metformin is equivalent to insulin. Although the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine statement endorsed metformin over glyburide if oral agents are used, there are few studies directly comparing the 2 agents and it is not clear that metformin alone is superior to glyburide. Moreover, it should be noted that prior clinical studies have dosed glyburide in a manner inconsistent with its pharmacokinetic properties, resulting in poor glycemic control and high rates of maternal hypoglycemia. We concur with the American Diabetes Association and American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which recommend insulin as the preferred agent, but we believe that it is premature to embrace metformin as equivalent to insulin or superior to glyburide. Due to the uncertainty of the long-term metabolic risks of either metformin or glyburide, we call for carefully controlled studies that optimize oral medication dosing according to their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in pregnancy, appropriately target medications based on individual patterns of hyperglycemia, and follow the offspring long-term for metabolic risk.",A cautionary response to SMFM statement: pharmacological treatment of gestational diabetes.

Despite this recognized value, the current landscape of academic medicine presents significant barriers to establishing and maintaining a successful career as a surgeon performing basic/translational research. Our objective is to define these barriers to academic success for surgeons, and to provide a consensus strategy for optimizing the chances of success. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There is a significant decline in the proportion of academic surgeons who are pursuing basic science/translational research, which represents a potential threat to the very identify of the translational surgeon-scientist. METHODS: Based on published literature and expert opinion, the Basic Science Committee of the Society of University of Surgeons prepared this roadmap to encourage and guide the next generation of surgeon-scientists as they embark on their academic careers. RESULTS: This roadmap highlights key elements to consider in choosing an initial job and the importance of identifying a team of committed mentors. Expectations and guidelines for the first several years in practice are offered. CONCLUSIONS: With guidance and mentorship, aspiring surgeonscientists can overcome the challenges inherent in choosing this career path and sustain the important legacy of those before them.",A Roadmap for Aspiring Surgeon-Scientists in Today's Healthcare Environment.
The goal of this study was to compare open reduction versus percutaneous fixation of adolescent ankle fractures with regards to the incidence of growth disturbance. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adolescent patients with triplane or Tillaux fractures. There was an even distribution of triplane fractures and mean initial displacement between cohorts. Analysis of follow-up radiographs revealed no instances of growth disturbance in the percutaneous fixation group and six in the open reduction group (P=0.29). Growth disturbance does not pose a significant concern when selecting a surgical approach. Owing to the rarity of these fractures this study was underpowered.,Percutaneous versus open reduction and fixation for Tillaux and triplane fractures: a multicenter cohort comparison study.
"Organisms evolving toward greater complexity were selected across aeons to use energy and resources efficiently. Efficiency depended on prediction at every stage: first a clock to predict the planet's statistical regularities; then a brain to predict bodily needs and compute commands that dynamically adjust the flows of energy and nutrients. Predictive regulation (allostasis) frugally matches resources to needs and thus forms a core principle of our design. Humans, reaching a pinnacle of cognitive complexity, eventually produced a device (the steam engine) that converted thermal energy to work and were suddenly awash in resources. Today boundless consumption in many nations challenges all our regulatory mechanisms, causing obesity, diabetes, drug addiction and their sequelae. So far we have sought technical solutions, such as drugs, to treat complex circuits for metabolism, appetites and mood. Here I argue for a different approach which starts by asking: why does our regulatory system, which evolution tuned for small satisfactions, now constantly demand 'more'?",Predictive regulation and human design.
"Progranulin is a 67-88 kDa glycoprotein, also known as acrogranin, PC-cell-derived growth factor, granulin-epithelin precursor, and proepithelin. This protein is present in a variety of mouse, rat, and human tissues. Progranulin, which is a growth factor, mediates cell cycle progression and cell migration in normal and pathological conditions. In several types of cancers, progranulin expression is upregulated, whereas function-interfering mutations in the granulin gene in humans have been linked to a subset of heritable cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Also, progranulin has important effects on mouse preimplantation embryo development in vitro, including regulation of the appearance of the epithelium in the developing mouse blastocyst and growth of trophectoderm. Furthermore, progranulin promotes mouse blastocyst hatching, adhesion, and outgrowth in vitro. In this chapter, we describe some of the techniques that may be useful in the study of progranulin in embryo development.",Methods to Study the Role of Progranulin in Preimplantation Mouse Embryo Development.
"PURPOSE: Sport-specific, performance-based outcomes are increasingly used to improve evaluation of treatment efficacy in elite athletes; however, its usage in elite soccer may be limited. The purpose of this investigation is to (1) assess current outcome reporting in elite soccer; (2) identify any variability in reporting of outcomes; and (3) determine how sport-specific performance-based outcomes are utilized to assess treatment efficacy in elite soccer. METHODS: A systematic review of the Pubmed, MEDLINE, and Embase, Scopus, SportDiscus, CINAHL and HealthSource: Nursing databases was performed without limitation on publication year. Inclusion criteria were (1) reporting of outcomes after a (2) lower extremity injury in (3) elite soccer players. The study's population, type of injury, return to play, as well as functional, objective, and sport-specific performance-based outcomes were extracted from each article. The methodological index for nonrandomized studies was used for quality assessment. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were selected after application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Objective outcomes were reported by 6 (29%) studies, and 6 (29%) employed patient-reported outcomes. The visual analog scale, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were the most common patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Return to play was reported by 18 (86%) studies, and only 2 (10%) utilized sport-specific performance-based outcomes. Despite the majority of studies reporting return to play, variation was seen in the definitions, and 15 (71%) studies reported the activity level of the players at final follow-up. CONCLUSION: Assessment of treatment efficacy is limited in elite athletes, and PROs lack the sensitivity to identify residual performance deficits after an injury. Although performance-based measures are available at the elite level, these outcomes were seldom used for evaluation of treatment efficacy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When treating elite soccer players, patient-reported outcome measures lack the sensitivity to detect changes in patient function, thus performance-based metrics may be more efficacious in assessing return from injury in these patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",The lack of standardized outcome measures following lower extremity injury in elite soccer: a systematic review.
"Delineating the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders has been extremely challenging but technological advances in recent decades have facilitated a deeper interrogation of molecular processes in the human brain. Initial candidate gene expression studies of the postmortem brain have evolved into genome wide profiling of the transcriptome and the epigenome, a critical regulator of gene expression. Here, we review the potential and challenges of direct molecular characterization of the postmortem human brain, and provide a brief overview of recent transcriptional and epigenetic studies with respect to neuropsychiatric disorders. Such information can now be leveraged and integrated with the growing number of genome-wide association databases to provide a functional context of trait-associated genetic variants linked to psychiatric illnesses and related phenotypes. While it is clear that the field is still developing and challenges remain to be surmounted, these recent advances nevertheless hold tremendous promise for delineating the neurobiological underpinnings of mental diseases and accelerating the development of novel medication strategies.",Molecular windows into the human brain for psychiatric disorders.
"OBJECTIVE: To identify behavioral health provider perspectives on gaps in mental health care for youth with rheumatologic conditions. METHODS: Social workers (n=34) and psychologists (n=8) at pediatric rheumatology centers in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) completed an online survey assessing current practices and mental health care needs of youth with rheumatologic conditions. Responses were compared to a published survey of CARRA rheumatologists (n=119). Thematic analysis of 20 semi-structured interviews with behavioral health providers was performed. RESULTS: One third of CARRA centers (n=100) had no affiliated social worker or psychologist. Only one behavioral health provider reported current universal mental health screening at their rheumatology clinic, yet routine depression screening was supported by >85% of behavioral health providers and rheumatologists. Support for anxiety screening was higher among behavioral health providers (90% vs 65%, p<0.01). Interviews illustrated a need for interventions addressing illness-related anxiety, adjustment/coping/distress, transition, parent/caregiver mental health, and peer support. Limited resources, lack of protocols, and patient cost/time burden were the most frequent barriers to intervention. Inadequate follow-up of mental health referrals was indicated by 52%. More behavioral health providers than rheumatologists favored mental health services in rheumatology settings (55% vs 19%, p<0.01). Only 7 social workers (21%) provided counseling/therapy, and interviews indicated their perceived under-utilization for these services. CONCLUSION: Behavioral health providers indicate an unmet need for mental health interventions addressing illness-related issues affecting youth with rheumatologic conditions. Implementation of mental health protocols and optimizing utilization of social workers may improve mental health care for these youth. This article is protected by copyright.

"AT-rich interactive domain-containing proteins 1A and 1B (ARID1A and ARID1B) are mutually exclusive subunits of the chromatin remodeler SWI/SNF. ARID1A is the most frequently mutated chromatin regulator across all cancers, and ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) carries the highest prevalence of ARID1A mutations ( approximately 57%). Despite evidence implicating ARID1A in tumorigenesis, the mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ARID1A binds active regulatory elements in OCCC. Depletion of ARID1A represses RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription but results in modest changes to accessibility. Specifically, pausing of RNAPII is severely impaired after loss of ARID1A. Compromised pausing results in transcriptional dysregulation of active genes, which is compensated by upregulation of ARID1B. However, a subset of ARID1A-dependent genes is not rescued by ARID1B, including many p53 and estrogen receptor (ESR1) targets. Our results provide insight into ARID1A-mediated tumorigenesis and unveil functions of SWI/SNF in modulating RNAPII dynamics.",The Tumor Suppressor ARID1A Controls Global Transcription via Pausing of RNA Polymerase II.
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be key modulators of post-transcriptional gene silencing in many cellular processes. In previous studies designed to understand the role of miRNAs in thymic development, we globally deleted miRNA exclusively in thymic epithelial cells (TECs), which are critical in thymic selection. This resulted in the loss of stromal cells that instruct T cell lineage commitment and affect thymocyte positive selection, required for mature T cell development. Since murine miR-181 is expressed in the thymus and miR-181 deficiency disrupts thymocyte development, we first quantified and thereby demonstrated that miR181a1 and miR181b1 are expressed in purified TECs. By generating mice with TEC targeted loss of miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 expression, we observed that neither TEC cellularity nor thymocyte number nor differentiation was adversely affected. Thus, disrupted thymopoiesis in miR-181 deficient mice was not due to miR-181 loss of expression in TECs. Importantly, in mice with restricted TEC deficiency of miR-181a1 and miR-181b1, there were similar numbers of mature T cells in the periphery in regards to frequencies, differentiation, and function as compared to controls. Moreover miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 were not required for maintenance of thymus integrity over time, as thymic involution was not accelerated in gene-targeted mice. Taken together our data indicate that miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 are dispensable for TEC differentiation, their control of thymocyte development and mature T cell export to and homeostasis within the periphery.","Despite high levels of expression in thymic epithelial cells, miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 are not required for thymic development."
"Mobile health interventions to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy among adolescents and young adults living with HIV represent a promising strategy. This pilot study (N = 37) evaluated the psychosocial impacts of an efficacious adherence intervention, cell phone support (CPS). Participants receiving CPS reported significant decreases in perceived stress, depression, and illicit substance use, and increases in self-efficacy during at least one study assessment period, in comparison to participants receiving usual care. Future research using a larger sample should test for mediators of treatment efficacy to further characterize how cell phone interventions impact adherence.",The Impact of Cell Phone Support on Psychosocial Outcomes for Youth Living with HIV Nonadherent to Antiretroviral Therapy.
"Purpose: Recent advances in adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) have enabled visualization of cone inner segments through nonconfocal split-detection, in addition to rod and cone outer segments revealed by confocal reflectance. Here, we examined the interobserver reliability of cone density measurements in both AOSLO imaging modalities. Methods: Five normal subjects (nine eyes) were imaged along the horizontal and vertical meridians using a custom AOSLO with confocal and nonconfocal split-detection modalities. The resulting images were montaged using a previously described semiautomatic algorithm. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected from the confocal montage at 190 mum, and from split-detection and confocal montages at 900 and 1800 mum from the fovea. Four observers (three experts, one naive) manually identified cone locations in each ROI, and these locations were used to calculate bound densities. Intraclass correlation coefficients and Dice's coefficients were calculated to assess interobserver agreement. Results: Interobserver agreement was high in cone-only images (confocal 190 mum: 0.85; split-detection 900 mum: 0.91; split-detection 1800 mum: 0.89), moderate in confocal images at 900 mum (0.68), and poor in confocal images at 1800 mum (0.24). Excluding the naive observer data substantially increased agreement within confocal images (190 mum: 0.99; 900 mum: 0.80; 1800 mum: 0.68). Conclusions: Interobserver measurements of cone density are more reliable in rod-free retinal images. Moreover, when using manual cell identification, it is essential that observers are trained, particularly for confocal AOSLO images. Translational Relevance: This study underscores the need for additional reliability studies in eyes containing pathology where identifying cones can be substantially more difficult.",The Reliability of Cone Density Measurements in the Presence of Rods.

"To find out if the T cell repertoire is efficiently and specifically provoked in patients with breast cancer, we have investigated the clonotypes of main T cell subsets (based on Vbeta-Chain) in tumor draining lymph nodes. CD4+ helper, CD8+ cytotoxic and (CD4+CD127dimCD25+) regulatory T cells, were negatively selected, and isolated, from lymph node mononuclear cells of 14 untreated patients with breast cancer. Four non-malignant patients, who underwent surgical operation, were also recruited as the control group. Based on sequences and new nomenclature of the T cell Receptor beta Variables (TRBVs) available in the international ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) database, 28 TRBV specific forward primers and two TRB Constant region (TRBC) specific reverse primers were developed to amplify all functional alleles. Fluorescent-labeled PCR products were then run on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic-Analyzer. The data was analyzed by GeneMapper software version 3.1. Clonotype analysis suggested that activated T cells are present in breast cancer. More TRBV usage were detected among CD4+ helper and regulatory subsets, with Gaussian-like pattern in the majority of functional TRBV families; whereas CD8+ cytotoxic T cells showed oligoclonality in almost all TRBV families with one or two dominant peaks in each family. Similar pattern in some of these TRBVs were also observed among controls. Having no expression or polyclonality in the controls, the oligoclonal pattern observed in the TRBV18, however, appears to be specific to breast cancer patients. This phenomenon may reflect the existence of new antigenic stimulation(s) in BC patients, preferentially activating those clones of T cells that express TRBV18.",Analysis of T cell receptor repertoire based on Vbeta chain in patients with breast cancer.
"Evidence suggests that there is an association between polymorphisms in the alpha5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit and risk of developing alcohol dependence in humans. The alpha5 nAChR subunit has also recently been shown to modulate some of the acute response to ethanol in mice. The aim of the current study was to further characterize the role of alpha5-containing (alpha5*) nAChRs in acute ethanol responsive behaviors, ethanol consumption and ethanol preference in mice. We conducted a battery of tests in male alpha5 knockout (KO) mice for a range of ethanol-induced behaviors including hypothermia, hypnosis, and anxiolysis. We also investigated the effects of alpha5* nAChR on ethanol reward using the Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) assay. Further, we tested the effects of gene deletion on drinking behaviors using the voluntary ethanol consumption in a two-bottle choice assay and Drinking in the Dark (DID, with or without stress) paradigm. We found that deletion of the alpha5 nAChR subunit enhanced ethanol-induced hypothermia, hypnosis, and an anxiolytic-like response in comparison to wild-type controls. The alpha5 KO mice showed reduced CPP for ethanol, suggesting that the rewarding properties of ethanol are decreased in mutant mice. Interestingly, Chrna5 gene deletion had no effect on basal ethanol drinking behavior, or ethanol metabolism, but did decrease ethanol intake in the DID paradigm following restraint stress. Taken together, we provide new evidence that alpha5 nAChRs are involved in some but not all of the behavioral effects of ethanol. Our results highlight the importance of nAChRs as a possible target for the treatment of alcohol dependence.",Knockout of alpha 5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors subunit alters ethanol-mediated behavioral effects and reward in mice.

"Purpose In the United States, families with children characterize the fastest growing portion of the homeless population. Parenting for families experiencing homelessness presents unique challenges since families facing homelessness are disproportionately more likely to experience a myriad of interpersonal and contextual stressors that heighten the risk of parents engaging in suboptimal parenting approaches. This article describes the development and implementation of the Family Care Curriculum (FCC) train-the-trainer parenting support program specifically designed to support positive parenting in families experiencing homelessness. Description The FCC is a 6-week theory-based parenting intervention aimed to create positive shifts in parental attitudes to enhance sensitive and nurturing parenting and positive parent-child relationships. FCC assists parents in reflecting on how their own experiences contribute to some of their parenting beliefs, patterns, and behaviors. Parents are coached to imagine and understand the emotions, attachment, and developmental needs behind their children's behaviors so they can maintain empathic and nurturing parenting responses in the context of cumulative and chronic stress. Parents are supported through learning to engage in self-care. A unique and important feature of the FCC is the inclusion of a culturally sensitive approach that takes into consideration the effects of racism, classism, and oppression on parent-child relationships. Conclusion FCC was designed, implemented, and championed by expert providers in the fields of family therapy, social work, and pediatrics to support parents experiencing homelessness. FCC adds to the body of effective attachment-based, trauma-informed, and culturally sensitive parenting interventions for improving parent-child relations and family health amongst vulnerable populations.",Family Care Curriculum: A Parenting Support Program for Families Experiencing Homelessness.

"OBJECTIVE: This study measured a variety of within-exposure fear changes and tested the relationship of each with treatment outcomes in exposure therapy. METHOD: We coded 459 videotaped exposure tasks from 111 participants in 3 clinical trials for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; POTS trials). Within exposures, fear level was observed continuously and alongside exposure process. Fear change metrics of interest were selected for relevance to mechanistic theory. Fear decreases were classified by function; nonhabituation decreases were associated with observed nonlearning processes (e.g., avoidance), whereas habituation decreases appeared to result from an internal and indirect process. Outcomes were posttreatment change in symptom severity, global improvement, and treatment response. RESULTS: Greater cumulative habituation across treatment was associated with larger reductions in symptom severity, greater global improvement, and increased odds of treatment response. Fear activation, fear variability, and nonhabituation fear decreases did not predict any outcomes. Exploratory analyses examined fear changes during habituation and nonhabituation exposures; higher peak fear during nonhabituation exposures was associated with attenuated global improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Habituation is conceptually consistent with multiple mechanistic theories and should continue to be investigated as a practical marker of initial extinction learning and possible moderator of the relationship between fear activation and outcome. Results support the importance of functional and frequent fear measurement during exposures, and discussion considers implications of these findings for future studies aiming to understand learning during exposure and improve exposure delivery.

"The organization of body representations in the adult brain has been well documented. Little is understood about this aspect of brain organization in human infancy. The current study employed electroencephalography (EEG) with 60-day-old infants to test the distribution of brain responses to tactile stimulation of three different body parts: hand, foot, and lip. Analyses focused on a prominent positive response occurring at 150-200 ms in the somatosensory evoked potential at central and parietal electrode sites. The results show differential electrophysiological signatures for touch of these three body parts. Stimulation of the left hand was associated with greater positive amplitude over the lateral central region contralateral to the side stimulated. Left foot stimulation was associated with greater positivity over the midline parietal site. Stimulation of the midline of the upper lip was associated with a strong bilateral response over the central region. These findings provide new insights into the neural representation of the body in infancy and shed light on research and theories about the involvement of somatosensory cortex in infant imitation and social perception.",Neural representations of the body in 60-day-old human infants.

"E2F1 is a transcription factor classically known to regulate G0/G1 to S phase progression in the cell cycle. In addition, E2F1 also regulates a wide range of apoptotic genes and thus has been well studied in the context of neuronal death and neurodegenerative diseases. However, its function and regulation in the mature central nervous system are not well understood. Alternative splicing is a well-conserved post-transcriptional mechanism common in cells of the CNS and is necessary to generate diverse functional modifications to RNA or protein products from genes. Heretofore, physiologically significant alternatively spliced E2F1 transcripts have not been reported. In the present study, we report the identification of two novel alternatively spliced E2F1 transcripts: E2F1b, an E2F1 transcript retaining intron 5, and E2F1c, an E2F1 transcript excluding exon 6. These alternatively spliced transcripts are observed in the brain and neural cell types including neurons, astrocytes, and undifferentiated oligodendrocytes. The expression of these E2F1 transcripts is distinct during maturation of primary hippocampal neuroglial cells. Pharmacologically-induced global translation inhibition with cycloheximide, anisomycin or thapsigargin lead to significantly reduced expression of E2F1a, E2F1b and E2F1c. Conversely, increasing neuronal activity by elevating the concentration of potassium chloride selectively increased the expression of E2F1b. Furthermore, experiments expressing these variants in vitro show the transcripts can be translated to generate a protein product. Taken together, our data suggest that the alternatively spliced E2F1 transcript behave differently than the E2F1a transcript, and our results provide a foundation for future investigation of the function of E2F1 splice variants in the CNS.",Identification and characterization of two novel alternatively spliced E2F1 transcripts in the rat CNS.
"Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children. Experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that the developmental age, the type of injury (diffuse vs. focal) and sex may play important roles in the response of the developing brain to a traumatic injury. Advancements in acute neurosurgical interventions and neurocritical care have improved and led to a decrease in mortality rates over the past decades. However, survivors are left with life-long behavioral deficits underscoring the need to better define the cellular mechanisms underlying these functional changes. A better understanding of these mechanisms some of which begin in the acute post-traumatic period may likely lead to targeted treatment strategies. Key considerations in designing pre-clinical experiments to test therapeutic strategies in pediatric TBI include the use of age-appropriate and pathologically-relevant models, functional outcomes that are tested as animals age into adolescence and beyond, sex as a biological variable and the recognition that doses and dosing strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective in animal models of adult TBI may not be effective in the developing brain.

"Background: Activated vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] deficiency might contribute to subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD). Objective: We examined associations between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and subclinical ILD among middle-aged to older adults who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Methods: We studied 6302 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants who had baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations and computed tomography (CT) imaging spanning </= 10 y. Baseline cardiac CT scans (2000-2002) included partial lung fields. Some participants had follow-up cardiac CT scans at exams 2-5 and a full-lung CT scan at exam 5 (2010-2012), with a mean +/- SD of 2.1 +/- 1.0 scans. Subclinical ILD was defined quantitatively as high-attenuation areas (HAAs) between -600 and -250 Hounsfield units. We assessed associations of 25(OH)D with adjusted HAA volumes and HAA progression. We also examined associations between baseline 25(OH)D and the presence of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) assessed qualitatively (yes or no) from full-lung CT scans at exam 5. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors (including smoking), and lung volumes. Results: The cohort's mean +/- SD characteristics were 62.2 +/- 10 y for age, 25.8 +/- 10.9 ng/mL for 25(OH)D concentrations, and 28.3 +/- 5.4 for body mass index (kg/m2); 53% were women, with 39% white, 27% black, 22% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese race/ethnicities. Thirty-three percent had replete (>/=30 ng/mL), 35% intermediate (20 to <30 ng/mL), and 32% deficient (<20 ng/mL) 25(OH)D concentrations. Compared with those with replete concentrations, participants with 25(OH)D deficiency had greater adjusted HAA volume at baseline (2.7 cm3; 95% CI: 0.9, 4.5 cm3) and increased progression over a median of 4.3 y of follow-up (2.7 cm3; 95% CI: 0.9, 4.4 cm3) (P < 0.05). 25(OH)D deficiency was also associated with increased prevalence of ILAs 10 y later (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.2). Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is independently associated with subclinical ILD and its progression, based on both increased HAAs and ILAs, in a community-based population. Further studies are needed to examine whether vitamin D repletion can prevent ILD or slow its progression.

"Primary tumours establish metastases by interfering with distinct organs. In pre-metastatic organs, a tumour-friendly microenvironment supports metastatic cells and is prepared by many factors including tissue resident cells, bone marrow-derived cells and abundant fibrinogen depositions. However, other components are unclear. Here, we show that a third organ, originally regarded as a bystander, plays an important role in metastasis by directly affecting the pre-metastatic soil. In our model system, the liver participated in lung metastasis as a leucocyte supplier. These liver-derived leucocytes displayed liver-like characteristics and, thus, were designated hepato-entrained leucocytes (HepELs). HepELs had high expression levels of coagulation factor X (FX) and vitronectin (Vtn) and relocated to fibrinogen-rich hyperpermeable regions in pre-metastatic lungs; the cells then switched their expression from Vtn to thrombospondin, both of which were fibrinogen-binding proteins. Cell surface marker analysis revealed that HepELs contained B220(+)CD11c(+)NK1.1(+) cells. In addition, an injection of B220(+)CD11c(+)NK1.1(+) cells successfully eliminated fibrinogen depositions in pre-metastatic lungs via FX Moreover, B220(+)CD11c(+)NK1.1(+) cells demonstrated anti-metastatic tumour ability with IFNgamma induction.

"Current approaches do not eliminate all human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) maternal-to-infant transmissions (MTIT); new prevention paradigms might help avert new infections. We administered maraviroc (MVC) to rhesus macaques (RMs) to block CCR5-mediated entry, followed by repeated oral exposure of a CCR5-dependent clone of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mac251 (SIVmac766). MVC significantly blocked the CCR5 coreceptor in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tissue cells. All control animals and 60% of MVC-treated infant RMs became infected by the 6th challenge, with no significant difference between the number of exposures (P = 0.15). At the time of viral exposures, MVC plasma and tissue (including tonsil) concentrations were within the range seen in humans receiving MVC as a therapeutic. Both treated and control RMs were infected with only a single transmitted/founder variant, consistent with the dose of virus typical of HIV-1 infection. The uninfected RMs expressed the lowest levels of CCR5 on the CD4(+) T cells. Ramp-up viremia was significantly delayed (P = 0.05) in the MVC-treated RMs, yet peak and postpeak viral loads were similar in treated and control RMs. In conclusion, in spite of apparent effective CCR5 blockade in infant RMs, MVC had a marginal impact on acquisition and only a minimal impact on the postinfection delay of viremia following oral SIV infection. Newly developed, more effective CCR5 blockers may have a more dramatic impact on oral SIV transmission than MVC.IMPORTANCE We have previously suggested that the very low levels of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) maternal-to-infant transmissions (MTIT) in African nonhuman primates that are natural hosts of SIVs are due to a low availability of target cells (CCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells) in the oral mucosa of the infants, rather than maternal and milk factors. To confirm this new MTIT paradigm, we performed a proof-of-concept study in which we therapeutically blocked CCR5 with maraviroc (MVC) and orally exposed MVC-treated and naive infant rhesus macaques to SIV. MVC had only a marginal effect on oral SIV transmission. However, the observation that the infant RMs that remained uninfected at the completion of the study, after 6 repeated viral challenges, had the lowest CCR5 expression on the CD4(+) T cells prior to the MVC treatment appears to confirm our hypothesis, also suggesting that the partial effect of MVC is due to a limited efficacy of the drug. New, more effective CCR5 inhibitors may have a better effect in preventing SIV and HIV transmission.",Marginal Effects of Systemic CCR5 Blockade with Maraviroc on Oral Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission to Infant Macaques.

"PURPOSE: To quantitatively describe passive lower extremity range of motion in participants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) types 2 and 3, and to establish preliminary thresholds to identify individuals at risk for performing poorly on disease-specific motor function outcome measures. METHODS: Eighty participants with SMA types 2 and 3, enrolled in an international multicenter natural history study, were evaluated with lower extremity range of motion testing and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded. RESULTS: A hip extension joint angle of -7.5 degrees or less for SMA type 2 and 0 degrees or less for SMA type 3 identified diminished motor ability with good sensitivity. For knee extension, a joint angle of -9.0 degrees or less for SMA type 2 or 0 degrees or less for SMA type 3 was similarly sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal hip and knee joint contractures were associated with diminished motor ability.

Prepared by members of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium, this White Paper summarizes and reports the dialogue at the second Think Tank related to the issues and the proposed solutions for the development of a national resource for screening and prevention of SCDY. This Think Tank, sponsored by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium and the United States Food and Drug Administration, convened on February 18, 2016, in Miami, FL, to identify and resolve the barriers that prevent early identification of patients at risk for SCDY. All potential stakeholders including national and international experts from industry, medicine, academics, engineering, and community advocacy leaders had an opportunity to share ideas and collaborate.","The Second Annual Think Tank on Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young: Developing a rational, reliable, and sustainable national health care resource.

"BACKGROUND: Evidence used to guide the current Institute of Medicine (IOM) gestational weight gain (GWG) recommendations is largely derived from studies of European descent, and as such the guidelines are the same for all races and ethnicities. The guidelines are also the same for prepregnancy obesity classes I through III. OBJECTIVE: Considering these literature gaps, we aim to (1) determine the association between the IOM GWG guidelines and three common pregnancy complications: preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and cesarean delivery in a racially and ethnically diverse population; and (2) assess whether the association between GWG and pregnancy complications differs by race/ethnicity or prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) categories, particularly obesity classes I through III. METHODS: To address these aims, we analyzed data from the Boston Birth Cohort. We calculated GWG using data from electronic medical records or, when missing, from a postdelivery questionnaire. We examined GWG continuously and categorically using the IOM formula. RESULTS: Of the 5,568 women included, 54.5% met the IOM criterion for excessive GWG. Compared to women who had adequate GWG, women who gained excessive weight had 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-2.14) times greater odds of preeclampsia; 1.68 (95% CI 1.15-2.46) times greater odds of gestational diabetes; and no significant change in odds of cesarean delivery (odds ratio [OR] = 1.14, 95% CI 0.99-1.31). Associations did not differ by race, ethnicity, or prepregnancy BMI categories including comparisons of obesity class I versus II or III (all p-values for interaction >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this racially and ethnically diverse population, excessive GWG was associated with higher odds of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and nonsignificantly, with cesarean delivery. Associations did not differ appreciably by race, ethnicity, or prepregnancy BMI categories. Our results support the relevance of the IOM GWG recommendations in racially and ethnically diverse populations, and in women in the higher prepregnancy obesity classes.","Gestational Weight Gain and Pregnancy Complications in a High-Risk, Racially and Ethnically Diverse Population."
"BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic-related weight gain is a common clinically relevant side effect when treating psychotic disorders in pediatric populations, yet few predictors and no moderators of antipsychotic-related weight gain are known. METHODS: The Treatment of Early-Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (TEOSS) study randomized 119 youths (age 8-19 years) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to 8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment with molindone, risperidone, or olanzapine and assessed treatment response and side effects. In this secondary analysis, we used multivariable linear regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis to investigate predictors and moderators of weight change and percent weight change from baseline to week 8. RESULTS: Treatment assignment was the most discriminant predictor of weight change [F(2, 66) = 17.00, p < 0.001] and percent weight change [F(2, 66) = 16.85, p < 0.001]. Mean weight gain was 0.74 (standard deviation +/-3.51) kg for molindone, 4.13 +/- 3.79 kg for risperidone, and 7.29 +/- 3.44 kg for olanzapine. After adjusting for treatment assignment, lower pretreatment hemoglobin A1C (HgbA1C) predicted more weight gain [F(1, 55) = 4.71, p = 0.03]. Diagnosis (schizoaffective vs. schizophrenia) moderated weight change [F(2, 63) = 6.02, p = 0.004] and percent weight change [F(2, 63) = 5.26, p = 0.008] such that schizoaffective diagnosis predicted larger weight gain for youths in the risperidone treatment arm. Age, sex, family income, baseline weight, and symptoms neither predicted nor moderated weight change or percent weight change. CONCLUSION: We identified prognostic subgroups and novel risk factors for antipsychotic-related weight gain. We confirmed that antipsychotic choice is extremely important for predicting future weight gain. We also found that younger age did not predict greater weight gain, in contrast to prior studies. Our findings require replication in an independent sample because we did not adjust for multiple comparisons to minimize false negatives.

"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vision and vestibular-related deficits are common after concussion and are associated with prolonged recovery times, substantially impacting the quality of life for children. The utility of targeted vestibular rehabilitation for these deficits in children after concussion is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether active vestibular rehabilitation is associated with an improvement in visuovestibular signs and symptoms in children with concussion. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of children diagnosed with concussion and referred to vestibular rehabilitation between 2012 and 2014 was conducted. Patient-reported symptoms and visuovestibular performance measures were assessed in the medical practice and physical therapy settings. RESULTS: One hundred nine children were included in the study with a mean age of 11.8 (3.4) years. Among this group, 59 (54%) were male and 48 (44%) had a sports-related concussion. Children presented to a pediatric sports medicine office and physical therapy a median of 24 (interquartile range [IQR], 14-42) and 55 (IQR, 39-94) days after injury, respectively. Concussion symptoms decreased from a median of 9 (IQR, 5-13) symptoms at initial evaluation to a median of 0 (IQR, 0-2) symptoms at final assessment. Performance on all visuovestibular tasks improved significantly over the course of therapy except for near point of convergence. For the 45 children who completed the Balance Error Scoring System at both initial and final therapy visits, there was a significant improvement in mean level of performance (P < 0.0001). Characteristics between those who completed a full versus partial course of physical therapy were similar. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Vestibular rehabilitation in children with concussion is associated with improvement in symptoms as well as visuovestibular performance. This active intervention may benefit children with persistent symptoms after concussion. Future prospective studies are needed to determine the efficacy and optimal postinjury timing of vestibular rehabilitation.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A208).",Vestibular Rehabilitation Is Associated With Visuovestibular Improvement in Pediatric Concussion.
"The United States are amid an opioid overdose epidemic; we are challenged to provide non-addicting/non-pharmacological alternatives to assist in pain attenuation. There are proven strategies available to manage chronic pain effectively without opioids. Utilization review providers for insurance companies often ignore medicine based scientific peer-reviewed studies that warn against the chronic use of opioid medications, as well as the lack of evidence to support long-term use of opioids for pain. This paradigm must change if we are to indeed change the drug-embracing culture in American chronic pain management. A barrier to treatment is pushback on the part of insurance companies especially as it relates to fighting against pain relief alternatives compared to classical analgesic agents. Pain specialists in the U.S., are compelled to find alternative solutions to help pain victims without promoting unwanted tolerance to analgesics and subsequent biological induction of the ""addictive brain."" It is noteworthy that reward center of the brain plays a crucial role in the modulation of nociception, and that adaptations in dopaminergic circuitry may affect several sensory and affective components of chronic pain syndromes.

"INTRODUCTION & HYPOTHESIS: Previous studies have suggested that women with urinary incontinence have an altered urinary microbiome. We hypothesized that the microbiome in women with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) differed from controls and tested this hypothesis using bacterial gene sequencing techniques. METHODS: This multicenter study compared the urinary microbiome in women with MUI and similarly aged controls. Catheterized urine samples were obtained; v4-6 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced to identify bacteria. Bacterial predominance (> 50% of an individual's genera) was compared between MUI and controls. Bacterial sequences were categorized into ""community types"" using Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) methods. Generalized linear mixed models predicted MUI/control status based on clinical characteristics and community type. Post-hoc analyses were performed in women < 51 and >/= 51 years. Sample size estimates required 200 samples to detect a 20% difference in Lactobacillus predominance with P < 0.05. RESULTS: Of 212 samples, 97.6% were analyzed (123 MUI/84 controls, mean age 53 +/- 11 years). Overall Lactobacillus predominance did not differ between MUI and controls (45/123 = 36.6% vs. 36/84 = 42.9%, P = 0.36). DMM analyses revealed six community types; communities differed by age (P = 0.001). A High-Lactobacillus (89.2% Lactobacillus) community had a greater proportion of controls (19/84 = 22.6%, MUI 11/123 = 8.9%). Overall, bacterial community types did not differ in MUI and controls. However, post-hoc analysis of women < 51 years found that bacterial community types distinguished MUI from controls (P = 0.041); Moderate-Lactobacillus (aOR 7.78, CI 1.85-32.62) and Mixed (aOR 7.10, CI 1.32-38.10) community types were associated with MUI. Community types did not differentiate MUI and controls in women >/= 51 years (P = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Women with MUI and controls did not differ in overall Lactobacillus predominance. In younger women, urinary bacterial community types differentiated MUI from controls.",The urinary microbiome in women with mixed urinary incontinence compared to similarly aged controls.
"For centuries, patients afflicted with the peripheral nerve damaging disease, leprosy-sometimes referred to as Hansen's Disease-were excluded from society and harshly stigmatized. Such stigmatization often stemmed from the belief that the disease was a punishment by G-d for wrongdoing. Leprosy's origins remain rooted throughout various European countries; however, the disease established its presence in North America around the late 18th century. In particular, major port cities that experienced high volume trade, such as New Orleans, were most susceptible to infection. In response to the ensuing Louisiana leprosy endemic, various medical pioneers established the first hospital in America dedicated solely to the treatment of lepers, the Carville Leprosarium. The World Health Organization's treatment recommendation, multidrug therapy, is one of many lifesaving discoveries made at the facility located nearly 70 miles north of New Orleans. Since opening in 1894, the Carville Leprosarium has treated hundreds of Americans infected with Mycobacterium leprae, the disease-causing agent responsible for leprosy.",From isolation to prosperity: Rediscovering the Carville Leprosarium.
"Extensive sequencing efforts of cancer genomes such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have been undertaken to uncover bona fide cancer driver genes which has enhanced our understanding of cancer and revealed therapeutic targets. However, the number of driver gene mutations is bounded, indicating that there must be a point when further sequencing efforts will be excessive. We found that there was a significant positive correlation between sample size and identified driver gene mutations across 33 cancers sequenced by the TCGA, which is expected if additional sequencing is still leading to the identification of more driver genes. However, the rate of new cancer driver genes being discovered with larger samples is declining rapidly. Our analysis provides a general guide for determining which cancer types would likely benefit from additional sequencing efforts, particularly those with relatively high rates of cancer driver gene discovery. Our results argue that past strategies of indiscriminately sequencing as many specimens as possible for all cancer types is becoming inefficient. In addition, without significant investments into applying our knowledge of cancer genomes, we risk sequencing more cancer genomes for the sake of sequencing rather than meaningful patient benefit.",Nearing saturation of cancer driver gene discovery.
"BACKGROUND: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention with daily tenofovir and emtricitabine is effective when taken consistently. Currently, there is no objective way to monitor PrEP adherence. Urine has been shown to be highly correlated with plasma tenofovir levels, with urine tenofovir levels >1000 ng/mL demonstrating recent (1-2 days) adherence to PrEP. SETTING: This study was conducted at an urban community health center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. METHODS: PrEP was administered to 50 young men who have sex with men and transgender women of color using weekly, biweekly, and/or monthly dispensation schedules. Primary objectives were retention at 48 weeks (in care at week 48 and completing >/=50% of medication pickups) and adherence assessed by urine tenofovir levels. Risk behaviors and sexually transmitted infection diagnoses were also collected. RESULTS: Seventy percent of participants were retained in care at 48 weeks. The proportion of subjects with urine tenofovir consistent with recent adherence was 80, 74.4, 82.4, 82.4, and 69.7% at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48, respectively. Sixty-one sexually transmitted infections were diagnosed over 231 screenings throughout 48 weeks, with no significant change between the first and second 24-week periods (P = 0.43; 0 seroconversions). At week 48, more than half of subjects reported an increase or no change in condom use, an increase in their ability to discuss HIV with partners, and no change in number of sexual partners from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate PrEP can be successfully delivered to a high-risk population with high program retention and medication adherence measured by urine tenofovir levels.",Delivery of TDF/FTC for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis to Prevent HIV-1 Acquisition in Young Adult Men Who Have Sex With Men and Transgender Women of Color Using a Urine Adherence Assay.
"Pedal access has become an indispensable technique for endovascular therapy of complex lower extremity peripheral vascular disease. From an option as a single access in a patient lacking traditional access approaches to a critical maneuver in combined antegrade-retrograde approaches during the treatment of complex chronic total occlusions, pedal access is an essential tool for any endovascular physician treating peripheral arterial disease. Anticipatory planning is critical in the successful utilization of pedal access. The appropriate tibiopedal vessel should be chosen and combined with the ideal access technique. Knowledge of the current medical devices available for pedal access and post-procedural hemostasis is key and can ease the learning curve. We present the evolution of pedal access with a review of the literature and technical tips to incorporate into everyday practice.",Tips for pedal access: technical evolution and review.
"The aim was to capture interdisciplinary expertise from a large group of clinicians, reflecting practice from across the UK and further, to inform subsequent development of a national consensus guidance for optimal management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). METHODS: Between September 2015 and October 2017, a specialist interest group including neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, nursing, primary care doctors and patient representatives met. An initial UK survey of attitudes and practice in IIH was sent to a wide group of physicians and surgeons who investigate and manage IIH regularly. A comprehensive systematic literature review was performed to assemble the foundations of the statements. An international panel along with four national professional bodies, namely the Association of British Neurologists, British Association for the Study of Headache, the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists critically reviewed the statements. RESULTS: Over 20 questions were constructed: one based on the diagnostic principles for optimal investigation of papilloedema and 21 for the management of IIH. Three main principles were identified: (1) to treat the underlying disease; (2) to protect the vision; and (3) to minimise the headache morbidity. Statements presented provide insight to uncertainties in IIH where research opportunities exist. CONCLUSIONS: In collaboration with many different specialists, professions and patient representatives, we have developed guidance statements for the investigation and management of adult IIH.",Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management.
"The interplay between the immune system and behaviour is of increasing interest in psychiatry research. Specifically, accumulating data points to a link between inflammation and psychopathology, including affective symptomatology. We investigated the association between inflammation and affective polarity in psychiatric inpatients who were hospitalized due to an affective exacerbation. Data was collected retrospectively and comparisons were made between manic and depressed patients. C-reactive protein (CRP), a general laboratory marker of immune activation and inflammation, was used as a non-specific inflammatory biomarker. Age, smoking and body mass index were considered covariates. Manic polarity (n = 89) was associated with statistically significant elevated CRP levels compared to depressed polarity (n = 44, 56%; p = 0.036), after controlling for covariates. No differences were observed in CRP levels across Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV Edition-Text Revised psychiatric diagnoses. These findings suggest a transdiagnostic association between inflammation and manic polarity in affective inpatients.",Association between Elevated C-Reactive Protein and Manic Polarity in Acute Psychiatric Inpatients with Affective Symptomatology.
"BACKGROUND: Trachomatous trichiasis is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness worldwide. A relatively simple surgery can spare vision. Although this surgery is usually performed free of charge in endemic regions, multiple studies indicate that surgical refusal is common. Prior studies have attempted to examine these reasons, although they generally rely on patient recall months to years after the surgery was offered. This study set out to determine major decision-making factors at the time of refusal. In addition, this study looked for ways to help increase surgical uptake by targeting modifiable factors. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a combination of focus groups, interviews with community health workers, and individual interviews with trichiasis patients who refused surgery to understand their decision-making. We found that several factors influenced surgical refusals, including misconception regarding recovery time, inability to find a post-surgical caregiver, and the time of year of the surgical campaign. Fear of the surgery itself played a minimal role in refusals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Trichiasis patients refuse surgery for many reasons, but a large percentage is due to lack of information and education, and is, therefore, modifiable within the structure of a surgical outreach project. To address this, we developed a ""frequently asked questions"" (FAQ) document aimed at community health workers, which may have helped to decrease some of the misconceptions that had led to prior refusals.","Why do patients refuse trichiasis surgery?

"BACKGROUND: Pediatricians following clinical practice guidelines for tobacco intervention (&ldquo;Ask, Advise, and Refer&rdquo; [AAR]) can motivate parents to reduce child tobacco smoke exposure (TSE). However, brief clinic interventions are unable to provide the more intensive, evidence-based behavioral treatments that facilitate the knowledge, skills, and confidence that parents need to both reduce child TSE and quit smoking. We hypothesized that a multilevel treatment model integrating pediatric clinic-level AAR with individual-level, telephone counseling would promote greater long-term (12-month) child TSE reduction and parent smoking cessation than clinic-level AAR alone. METHODS: Pediatricians were trained to implement AAR with parents during clinic visits and reminded via prompts embedded in electronic health records. Following AAR, parents were randomized to intervention (AAR + counseling) or nutrition education attention control (AAR + control). Child TSE and parent quit status were bioverified. RESULTS: Participants (n = 327) were 83% female, 83% African American, and 79% below the poverty level. Child TSE (urine cotinine) declined significantly in both conditions from baseline to 12 months (p = 0.001), with no between-group differences. The intervention had a statistically significant effect on 12-month bioverified quit status (p = 0.029): those in the intervention group were 2.47 times more likely to quit smoking than those in the control. Child age was negatively associated with 12-month log-cotinine (p = 0.01), whereas nicotine dependence was positively associated with 12-month log-cotinine levels (p = 0.001) and negatively associated with bioverified quit status (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatrician advice alone may be sufficient to increase parent protections of children from TSE. Integrating clinic-level intervention with more intensive individual-level smoking intervention is necessary to promote parent cessation.",Kids Safe and Smokefree (KiSS) Multilevel Intervention to Reduce Child Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Long-Term Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.
"Background C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is a life-threatening kidney disease caused by dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement (AP) activation. No approved specific therapy is available for C3G, although an anti-C5 mAb has been used off-label in some patients with C3G, with mixed results. Thus, there is an unmet medical need to develop other inhibitors of complement for C3G.Methods We used a murine model of lethal C3G to test the potential efficacy of an Fc fusion protein of complement receptor of the Ig superfamily (CRIg-Fc) in the treatment of C3G. CRIg-Fc binds C3b and inhibits C3 and C5 convertases of the AP. Mice with mutations in the factor H and properdin genes (FH(m/m)P(-/-)) develop early-onset C3G, with AP consumption, high proteinuria, and lethal crescentic GN.Results Treatment of FH(m/m)P(-/-) mice with CRIg-Fc, but not a control IgG, inhibited AP activation and diminished the consumption of plasma C3, factor B, and C5. CRIg-Fc-treated FH(m/m)P(-/-) mice also had significantly improved survival and reduced proteinuria, hematuria, BUN, glomerular C3 fragment, C9 and fibrin deposition, and GN pathology scores.Conclusions Therapeutics developed on the basis of the mechanism of action of soluble CRIg may be effective for the treatment of C3G and should be explored clinically.",Prevention of Fatal C3 Glomerulopathy by Recombinant Complement Receptor of the Ig Superfamily.
"OBJECTIVES: Activity of daily living stages and instrumental activity of daily living stages demonstrated ordered associations with mortality, risk of hospitalization, and receipt of recommended care. This article explores the associations of stages with the following three dimensions of patient activation: self-care efficacy, patient-doctor communication, and health-information seeking. We hypothesized that higher activity of daily living and instrumental activity of daily living stages (greater limitation) are associated with a lower level of patient activation. METHODS: Patient activation factors were derived from the 2004 and 2009 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. In this cross-sectional study (N = 8981), the associations of activity limitation stages with patient activation factors were assessed in latent factor models. RESULTS: Greater activity limitation was in general inversely associated with self-efficacy, patient-doctor communication, and health information seeking, even after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. For instance, the mean of self-care efficacy across activity of daily living stages I-IV (mild, moderate, severe, and complete limitation) compared with stage 0 (no limitation) decreased significantly by 0.17, 0.29, 0.34, and 0.60, respectively.

"Background and objective: The Penn Facial Pain Scale (Penn-FPS) was originally developed as a supplemental module to the Brief Pain Inventory Pain Interference Index (BPI-PII) in order to fully assess the impact of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) pain on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The current objective is to create and establish the content validity of a new stand-alone version of the measure, the Penn-FPS-Revised (Penn-FPS-R). Methods: Twenty participants (15 USA and 5 UK) with confirmed TN engaged in concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing interviews. These semi-structured interviews allowed participants to spontaneously describe the ways in which TN impacts on HRQoL and report on the extent to which the Penn-FPS and BPI-PII measure concepts are most relevant to them. Participants were also asked to report on the suitability of the instructions, recall period, and response options. Results: Concept elicitation revealed nine themes involving TN restrictions on daily activities and HRQoL, including: ""talking,"" ""self-care,"" ""eating,"" ""eating hard foods/chewing foods,"" ""daily activities,"" ""activities with temperature change,"" ""touching,"" ""mood,"" and ""relationships."" Cognitive debriefing confirmed that all of the Penn-FPS concepts and some of the BPI-PII concepts (""mood,"" ""general activities,"" and ""relations with others"") were relevant, although some items required edits to better capture individuals' experiences. The impact of temperature and/or weather on activities was also identified as an important concept that is not captured by the Penn-FPS or BPI-PII. Participants confirmed the acceptability of recall period, instructions, and response options. Results from the interviews were applied to create the Penn-FPS-R, a new brief outcome measure that assesses the impacts of TN most important to patients. Conclusion: The Penn-FPS-R is a new 12-item HRQoL outcome measure with content validity that can be used to assess and monitor the impact of TN treatment interventions in both clinical practice and research.",Measuring the impact of trigeminal neuralgia pain: the Penn Facial Pain Scale-Revised.
"We evaluated the safety and activity of autologous T cells expressing NY-ESO-1(c259), an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizing an HLA-A2-restricted NY-ESO-1/LAGE1a-derived peptide, in patients with metastatic synovial sarcoma (NY-ESO-1(c259)T cells). Confirmed antitumor responses occurred in 50% of patients (6/12) and were characterized by tumor shrinkage over several months. Circulating NY-ESO-1(c259)T cells were present postinfusion in all patients and persisted for at least 6 months in all responders. Most of the infused NY-ESO-1(c259)T cells exhibited an effector memory phenotype following ex vivo expansion, but the persisting pools comprised largely central memory and stem-cell memory subsets, which remained polyfunctional and showed no evidence of T-cell exhaustion despite persistent tumor burdens. Next-generation sequencing of endogenous TCRs in CD8(+) NY-ESO-1(c259)T cells revealed clonal diversity without contraction over time. These data suggest that regenerative pools of NY-ESO-1(c259)T cells produced a continuing supply of effector cells to mediate sustained, clinically meaningful antitumor effects.Significance: Metastatic synovial sarcoma is incurable with standard therapy.

"Purpose The Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) produced an evidence-based guideline on use of integrative therapies during and after breast cancer treatment that was determined to be relevant to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) membership. ASCO considered the guideline for endorsement. Methods The SIO guideline addressed the use of integrative therapies for the management of symptoms and adverse effects, such as anxiety and stress, mood disorders, fatigue, quality of life, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, lymphedema, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, pain, and sleep disturbance. Interventions of interest included mind and body practices, natural products, and lifestyle modifications. SIO systematic reviews focused on randomized controlled trials that were published from 1990 through 2015. The SIO guideline was reviewed by ASCO content experts for clinical accuracy and by ASCO methodologists for developmental rigor. On favorable review, an ASCO Expert Panel was convened to review the guideline contents and recommendations. Results The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the recommendations in the SIO guideline-published in 2017-are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the guideline with a few added discussion points. Recommendations Key recommendations include the following: Music therapy, meditation, stress management, and yoga are recommended for anxiety/stress reduction. Meditation, relaxation, yoga, massage, and music therapy are recommended for depression/mood disorders. Meditation and yoga are recommended to improve quality of life. Acupressure and acupuncture are recommended for reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Acetyl-l-carnitine is not recommended to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy because of a possibility of harm. No strong evidence supports the use of ingested dietary supplements to manage breast cancer treatment-related adverse effects.

"The transcription factor GATA6 has been shown to be important for lung development and branching morphogenesis in mouse models, but its role in human lung development is largely unknown. Here, we studied the role of GATA6 during lung differentiation using human pluripotent stem cells. We found that the human stem cell lines most efficient at generating NKX2.1+ lung progenitors express lower endogenous levels of GATA6 during endoderm patterning and that knockdown of GATA6 during endoderm patterning increased the generation of these cells. Complete ablation of GATA6 resulted in the generation of lung progenitors displaying increased cell proliferation with up to a 15-fold expansion compared with control cells, whereas the null cell line displayed a defect in further development into mature lung cell types. Furthermore, transgenic expression of GATA6 at the endoderm anteriorization stage skewed development toward a liver fate at the expense of lung progenitors. Our results suggest a critical dosage effect of GATA6 during human endoderm patterning and a later requirement during terminal lung differentiation. These studies offer an approach of modulating GATA6 expression to enhance the production of lung progenitors from human stem cell sources.",GATA6 suppression enhances lung specification from human pluripotent stem cells.
"The perineuronal net (PN), a highly organized extracellular matrix structure, is believed to play an important role in synaptic function, including maturation and stabilization. In addition to its role in restricting plasticity, alterations in the PN are implicated in disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. However, the time course of PN development is not known in humans. Therefore we set out to document the developmental timeline of the PN formation in humans in 14 frontal and hippocampal specimens from donors aged 27days to 31years old. Using immunohistochemistry and western blotting, we demonstrate that the PN begins to form as early as the second month of life but does not reach its robust, mature appearance until around 8years of age, though aggrecan cleavage products are observed prior to this. A similar developmental time course was observed in specimens from epilepsy patients. Our data suggest that aggrecan is present early in development but the structured PN develops throughout early childhood, similar to what has been observed in rodents. This timeline provides information for future pathological studies on the role of the PN in disease and an additional parallel between human and rodent development.",Normal Development of the Perineuronal Net in Humans; In Patients with and without Epilepsy.
"Although smart infusion pumps are intended to prevent medication errors by alerting users about doses that exceed set thresholds, a large number of clinically insignificant alarms and alerts create the potential for alert and alarm fatigue. We searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases for peer-reviewed literature (January 1, 2004-August 31, 2017) on managing smart pump alerts, alarms, and related fatigue. Twenty-nine articles that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed and organized into themes. Smart pumps give users two types of signals: alarms that indicate mechanical issues such as occlusion, air in the line, or low battery; and clinical alerts that indicate that a programmed dose exceeds a predefined safety limit. Mechanical alarms occur with greater frequency than clinical alerts, but alarms and alerts vary widely by pump model, patient population, time of day, month, and type of drug. Several causes of clinically insignificant alerts and alarms may be actionable, and strategies proposed in the literature include development of a multidisciplinary team to oversee the quality improvement effort with involvement of end users, standardization of medication administration practices, widening of drug limit library thresholds when clinically appropriate, maintaining up-to-date drug limit libraries, and interoperability. Whereas many strategies have been proposed, and case studies have been reported, none have been rigorously evaluated. In addition, more research is needed related to managing occlusion and air-in-line alarms, especially for complicated infusions. Future work should focus on the evaluation of specific and replicable alert and alarm reduction strategies with a greater emphasis on quantitative metrics.",Strategies for Managing Smart Pump Alarm and Alert Fatigue: A Narrative Review.
"Despite the identification of MYCN amplification as an adverse prognostic marker in neuroblastoma, MYCN inhibitors have yet to be developed. Here, by integrating evidence from a whole-genome shRNA library screen and the computational inference of master regulator proteins, we identify transcription factor activating protein 4 (TFAP4) as a critical effector of MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma, providing a novel synthetic lethal target. We demonstrate that TFAP4 is a direct target of MYCN in neuroblastoma cells, and that its expression and activity strongly negatively correlate with neuroblastoma patient survival. Silencing TFAP4 selectively inhibits MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, silencing TFAP4 induces neuroblastoma differentiation, as evidenced by increased neurite outgrowth and upregulation of neuronal markers. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TFAP4 is a key regulator of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and may represent a valuable novel therapeutic target.",Transcription factor activating protein 4 is synthetically lethal and a master regulator of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.
"Autoimmune encephalitis are a new category of inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system mediated by antibodies that attack neurotransmitter or protein receptors on the surface of neurons. The clinical syndromes are complex and are associated with manifestations that vary according to the type of antibody that is associated. The autoimmune response can start due to the presence of a tumour or viral infection, but in many case the cause remains unknown. In paediatrics, the most frequent autoimmune encephalitis is that associated with NMDA glutamate receptor antibodies (or anti-NMDA encephalitis). In children and teenagers, the initial symptoms are usually different from those of adults and the disease is rarely associated with tumours. In this article, in addition to anti-NMDA encephalitis, the general aspects of autoimmune encephalitis are reviewed and the most common questions asked about treatment of these diseases are addressed.",[Autoimmune encephalitis].

"Economic pressure has led the evolution of the role of the medical school dean from a clinician educator to a health care system executive. In addition, other dynamic requirements also have likely led to changes in their leadership characteristics. The most important relationship a dean has is with the chairs, yet in the context of the dean's changing role, little attention has been paid to this relationship. To frame this discussion, we asked medical school chairs what characteristics of a dean's leadership were most beneficial. We distributed a 26-question survey to 885 clinical and basic science chairs at 41 medical schools. These chairs were confidentially surveyed on their views of six leadership areas: evaluation, barriers to productivity, communication, accountability, crisis management, and organizational values. Of the 491 chairs who responded (response rate =55%), 88% thought that their dean was effective at leading the organization, and 89% enjoyed working with their dean. Chairs indicated that the most important area of expertise of a dean is to define a strategic vision, and the most important value for a dean is integrity between words and deeds. Explaining the reasons behind decisions, providing good feedback, admitting errors, open discussion of complex or awkward topics, and skill in improving relations with the teaching hospital were judged as desirable attributes of a dean. Interestingly, only 23% of chairs want to be a dean in the future. Financial acumen was the least important skill a chair thought a dean should hold, which is in contrast to the skill set for which many deans are hired and evaluated. After reviewing the literature and analyzing these responses, we assert that medical school chairs want their dean to maintain more traditional leadership than that needed by a health care system executive, such as articulating a vision for the future and keeping their promises. Thus, there appears to be a mismatch between what medical school chairs perceive they need from their dean and how the success of a dean is evaluated.",What a medical school chair wants from the dean.
"Host recognition of viral nucleic acids generated during infection leads to the activation of innate immune responses essential for early control of virus. Retrovirus reverse transcription creates numerous potential ligands for cytosolic host sensors that recognize foreign nucleic acids, including single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), RNA/DNA hybrids, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). We and others recently showed that the sensors cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41), and members of the Aim2-like receptor (ALR) family participate in the recognition of retroviral reverse transcripts. However, why multiple sensors might be required and their relative importance in in vivo control of retroviral infection are not known. Here, we show that DDX41 primarily senses the DNA/RNA hybrid generated at the first step of reverse transcription, while cGAS recognizes dsDNA generated at the next step. We also show that both DDX41 and cGAS are needed for the antiretroviral innate immune response to murine leukemia virus (MLV) and HIV in primary mouse macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Using mice with cell type-specific knockout of the Ddx41 gene, we show that DDX41 sensing in DCs but not macrophages was critical for controlling in vivo MLV infection. This suggests that DCs are essential in vivo targets for infection, as well as for initiating the antiviral response. Our work demonstrates that the innate immune response to retrovirus infection depends on multiple host nucleic acid sensors that recognize different reverse transcription intermediates.IMPORTANCE Viruses are detected by many different host sensors of nucleic acid, which in turn trigger innate immune responses, such as type I interferon (IFN) production, required to control infection. We show here that at least two sensors are needed to initiate a highly effective innate immune response to retroviruses-DDX41, which preferentially senses the RNA/DNA hybrid generated at the first step of retrovirus replication, and cGAS, which recognizes double-stranded DNA generated at the second step. Importantly, we demonstrate using mice lacking DDX41 or cGAS that both sensors are needed for the full antiviral response needed to control in vivo MLV infection. These findings underscore the need for multiple host factors to counteract retroviral infection.",DDX41 Recognizes RNA/DNA Retroviral Reverse Transcripts and Is Critical for In Vivo Control of Murine Leukemia Virus Infection.
"In the 1950s, researchers devoted very little time to understanding breastfeeding, physicians and nurses learned almost nothing about it in their training, and even those mothers who showed an interest in breastfeeding often found the lack of information and support for doing so to be overwhelming. In this period, Niles R. Newton stands out for a number of reasons. Born in 1923, Niles went on to marry, have four children (all of whom she breastfed), earn a master's degree and a PhD, and carry on a successful research career as a specialist in the psychology of childbirth, breastfeeding, and childrearing. Her unique work in the psychology and physiology of breastfeeding shed precious light on many of the most common problems that mothers faced when they set out to breastfeed their infants. Her research quickly became the cornerstone of the back-to-the-breast movement and was snapped up by breastfeeding advocates, mothers, and La Leche League, in particular, who helped popularize and disseminate Newton's ideas to an eager audience. This article examines Newton's life and works in more detail and argues for the central place she holds in the history of modern breastfeeding.","The Life and Legacy of Niles Polk Rumely Newton: Breastfeeding Researcher, Advocate, and Mother, 1923-1993."
"BACKGROUND: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-inflammatory vascular disease that in children unlike in adults shows no sex predilection. FMD is often underdiagnosed, and its pathophysiology is unclear. Delayed diagnosis may lead to refractory hypertension and decreases the chance of successful treatment. Doppler ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and catheter-based angiography (angiography) are currently used to help make a clinicoradiological diagnosis of FMD. The main aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of imaging modalities which can allow for earlier and improved detection. Furthermore, an anatomical mapping of the location of lesions can help determine the best treatment modalities. METHODS: All patients with non-syndromic non-inflammatory renovascular hypertension were recruited from the Nephrology Department at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and enrolled in the U.S. FMD Registry maintained at the University of Michigan. Clinical presentation and imaging findings on US, CT, and MRI of children diagnosed with FMD were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 7 +/- 4.9 years (4 months-17 years). Family history of hypertension (HTN) (52%), FMD (8.7%), Caucasian (60%), headache (48%), and HTN (80%) were the most prevalent symptom and sign at presentation. Bruits were 100% specific for renal artery stenosis (RAS) diagnosis but were heard in the minority of patients (3 patients, 12%). FMD was mainly unifocal within a single site (68%) or multiple sites (28%) and involved the main or first order renal branch in about 68% of children. Isolated distal lesions beyond the second order branches were found in about 25% of children. US imaging was significantly less sensitive than angiography (28%, p = 0.003). MRA had a better sensitivity (62.5%, p = 0.3) than US. Overall, CTA had the best sensitivity (84.2%, p = 0.4) compared to angiography; however, only angiography showed distal vessel disease. CONCLUSIONS: Limitations of the study include the sample size and biases-only patients diagnosed with FMD were included in this study and most patients were referred to a pediatric nephrologist for unexplained hypertension. Angiography should be performed as part of the initial work-up of any child suspected of having renovascular FMD, regardless of the findings seen on US, MRA, or CTA.",Imaging studies in pediatric fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD): a single-center experience.
"Background and objectives: Studies that examined geographic variation in heart failure (HF) and its association with risk factors at county and state levels were limited. This study aimed to test a hypothesis that HF mortality is disproportionately distributed across the United States, and this variation is significantly associated with the county- and state-level prevalence of high blood pressure (HBP), diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. Methods: Data from 1,723 counties in 51 states (including District of Columbia as a state) on the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity, physical inactivity, HBP and diabetes in 2010, and age-adjusted HF mortality in 2013-2015 are examined. Geographic variations in risk factors and HF mortality are analyzed using spatial autocorrelation analysis and mapped using Geographic Information System techniques. The associations between county-level HF mortality and risk factors (level 1) are examined using multilevel hierarchical regression models, taking into consideration of their variations accounted for by states (level 2). Results: There are significant variations in HF mortality, ranging from the lowest 11.7 (the state of Vermont) to highest 85.0 (Mississippi) per 100,000 population among the 51 states. Age-adjusted prevalence of obesity, physical inactivity, HBP, and diabetes are positively and significantly associated with HF mortality. Multilevel analysis indicates that county-level HF mortality rates remain significantly associated with diabetes (beta = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.7-3.7, p < 0.0001), HBP (beta = 3.6, 2.1-5.0, p < 0.0001), obesity (beta = 0.9, 0.6-1.3, p < 0.0001), and physical inactivity (beta = 1.2, 0.8-1.5, p < 0.0001) after controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, and poverty index. After further controlling obesity and physical inactivity in diabetes and HBP models, the effects of diabetes (beta = 1.0, -0.3 to 2.3, p = 0.12) and HBP (beta = 2.4, 0.9-3.9, p = 0.003) on HF mortality had a considerable reduction. Conclusion: HF mortality disproportionately affects the counties and states across the nation. The geographic variations in HF morality are significantly explained by the variations in the prevalence of obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, and HBP.","Geographic Variation in Heart Failure Mortality and Its Association With Hypertension, Diabetes, and Behavioral-Related Risk Factors in 1,723 Counties of the United States."
"BACKGROUND: The pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC) reliably predicts a low probability of PE in adults. We examine the diagnostic accuracy of the objective components of the PERC rule in children previously tested for PE. METHODS: Children aged 5-17 who had a D-dimer or pulmonary vascular imaging ordered from 2004 to 2014 in a large multicenter hospital network were identified by query of administrative databases. Using explicit, predefined methods, trained abstracters selected charts of children clearly tested for PE, collected the 8 objective variables for PERC, and determined PE criterion standard status (image or autopsy confirmed PE or deep vein thrombosis within 30days by query of the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC)). RESULTS: We identified 543 patients, including 56 (10.3%, 95% CI: 7.8-13.1%) who were PE+, with a mean and median age of 15years. All 8 objective criteria from PERC were negative in 170 patients (31%), including one with PE (false negative rate 0.6%, 0-3.2%). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 98.2% (90.5-100%), and 34.7 (30.5-39.1%), respectively, leading to a likelihood ratio negative=0.05 (0.1-0.27). When treated as a diagnostic test based upon sum of criteria positive, PERC had good discrimination between PE+ vs PE- with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.81 (0.75-0.86). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of children and teenagers with suspected PE, the PERC rule was negative in 31%, and demonstrated good overall diagnostic accuracy, including a low false negative rate. These data support the need for a large, prospective diagnostic validation study of PERC in children.",Evaluation of the pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC rule) in children evaluated for suspected pulmonary embolism.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is increasingly recognized as a complication affecting recovery from concussion. Individuals with POTS demonstrate refractory dizziness, lightheadedness, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, headache, chronic pain, nausea and gastrointestinal dysmotility, activity and exercise intolerance, syncope, and tachycardia. Subtypes of POTS may include hypovolemia, hyperadrenergic states, autonomic neuropathy, and underlying autoimmunity, which may variably impact response to rehabilitation in varying ways. The subtle presentation of POTS postconcussion is often mistaken for underlying anxiety, conversion disorder, or lack of motivation for recovery. This article will present clinical features of POTS that may arise after concussion, and propose a role for physical therapists in the diagnosis and management of POTS during concussion recovery. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: Data recorded and entered into a database during clinic visits from a large pediatric institution indicate that 11.4% of individuals diagnosed with POTS report onset of symptoms within 3 months of sustaining a concussion. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system can result in lightheadedness, shortness of breath, chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations on standing or with exertion, and activity and exercise intolerance. Identified comorbidities in people with POTS such as joint hypermobility and autoimmune disorders can further influence recovery. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Physical therapists may identify signs and symptoms of POTS in a subset of individuals who remain refractory to typical interventions and who exhibit symptom exacerbation with orthostatic activity. Incorporation of an individualized POTS exercise program into current established concussion interventions may be useful, with emphasis on initial recumbent exercises and ongoing physical therapy assessment of exercise tolerance for dosing of activity intensity and duration.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A211).",Activity and Exercise Intolerance After Concussion: Identification and Management of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.

"Vision impairment is a significant global health concern. Still, there remains a gap in our knowledge of visual health in refugees. We conducted a systematic review of the distinctive eye care needs of refugees. We screened PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science through February 17, 2017 for studies that focused primarily on visual health in refugees. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tools. 26 studies were included in the final review. The prevalence of blindness ranged from 1.3 to 26.2%. Trachoma was the leading infectious cause. Only four studies assessed vision-related care. Time/location of displacement, social unrest, and sanitation impacted severity of eye disease. Refugees have unique eye care needs. Public health interventions should target eye care at every stage of displacement.

"Background: The World Health Organization's 2020 goals for Chagas disease are (1) interrupting vector-borne intradomiciliary transmission and (2) having all infected people under care in endemic countries. Insecticide spraying has proved efficacious for reaching the first goal, but active transmission remains in several regions. For the second, treatment has mostly been restricted to recently infected patients, who comprise only a small proportion of all infected individuals. Methods: We extended our previous dynamic transmission model to simulate a domestic Chagas disease transmission cycle and examined the effects of both vector control and etiological treatment on achieving the operational criterion proposed by the Pan American Health Organization for intradomiciliary, vectorial transmission interruption (ie, <2% seroprevalence in children <5 years of age). Results: Depending on endemicity, an antivectorial intervention that decreases vector density by 90% annually would achieve the transmission interruption criterion in 2-3 years (low endemicity) to >30 years (high endemicity). When this strategy is combined with annual etiological treatment in 10% of the infected human population, the seroprevalence criterion would be achieved, respectively, in 1 and 11 years. Conclusions: Combining highly effective vector control with etiological (trypanocidal) treatment in humans would substantially reduce time to transmission interruption as well as infection incidence and prevalence. However, the success of vector control may depend on prevailing vector species. It will be crucial to improve the coverage of screening programs, the performance of diagnostic tests, the proportion of people treated, and the efficacy of trypanocidal drugs. While screening and access can be incremented as part of strengthening the health systems response, improving diagnostics performance and drug efficacy will require further research.",Complementary Paths to Chagas Disease Elimination: The Impact of Combining Vector Control With Etiological Treatment.

"As rhinoplasty procedures become more common, the need for revision surgeries increases as well. Unlike primary rhinoplasties, revision rhinoplasties can be more challenging because of anatomic differences from initial surgery, a lack of available cartilage, tissue remodeling responses, and other complications. As such, surgeons should be prepared to address revision rhinoplasty patients differently from primary rhinoplasty patients. Here, the authors describe a generalizable approach to revision functional rhinoplasty patients and detail some of the surgical techniques that can be employed to achieve optimal outcomes, with particular attention paid to procedures that can be used in the middle vault.",Functional Compromise in the Middle Vault in the Management of Revision Rhinoplasty.
"The role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in HIV-related atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unclear. Both glycation and oxidation (HDLox) are major modifications of HDL that can alter its composition and function. Therefore, we explored the longitudinal association of HDLox with progression of glycation, as evaluated by measurement of circulating forms of receptor for AGE that predict morbidity (soluble Receptors for Advanced Glycation Endproducts [sRAGE], endogenous secretory Receptors for Advanced Glycation Endproducts [esRAGE]), in people with HIV-1 (PWH; HIV-1) and uninfected (HIV-1) individuals.We retrospectively assessed if levels of plasma sRAGE and esRAGE and HDL function (reduced antioxidant function is associated with increased HDL lipid hydroperoxide content; HDLox) in a subset of participants (n = 80) from a prospective 3-year study (AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5078). Primary outcomes were baseline and yearly rates of change over 96 of 144 weeks (Delta) in HDLox in HIV-1 versus uninfected HIV-1 controls (noted as HIV-1).Higher baseline levels of sRAGE in PWH on effective anti-retroviral therapy and with low CVD risk, but not in HIV-1 persons, were independently associated with higher HDLox. EsRAGE, but not sRAGE, had consistent inverse relationships with DeltaHDLox in both HIV-1 and HIV-1 persons at baseline. In HIV-1 but not in HIV-1 persons, DeltaHDLox had positive and inverse relationships with DeltaRAGE and DeltaesRAGE, respectively.Glycation and oxidation of HDL may contribute to impaired HDL function present in PWH.",Soluble levels of receptor for advanced glycation endproducts and dysfunctional high-density lipoprotein in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus: ACTG NWCS332.

"Background: It is known that dexmedetomidine can reduce opioid requirements and that there is a synergistic effect when dexmedetomidine and morphine (a full mu opioid receptor agonist) are administered together. However, it was unclear whether a synergistic or additive effect would be observed when dexmedetomidine was co-administered with a partial mu opioid receptor agonist. The present study was designed to elucidate such effects by intrathecally co-administering dexmedetomidine and dezocine, a partial mu receptor agonist, in a mouse pain model. Methods: C57 mice (N = 165) were randomly divided into 19 groups. The tail flick test was adopted to measure the antinociceptive effects of the tested agents. The mice were divided into saline and drug groups to investigate the dose-dependent analgesic effects. Each drug was administered at fixed doses alone and in combination with one of three doses of a second drug. Results: Dezocine (0.3125 - 1.25 mug) and dexmedetomidine (0.04 - 1 mug) both enhanced the tail withdrawal latency in dose-dependent fashions. Dexmedetomidine (0.04 - 1 mug) enhanced the analgesic effect of dezocine. Dezocine (0.3125 - 1.25 mug) enhanced the analgesic effect of dexmedetomidine. Compared with the individual drug effects, the combined effects of dezocine (0.625 mug) and dexmedetomidine (0.04 mug) were more potent 15 - 60 min after injection, but they remained similar to the sum of the effects of the two individual drugs. Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine and dezocine produce an additive analgesic effect on acute nociception when administered simultaneously.",Additive analgesic effect of dexmedetomidine and dezocine administered intrathecally in a mouse pain model.
"Heightened neural excitability in infancy and childhood results in increased susceptibility to seizures. Such early-life seizures are associated with language deficits and autism that can result from aberrant development of the auditory cortex. Here, we show that early-life seizures disrupt a critical period (CP) for tonotopic map plasticity in primary auditory cortex (A1). We show that this CP is characterized by a prevalence of ""silent,"" NMDA-receptor (NMDAR)-only, glutamate receptor synapses in auditory cortex that become ""unsilenced"" due to activity-dependent AMPA receptor (AMPAR) insertion. Induction of seizures prior to this CP occludes tonotopic map plasticity by prematurely unsilencing NMDAR-only synapses. Further, brief treatment with the AMPAR antagonist NBQX following seizures, prior to the CP, prevents synapse unsilencing and permits subsequent A1 plasticity. These findings reveal that early-life seizures modify CP regulators and suggest that therapeutic targets for early post-seizure treatment can rescue CP plasticity.",Early Seizures Prematurely Unsilence Auditory Synapses to Disrupt Thalamocortical Critical Period Plasticity.
"Purpose: Intranasally delivered ST266, the biological, proteinaceous secretome of amnion-derived multipotent progenitor cells, reduces retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss, optic nerve inflammation, and demyelination in experimental optic neuritis. This unique therapy and novel administration route delivers numerous cytokines and growth factors to the eye and optic nerve, suggesting a potential to also treat other optic neuropathies. Thus, ST266-mediated neuroprotection was examined following traumatic optic nerve injury. Methods: Optic nerve crush injury was surgically induced in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were treated daily with intranasal PBS or ST266. RGC function was assessed by optokinetic responses (OKRs), RGCs were counted, and optic nerve sections were stained with luxol fast blue and anti-neurofilament antibodies to assess myelin and RGC axon damage. Results: Intranasal ST266 administered daily for 5 days, beginning at the time that a 1-second optic nerve crush was performed, significantly attenuated OKR decreases. Furthermore, ST266 treatment reduced damage to RGC axons and myelin within optic nerves, and blocked RGC loss. Following a 4-second optic nerve crush, intranasal ST266 increased RGC survival and showed a trend toward reduced RGC axon and myelin damage. Ten days following optic nerve crush, ST266 prevented myelin damage, while also inducing a trend toward increased RGC survival and visual function. Conclusions: ST266 significantly attenuates traumatic optic neuropathy. Neuroprotective effects of this unique combination of biologic molecules observed here and previously in optic neuritis suggest potential broad application for preventing neuronal damage in multiple optic nerve disorders. Furthermore, results support intranasal delivery as a novel, noninvasive therapeutic modality for eyes and optic nerves.",RGC Neuroprotection Following Optic Nerve Trauma Mediated By Intranasal Delivery of Amnion Cell Secretome.
"Purpose: To provide a comprehensive overview of the molecular basis of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) in Spanish families. Thus, we established the molecular characterization rate, gene prevalence, and mutational spectrum in the largest European cohort reported to date. Methods: A total of 258 unrelated Spanish families with a clinical diagnosis of RP and suspected autosomal dominant inheritance were included. Clinical diagnosis was based on complete ophthalmologic examination and family history. Retrospective and prospective analysis of Spanish adRP families was carried out using a combined strategy consisting of classic genetic techniques and next-generation sequencing (NGS) for single-nucleotide variants and copy number variation (CNV) screening. Results: Overall, 60% of our families were genetically solved. Interestingly, 3.1% of the cohort carried pathogenic CNVs. Disease-causing variants were found in an autosomal dominant gene in 55% of the families; however, X-linked and autosomal recessive forms were also identified in 3% and 2%, respectively. Four genes (RHO, PRPF31, RP1, and PRPH2) explained up to 62% of the solved families. Missense changes were most frequently found in adRP-associated genes; however, CNVs represented a relevant disease cause in PRPF31- and CRX-associated forms. Conclusions: Implementation of NGS technologies in the adRP study clearly increased the diagnostic yield compared with classic approaches. Our study outcome expands the spectrum of disease-causing variants, provides accurate data on mutation gene prevalence, and highlights the implication of CNVs as important contributors to adRP etiology.",Toward the Mutational Landscape of Autosomal Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa: A Comprehensive Analysis of 258 Spanish Families.
"BACKGROUND: The pathway from evidence generation to consumption contains many steps which can lead to overstatement or misinformation. The proliferation of internet-based health news may encourage selection of media and academic research articles that overstate strength of causal inference. We investigated the state of causal inference in health research as it appears at the end of the pathway, at the point of social media consumption. METHODS: We screened the NewsWhip Insights database for the most shared media articles on Facebook and Twitter reporting about peer-reviewed academic studies associating an exposure with a health outcome in 2015, extracting the 50 most-shared academic articles and media articles covering them. We designed and utilized a review tool to systematically assess and summarize studies' strength of causal inference, including generalizability, potential confounders, and methods used. These were then compared with the strength of causal language used to describe results in both academic and media articles. Two randomly assigned independent reviewers and one arbitrating reviewer from a pool of 21 reviewers assessed each article. RESULTS: We accepted the most shared 64 media articles pertaining to 50 academic articles for review, representing 68% of Facebook and 45% of Twitter shares in 2015. Thirty-four percent of academic studies and 48% of media articles used language that reviewers considered too strong for their strength of causal inference. Seventy percent of academic studies were considered low or very low strength of inference, with only 6% considered high or very high strength of causal inference. The most severe issues with academic studies' causal inference were reported to be omitted confounding variables and generalizability. Fifty-eight percent of media articles were found to have inaccurately reported the question, results, intervention, or population of the academic study. CONCLUSIONS: We find a large disparity between the strength of language as presented to the research consumer and the underlying strength of causal inference among the studies most widely shared on social media. However, because this sample was designed to be representative of the articles selected and shared on social media, it is unlikely to be representative of all academic and media work. More research is needed to determine how academic institutions, media organizations, and social network sharing patterns impact causal inference and language as received by the research consumer.",Causal language and strength of inference in academic and media articles shared in social media (CLAIMS): A systematic review.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sedation for nonoperating room procedures is experiencing a considerable increase in demand. Respiratory compromise is one of the most common adverse events seen in sedation. Capnography is a modality that has been widely adopted in this area, but may not be well suited to the special demands of nonoperating room sedation. This review is an assessment of new technologies that may improve outcomes beyond those achievable with capnography. RECENT FINDINGS: New devices for detecting the onset of apnea and for assessing respiratory depression have emerged which have advantages over conventional capnography for detecting apnea without excessive false positive and false negative rates. In addition, monitors that assess respiratory drive have become available, and these may prove useful in regulating depth of sedation. SUMMARY: No single monitor is ideal for all settings. During brief endoscopic sedation, detection of apnea is paramount, while during longer procedures, avoiding excessive respiratory depression is more critical. The clinician must choose the appropriate monitor based on an understanding of the challenges of the particular environment.",Recent advances in respiratory monitory in nonoperating room anesthesia.

"The adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive (KATP) channels in pancreatic beta cells couple the blood glucose level to insulin secretion. KATP channels in pancreatic beta cells comprise the pore-forming Kir6.2 and the modulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits. Currently, there is no high-affinity and relatively specific inhibitor for the Kir6.2 pore. The importance of developing such inhibitors is twofold. First, in many cases, the lack of such an inhibitor precludes an unambiguous determination of the Kir6.2's role in certain physiological and pathological processes. This problem is exacerbated because Kir6.2 knockout mice do not yield the expected phenotypes of hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia, which in part, may reflect developmental adaptation. Second, mutations in Kir6.2 or SUR1 that increase the KATP current cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Many patients who have PNDM have been successfully treated with sulphonylureas, a common class of antidiabetic drugs that bind to SUR1 and indirectly inhibit Kir6.2, thereby promoting insulin secretion. However, some PNDM-causing mutations render KATP channels insensitive to sulphonylureas. Conceptually, because these mutations are located intracellularly, an inhibitor blocking the Kir6.2 pore from the extracellular side might provide another approach to this problem. Here, by screening the venoms from >200 animals against human Kir6.2 coexpressed with SUR1, we discovered a small protein of 54 residues (SpTx-1) that inhibits the KATP channel from the extracellular side. It inhibits the channel with a dissociation constant value of 15 nM in a relatively specific manner and with an apparent one-to-one stoichiometry. SpTx-1 evidently inhibits the channel by primarily targeting Kir6.2 rather than SUR1; it inhibits not only wild-type Kir6.2 coexpressed with SUR1 but also a Kir6.2 mutant expressed without SUR1. Importantly, SpTx-1 suppresses both sulfonylurea-sensitive and -insensitive, PNDM-causing Kir6.2 mutants. Thus, it will be a valuable tool to investigate the channel's physiological and biophysical properties and to test a new strategy for treating sulfonylurea-resistant PNDM.",A novel high-affinity inhibitor against the human ATP-sensitive Kir6.2 channel.
"Skeletal muscle comprises a family of diverse tissues with highly specialized functions. Many acquired diseases, including HIV and COPD, affect specific muscles while sparing others. Even monogenic muscular dystrophies selectively affect certain muscle groups. These observations suggest that factors intrinsic to muscle tissues influence their resistance to disease. Nevertheless, most studies have not addressed transcriptional diversity among skeletal muscles. Here we use RNAseq to profile mRNA expression in skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle tissues from mice and rats. Our data set, MuscleDB, reveals extensive transcriptional diversity, with greater than 50% of transcripts differentially expressed among skeletal muscle tissues. We detect mRNA expression of hundreds of putative myokines that may underlie the endocrine functions of skeletal muscle. We identify candidate genes that may drive tissue specialization, including Smarca4, Vegfa, and Myostatin. By demonstrating the intrinsic diversity of skeletal muscles, these data provide a resource for studying the mechanisms of tissue specialization.",Transcriptional profiling reveals extraordinary diversity among skeletal muscle tissues.

"Importance: Use of next-generation sequencing of RNA and machine learning algorithms can classify the risk of malignancy in cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules to limit unnecessary diagnostic surgery. Objective: To measure the performance of a genomic sequencing classifier for cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. Design, Setting, and Participants: A blinded validation study was conducted on a set of cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules collected by fine-needle aspiration biopsy between June 2009 and December 2010 from 49 academic and community centers in the United States. All patients underwent surgery without genomic information and were assigned a histopathology diagnosis by an expert panel blinded to all genomic information. There were 210 potentially eligible thyroid biopsy samples with Bethesda III or IV indeterminate cytopathology that constituted a cohort previously used to validate the gene expression classifier. Of these, 191 samples (91.0%) had adequate residual RNA for validation of the genomic sequencing classifier. Algorithm development and independent validation occurred between August 2016 and May 2017. Exposures: Thyroid nodule surgical histopathology diagnosis by an expert panel blinded to all genomic data. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was measurement of genomic sequencing classifier sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values in biopsies from Bethesda III and IV nodules. The secondary end point was measurement of classifier performance in biopsies from Bethesda II, V, and VI nodules. Results: Of the 183 included patients, 142 (77.6%) were women, and the mean (range) age was 51.7 (22.0-85.0) years. The genomic sequencing classifier had a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI, 79-98) and a specificity of 68% (95% CI, 60-76). At 24% cancer prevalence, the negative predictive value was 96% (95% CI, 90-99) and the positive predictive value was 47% (95% CI, 36-58). Conclusions and Relevance: The genomic sequencing classifier demonstrates high sensitivity and accuracy for identifying benign nodules. Its 36% increase in specificity compared with the gene expression classifier potentially increases the number of patients with benign nodules who can safely avoid unnecessary diagnostic surgery.",Performance of a Genomic Sequencing Classifier for the Preoperative Diagnosis of Cytologically Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules.
"A cardinal feature of the reaction to stress is the promotion of energy mobilization, enabling appropriate behavioural responses. Predator odours are naturalistic and ecologically relevant stressors present over evolutionary timescales. In this study, we asked whether maternal predator odour exposure could program long-term energy mobilization in C57BL/6 mice offspring. To test this hypothesis, we measured rates of oxygen consumption in prenatally predator odour exposed mice in adulthood while controlling for levels of locomotor activity at baseline and under stress. Circulating thyroid hormone levels and the transcript abundance of key regulators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis within the periventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and in the liver, including carriers and receptors and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, were measured as endocrine mediators facilitating energy availability. Prenatally predator odour exposed mice of both sexes mobilized more energy during lower energy demand periods of the day and under stressful conditions. Further, prenatally predator odour exposed mice displayed modifications of their hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis through increased circulating thyroxine and thyroid hormone receptor alpha within the PVN and decreased transthyretin in the liver. Overall, these results suggest that maternal exposure to predator odour is sufficient to increase long-term energy mobilization in adult offspring.",Maternal predator odour exposure programs metabolic responses in adult offspring.

"Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 2 (FHL2) is a cytokine storm syndrome characterized by immune hyperactivation with viral infection due to a CD8 T cell cytotoxic killing defect secondary to a perforin deficiency. As most studies of FHL2 mice have used pathogen naive animals, the effects of immune memory on FHL2 are understudied. We utilized an immunization model of the perforin-deficient mouse to study the effects of immune memory on FHL2. Prior CD8 T cell specific antigen exposure leads to enhanced HLH disease with increased morbidity and decreased time to mortality. Enhanced disease is associated with altered cytokine production and T cell proliferation. Response to IFNgamma blockade is reduced and TNFalpha gains a pathogenic role, while blockade of the IL-33 receptor ST2 remains effective. These results suggest that pre-existing immune memory may worsen outcome and alter treatment response for FHL2 patients who may not be naive to their immune triggers.",CD8 T Cell Memory Increases Immunopathology in the Perforin-Deficient Model of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Secondary to TNF-alpha.

": Background: Despite the known benefits of early postsurgical mobility, there are no clear recommendations on early mobility among uncomplicated postoperative neurosurgical spine patients. PURPOSE: The purpose of this quality improvement initiative was to establish an NP-led early mobility protocol to reduce uncomplicated postsurgical spine patients' length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and eliminate the variability of postsurgical care. A secondary objective was to educate and empower nursing staff to initiate the early mobility protocol independently and incorporate it in their practice to improve patient care. METHODS: Two neurosurgery NPs led an interprofessional team to develop the early mobility protocol. Team members provided preadmission preoperative education to communicate the necessity for early mobility and provide information about the protocol. New nursing guidelines called for patient mobility on the day of surgery, within six hours of arrival on the medical-surgical unit. Nurses were empowered to get patients out of bed independently, without a physical therapy consultation; they also removed urinary catheters and discontinued IV opioids when patients' status permitted. RESULTS: Over a one-year period, implementation of the protocol resulted in a nine-hour reduction in LOS per hospitalization in neurosurgical spine patients who underwent lumbar laminectomies. The protocol also allowed nurses more autonomy in patient care and was a catalyst for patient involvement in their postoperative mobility. Given the success of the protocol, it is being replicated by other surgical services throughout the organization. CONCLUSIONS: This low-cost, high-reward initiative aligns with the strategic plan of the organization and ensures that high-quality, patient-centered care remains the priority. NPs in other institutions can modify this protocol to promote postoperative mobility in their organizations.",The Benefits of Implementing an Early Mobility Protocol in Postoperative Neurosurgical Spine Patients.

"PURPOSE: HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (Y-GBMSM). Resilience remains understudied among Y-GBMSM living with HIV, but represents a potentially important framework for improving HIV-related outcomes in this population. We sought to explore cognitive and behavioral dimensions of resilience and their correlates among Y-GBMSM to gain insights to inform future interventions. METHODS: Our study sample consisted of 200 Y-GBMSM living with HIV enrolled in a multisite study of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN). Participants completed a one-time, self-administered structured questionnaire, including validated scales capturing a range of cognitive, behavioral, demographic, and psychosocial data. Utilizing these data, we examined cognitive and behavioral dimensions of resilience and their potential psychosocial correlates using linear regression modeling. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that education, stigma, social support, ethnic identity, internalized homonegativity, and behavioral resilience were statistically significant predictors of cognitive resilience (P < 0.001, R(2) = 0.678). Social support satisfaction and cognitive resilience were significant predictors of behavioral resilience (P < 0.001, R(2) = 0.141). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to potential strategies for incorporating resilience-promoting features into future interventions to support Y-GBMSM living with HIV. Specifically, strengths-based interventions in this population should seek to enhance social support, promote positive identity development, and encourage education. Future research can also seek to utilize and refine our measures of resilience among youth.",Cognitive and Behavioral Resilience Among Young Gay and Bisexual Men Living with HIV.
"The MYC oncogene is commonly altered across human cancers. Distinct from the normal MYC proto-oncogene, which is under tight transcriptional, translational, and post-translational control, deregulated oncogenic MYC drives imbalanced, non-linear amplification of transcription that results in oncogenic 'stress.' The term 'stress' had been a euphemism for our lack of mechanistic understanding, but synthesis of many studies over the past decade provides a more coherent picture of oncogenic MYC driving metastable cellular states, particularly altered metabolism, that activate and depend on cellular stress response pathways to allow for continued growth and survival. Both deregulated metabolism and these stress response pathways represent vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically.",MYC-induced metabolic stress and tumorigenesis.
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pediatric hospitalists are expected to be adept at effective teamwork; yet, studies in which researchers describe teamwork practices in general pediatric inpatient settings are lacking. Our aim in this study was to examine the roles that general pediatric team members assume in real-life settings and how team members conduct teamwork practices on family-centered rounds. METHODS: In the ethnographic tradition, we observed a general pediatric team on a hospitalist service, focusing on family-centered rounds, and conducted in-depth interviews with interns, senior residents, and faculty. We collected data in the form of field notes from observations and transcribed interviews and used constant comparison methods to create codes and generate themes. We used Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS) as an analytic lens and organizing framework. RESULTS: Communication occurred in both structured and unstructured ways. Situation monitoring happened during routines, such as running the list, and led to creating a plan of patient care through shared decision-making. Some leadership characteristics were not exclusive to 1 team member. Finally, mutual support occurred through task completion and empowering learners; for example, attending physicians empowered senior residents, who also helped interns. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings aligned with some, but not all, teamwork principles from TeamSTEPPS; misalignment may be due to contextual factors, such as the need to provide medical education and the development of grassroots routines (eg, running the list). Context is a key consideration when developing interventions to enhance teamwork on inpatient medical wards.",Teamwork on Rounds on an Inpatient Ward Team: An Ethnographic Study.
"Hsp104 is a hexameric AAA + ATPase and protein disaggregase found in yeast, which can be potentiated via mutations in its middle domain (MD) to counter toxic phase separation by TDP-43, FUS and alpha-synuclein connected to devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Subtle missense mutations in the Hsp104 MD can enhance activity, indicating that post-translational modification of specific MD residues might also potentiate Hsp104. Indeed, several serine and threonine residues throughout Hsp104 can be phosphorylated in vivo. Here, we introduce phosphomimetic aspartate or glutamate residues at these positions and assess Hsp104 activity. Remarkably, phosphomimetic T499D/E and S535D/E mutations in the MD enable Hsp104 to counter TDP-43, FUS and alpha-synuclein aggregation and toxicity in yeast, whereas T499A/V/I and S535A do not. Moreover, Hsp104T499E and Hsp104S535E exhibit enhanced ATPase activity and Hsp70-independent disaggregase activity in vitro. We suggest that phosphorylation of T499 or S535 may elicit enhanced Hsp104 disaggregase activity in a reversible and regulated manner.",Potentiating Hsp104 activity via phosphomimetic mutations in the middle domain.
"3-Hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAO) is an iron-dependent protein that activates O2 and inserts both oxygen atoms into 3-hydroxyanthranilate (3-HAA). An intriguing question is how HAO can rapidly bind O2, even though local O2 concentrations and diffusion rates are relatively low. Here, a close inspection of the HAO structures revealed that substrate- and inhibitor-bound structures exhibit a closed conformation with three hydrophobic loop regions moving toward the catalytic iron center, whereas the ligand-free structure is open. We hypothesized that these loop movements enhance O2 binding to the binary complex of HAO and 3-HAA. We found that the carboxyl end of 3-HAA triggers changes in two loop regions and that the third loop movement appears to be driven by an H-bond interaction between Asn(27) and Ile(142) Mutational analyses revealed that N27A, I142A, and I142P variants cannot form a closed conformation, and steady-state kinetic assays indicated that these variants have a substantially higher Km for O2 than WT HAO. This observation suggested enhanced hydrophobicity at the iron center resulting from the concerted loop movements after the binding of the primary substrate, which is hydrophilic. Given that O2 is nonpolar, the increased hydrophobicity at the iron center of the binary complex appears to be essential for rapid O2 binding and activation, explaining the reason for the 3-HAA-induced loop movements. Because substrate binding-induced open-to-closed conformational changes are common, the results reported here may help further our understanding of how oxygen is enriched in nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenases.","Adapting to oxygen: 3-Hydroxyanthrinilate 3,4-dioxygenase employs loop dynamics to accommodate two substrates with disparate polarities."
"Venous outflow obstruction is a dominant contributor to chronic venous disease. Treatment of venous disease has historically been limited by available vascular stent technology not specifically designed for the venous system. The ideal venous stent must provide requisite flexibility, strength, and accurate deployment for the anatomical and pathophysiological conditions of chronic venous disease. Venous stent technology is advancing with multiple dedicated venous stents currently available in Europe and with investigational device exemption studies ongoing in the United States.

"OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression is associated with increased tumor invasiveness and proliferation in CRC, and COX-2 inhibition has demonstrated chemopreventive activity. This study investigated the addition of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, to the irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (IFL) regimen for patients with previously untreated metastatic CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients enrolled in this single-arm phase II study received celecoxib at 400 mg orally twice daily in combination with weekly irinotecan (125 mg/m), 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m), and leucovorin (20 mg/m) for 4 weeks every 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was response rate (RR) as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The protocol was amended midway to additionally exclude patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2 and require all patients with specific cardiovascular risk factors to take daily aspirin (81 mg). RESULTS: The objective RR was 31.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19%-47%). Median progression-free survival was 8.7 months (95% CI, 5.8-10.6), and the median overall survival was 19.7 months (95% CI, 15.4-22.8). All cardiac events were observed before protocol modification. The median overall survival before and after protocol modification was 11.4 versus 24.2 months, respectively (P<0.0001); tumor RR and progression-free survival were not statistically different before or after protocol modification. The trial was halted after an interim analysis demonstrated that the primary endpoint would not be met. CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib plus IFL chemotherapy for patients with metastatic CRC is tolerable, but does not appear to increase the efficacy of IFL.","A Phase II Study of Celecoxib With Irinotecan, 5-Fluorouracil, and Leucovorin in Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer."

"OBJECTIVE: To formulate clinical consensus recommendations for screening depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and disordered eating symptoms in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and review prevalence based on phenotypes and ethnicity, changes over time, etiology, and impact of treatment. DESIGN: Systematic reviews and preparation of position statement. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Women with PCOS and controls screened using validated tools. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, disordered eating, and HRQoL scores. RESULT(S): Several studies demonstrate that women with PCOS have an increased prevalence of higher depression and anxiety scores and higher odds of moderate and severe depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with controls. Obesity, hyperandrogenism, and fertility have a weak association with these symptoms. HRQoL scores are consistently reduced in PCOS, with infertility and weight concerns having the most significant impact. Some studies suggest an increased prevalence of disordered eating in women with PCOS compared with controls. The few studies that have evaluated the impact of PCOS-related treatments (lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy) show no detrimental effect or some improvement in depressive and anxiety symptoms and HRQoL scores. CONCLUSION(S): In women with PCOS, screening for depressive and anxiety symptoms should be offered at the time of diagnosis and screening for disordered eating should be considered. Further research is required across PCOS phenotypes, in longitudinal cohorts and on impact of therapy on depressive and anxiety syptoms, HRQOL, and disordered eating.","Androgen Excess- Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society: position statement on depression, anxiety, quality of life, and eating disorders in polycystic ovary syndrome."
"Individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) are at elevated risk of developing treatable psychiatric and neurological disorders, including anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, seizures, and movement disorders, often beginning in adolescence or early to mid-adulthood. Here, we provide an overview of neuropsychiatric features associated with 22q11.2DS in adulthood. Results of a new case series of 13 individuals with 22q11.2DS and catatonic features together with 5 previously reported cases support a potential association of this serious psychomotor phenotype with the 22q11.2 deletion. As in the general population, catatonic features in 22q11.2DS occurred in individuals with schizophrenia, other psychotic and non-psychotic psychiatric disorders, and neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease. We place the results in the context of an updated review of catatonia in other genetic conditions. The complex neuropsychiatric expression and risk profile of 22q11.2DS highlights the need to consider co-morbid factors and provide care tailored to the individual patient. The results reinforce the need for periodic monitoring for the emergence of psychiatric and neurological manifestations including catatonic features.

Interestingly however, between 2012 and 2017, 18 patients were reported at hospitals in Massachusetts with sudden-onset amnesia in the setting of complete diffusion-weighted hyperintensity of both hippocampi on magnetic resonance imaging. Notably, 17 of the 18 patients tested positive for opioids or had a recorded history of opioid use. This observation suggests an association between opioids and acute hippocampal injury. With particular attention to the Massachusetts cluster and data on fentanyl and its congeners, the epidemiological and pathophysiological evidence that supports this hypothesis is presented, as are potential underlying mechanisms.",Connecting the dots: an association between opioids and acute hippocampal injury.
"The relation between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and memory dysfunction is well established, yet imprecise. Here, we investigate whether mild TBI causes a specific deficit in spatial episodic memory. Fifty-eight (29 TBI, 29 sham) mice were run in a spatial recognition task. To determine which phase of memory might be affected in our task, we assessed rodent performance at three different delay times (3 min, 1 h, and 24 h). We found that sham and TBI mice performed equally well at 3 min, but TBI mice had significantly impaired spatial recognition memory after a delay time of 1 h. Neither sham nor injured mice remembered the test object locations after a 24-h delay. In addition, the TBI-specific impairment was accompanied by a decrease in exploratory behavior during the first 3 mins of the initial exposure to the test objects. These memory and exploratory behavioral deficits were linked as branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) dietary therapy restored both memory performance and normal exploratory behavior. Our findings 1) support the use of BCAA therapy as a potential treatment for mild TBI and 2) suggest that poor memory performance post-TBI is associated with a deficit in exploratory behavior that is likely to underlie the encoding needed for memory formation.",Memory Deficit in an Object Location Task after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Is Associated with Impaired Early Object Exploration and Both Are Restored by Branched Chain Amino Acid Dietary Therapy.

"The current echocardiographic diagnostic criteria for noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) have variable sensitivity and low specificity. Moreover, there are limited data on the use of myocardial deformation imaging for early detection of myocardial dysfunction in children with NCC. We describe left ventricular (LV) deformation patterns in children with NCC, with the goal of identifying a potential diagnostic pattern. We prospectively enrolled 30 children with NCC (47% male; mean age 7.2 years) and 30 age- and gender-matched controls. Extent and severity of non compaction in each segment were evaluated in LV 16-segment model. Regional (base, mid and apex) and segmental (16 segments) longitudinal strain (LS), circumferential strain (CS) and radial strain (RS) were measured using speckle tracking echocardiography. In all patients with NCC, regional and segmental CS and RS at the apex were significantly decreased compared to controls (CS apex: - 19.2 +/- 5.4% vs. - 30.2 +/- 6.9%, p < 0.001/RS apex: 23.5 +/- 8.6% vs. 44.1 +/- 14.5%, p < 0.001). Thirty percent (9/30) of patients had an EF < 50%.

"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify injunctive norms for cyberbullying prevention among youths, parents, and primary care providers, as well as barriers to preventive behaviours. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews on the topic of cyberbullying were conducted with 29 adolescents, 13 paediatricians, and 15 parents recruited from 3 primary care sites. Transcripts were coded for themes related to various stakeholders' perceived roles in cyberbullying prevention and barriers to preventive behaviours. RESULTS: Participants reported perceptions that youths should intervene in the moment and get outside help for others. Fear of repercussions emerged as a significant barrier to these behaviours. Participants believed that parents should communicate with their children and monitor and supervise youths' online activities. Barriers included perception of priority and low parental efficacy or naivete. Participants believed that providers should provide education and resources and ask screening questions; the most frequently identified barrier to those behaviours was the perception of providers' role.

"Immune cell-mediated destruction of salivary glands is a hallmark feature of Sjogren syndrome. Similar to the female predominance in humans, female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice develop spontaneous salivary gland autoimmunity. However, in both humans and mice it is unclear what factors contribute to the initial immune infiltration of the salivary glands. Here, we used an adoptive transfer model of Sjogren syndrome to determine if female mice harbor a sex-specific defect in salivary-gland-protective regulatory T (Treg) cells. Transfer of cervical lymph node (LN) cells from female NOD mice into sex-matched NOD-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) recipients resulted in sialadenitis, regardless of the presence or absence of Treg cells. In contrast, transfer of cervical LN cells from male NOD mice into sex-matched NOD-SCID recipients only resulted in sialadenitis when Treg cells were depleted before transfer, suggesting that male NOD mice have functional salivary-gland-protective Treg cells. Notably, the host environment affected the ability of Treg cells to prevent sialadenitis with testosterone promoting salivary gland protection. Treg cells from male mice did not protect against sialadenitis in female recipients. Testosterone treatment of female recipients of bulk cervical LN cells decreased sialadenitis, and Treg cells from female mice were capable of protecting against development of sialadenitis in male recipients. Hence, our data demonstrate that female NOD mice develop sialadenitis through a defect in salivary-gland-protective Treg cells that can be reversed in the presence of testosterone.",Salivary-gland-protective regulatory T-cell dysfunction underlies female-specific sialadenitis in the non-obese diabetic mouse model of Sjogren syndrome.
"OBJECTIVE: Reducing environmental noise benefits premature infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), but excessive reduction may lead to sensory deprivation, compromising development. Instead of minimal noise levels, environments that mimic intrauterine soundscapes may facilitate infant development by providing a sound environment reflecting fetal life. This soundscape may support autonomic and emotional development in preterm infants. We aimed to assess the efficacy and feasibility of external non-invasive recordings in pregnant women, endeavoring to capture intra-abdominal or womb sounds during pregnancy with electronic stethoscopes and build a womb sound library to assess sound trends with gestational development. We also compared these sounds to popular commercial womb sounds marketed to new parents. STUDY DESIGN: Intra-abdominal sounds from 50 mothers in their second and third trimester (13 to 40 weeks) of pregnancy were recorded for 6 minutes in a quiet clinic room with 4 electronic stethoscopes, placed in the right upper and lower quadrants, and left upper and lower quadrants of the abdomen. These recording were partitioned into 2-minute intervals in three different positions: standing, sitting and lying supine. Maternal and gestational age, Body Mass Index (BMI) and time since last meal were collected during recordings. Recordings were analyzed using long-term average spectral and waveform analysis, and compared to sounds from non-pregnant abdomens and commercially-marketed womb sounds selected for their availability, popularity, and claims they mimic the intrauterine environment. RESULTS: Maternal sounds shared certain common characteristics, but varied with gestational age. With fetal development, the maternal abdomen filtered high (500-5,000 Hz) and mid-frequency (100-500 Hz) energy bands, but no change appeared in contributions from low-frequency signals (10-100 Hz) with gestational age. Variation appeared between mothers, suggesting a resonant chamber role for intra-abdominal space. Compared to commercially-marketed sounds, womb signals were dominated by bowel sounds, were of lower frequency, and showed more variation in intensity. CONCLUSIONS: High-fidelity intra-abdominal or womb sounds during pregnancy can be recorded non-invasively. Recordings vary with gestational age, and show a predominance of low frequency noise and bowel sounds which are distinct from popular commercial products. Such recordings may be utilized to determine whether sounds influence preterm infant development in the NICU.",A description of externally recorded womb sounds in human subjects during gestation.
"PURPOSE: Repackaged bevacizumab in single-dose, prefilled syringes for intravitreal injection is available, but with shelf life limited from 60 days to 90 days. For the Study of COmparative Treatments for REtinal Vein Occlusion 2 (SCORE2), 2-mL sterile glass vials were used rather than prefilled syringes to provide a longer shelf life for study supplies. METHODS: Repackaged bevacizumab in glass vials was tested at release and, for 1 lot, after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months for physical stability, including concentration, purity and appearance, and for sterility and endotoxins. Vials from 2 lots were tested at release and after 20 months and 21 months, respectively. One lot was tested at 21 months for anti-VEGF bioactivity compared with a fresh supply of commercial bevacizumab. RESULTS: Repackaged bevacizumab in 2-mL glass vials continued to meet all quality release specifications and remain sterile for up to 21 months. In addition, no degradation in anti-VEGF bioactivity was observed at 21 months compared with a fresh bevacizumab control. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab can be repackaged into small, single-dose glass vials for intravitreal injection and the qualities of the commercial product maintained, including anti-VEGF bioactivity, for up to 21 months in refrigerated storage. Consideration should be given to repackaging bevacizumab for ophthalmic use in small glass vials as opposed to plastic syringes.","LONG-TERM PHYSICAL STABILITY, STERILITY, AND ANTI-VEGF BIOACTIVITY OF REPACKAGED BEVACIZUMAB IN 2-ML GLASS VIALS."
"PURPOSE: To describe spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) findings in an Amish cohort to assess SD-OCT markers for early age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: The authors performed a family-based prospective cohort study of 1,146 elderly Amish subjects (age range 50-99 years) (2,292 eyes) who had a family history of at least 1 individual with AMD. All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examinations, SD-OCT using both Cirrus and Spectralis (20 x 20 degrees scan area) instruments, fundus autofluorescence, infrared imaging, and color fundus photography. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography characteristics were analyzed in subjects with AMD (with and without subretinal drusenoid deposits [SDDs]) and normal healthy cohorts. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 65.2 years (SD +/- 11). Color fundus photographic findings in 596 (53%) subjects (1,009 eyes) were consistent with AMD; the remaining 478 (43%) subjects showed no signs of AMD. The choroid was significantly thinner on OCT (242 +/- 76 microm, P < 0.001) in those with AMD compared with those without (263 +/- 63 microm). Subretinal drusenoid deposits were found in 143 eyes (7%); 11 of the 143 eyes (8%) had no other manifestations of AMD. Drusen volume (P < 0.001) and area of geographic atrophy (P < 0.001) were significantly greater, and choroid was significantly (P < 0.001) thinner in subjects with SDDs versus those without SDDs. CONCLUSION: The authors describe spectral domain optical coherence tomography characteristics in an elderly Amish population with and without AMD, including the frequency of SDD. Although relatively uncommon in this population, the authors confirmed that SDDs can be found in the absence of other features of AMD and that eyes with SDDs have thinner choroids.",AMISH EYE STUDY: Baseline Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Characteristics of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
"Purpose Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a brainstem malignancy with a median survival of < 1 year. The International and European Society for Pediatric Oncology DIPG Registries collaborated to compare clinical, radiologic, and histomolecular characteristics between short-term survivors (STSs) and long-term survivors (LTSs). Materials and Methods Data abstracted from registry databases included patients from North America, Australia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, and Croatia. Results Among 1,130 pediatric and young adults with radiographically confirmed DIPG, 122 (11%) were excluded. Of the 1,008 remaining patients, 101 (10%) were LTSs (survival >/= 2 years). Median survival time was 11 months (interquartile range, 7.5 to 16 months), and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival rates were 42.3% (95% CI, 38.1% to 44.1%), 9.6% (95% CI, 7.8% to 11.3%), 4.3% (95% CI, 3.2% to 5.8%), 3.2% (95% CI, 2.4% to 4.6%), and 2.2% (95% CI, 1.4% to 3.4%), respectively. LTSs, compared with STSs, more commonly presented at age < 3 or > 10 years (11% v 3% and 33% v 23%, respectively; P < .001) and with longer symptom duration ( P < .001). STSs, compared with LTSs, more commonly presented with cranial nerve palsy (83% v 73%, respectively; P = .008), ring enhancement (38% v 23%, respectively; P = .007), necrosis (42% v 26%, respectively; P = .009), and extrapontine extension (92% v 86%, respectively; P = .04). LTSs more commonly received systemic therapy at diagnosis (88% v 75% for STSs; P = .005). Biopsies and autopsies were performed in 299 patients (30%) and 77 patients (10%), respectively; 181 tumors (48%) were molecularly characterized. LTSs were more likely to harbor a HIST1H3B mutation (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.5; P = .002). Conclusion We report clinical, radiologic, and molecular factors that correlate with survival in children and young adults with DIPG, which are important for risk stratification in future clinical trials.","Clinical, Radiologic, Pathologic, and Molecular Characteristics of Long-Term Survivors of Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG): A Collaborative Report From the International and European Society for Pediatric Oncology DIPG Registries."
"PURPOSE: To investigate advanced neoplasia (AN) after endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of colonic laterally spreading lesions (LSLs). METHODS: A retrospective study of patients who underwent injection-assisted EMR of colonic LSLs >/= 10 mm was performed. Primary outcome was overall rate of AN at initial surveillance colonoscopy. Secondary outcomes were the rates of residual AN (rAN) at the EMR site and metachronous AN (mAN), and analysis of risk factors for AN, including effect of surveillance guidance. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-four patients underwent successful EMR for 388 LSLs. AN occurred in 66/374 (17.6%) patients on initial surveillance colonoscopy at median follow-up of 364.5 days. Two patients had both rAN and mAN, for a total of 68 instances of AN, including 30/374 (8.0%) cases of rAN and 38/374 (10.2%) cases of mAN. On multivariate analysis, use of piecemeal resection was associated with increased likelihood of residual AN (P = 0.003, OR 9.2, 95% CI 2.1-33.3). Twenty-nine out of thirty cases (96.7%) of rAN were successfully endoscopically managed at surveillance colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: AN occurred in 17.6% of all patients at initial surveillance colonoscopy at a median of 1 year after EMR. Roughly half of the instances of AN were metachronous lesions. Our data support a 1-year surveillance interval after EMR of LSLs >/= 10 mm with careful inspection of the entire colon, not just the prior resection site.",Incidence and risk factors of advanced neoplasia after endoscopic mucosal resection of colonic laterally spreading lesions.

"OBJECTIVE: To provide an historic overview of the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) in clinical trials of tardive dyskinesia (TD), with current recommendations for analyzing and interpreting AIMS data. PARTICIPANTS: Seven psychiatrists and 1 neurologist were selected by the workshop sponsor based on each individual's clinical expertise and research experience. EVIDENCE: Using PubMed entries from January 1970 to August 2017, participants selected studies that used the AIMS to evaluate TD treatments. The selections were intended to be representative rather than prescriptive or exhaustive, and no specific recommendations for TD treatment are implied. CONSENSUS PROCESS: The Working Group met in October 2016 to discuss the AIMS as an assessment tool, outline the challenges of translating clinical trial results into everyday clinical practice, and propose different methods for reporting AIMS data in clinically relevant terms. Recommendations for selecting TD studies for review, analyzing and interpreting AIMS data, and synthesizing discussions among the participants were initiated during the onsite workshop and continued remotely throughout development of this report. Disagreements were resolved via group e-mails and teleconferences. Consensus was based on final approval of this report by all workshop participants. CONCLUSIONS: For both research and clinical practice, the AIMS is a valid measure for assessing TD and the effects of treatment, but alternative analyses of AIMS data (eg, effect size, minimal clinically important difference, response analyses, category shifts) may provide broader evidence of clinical effectiveness. No single analysis of AIMS data can be considered the standard of clinical efficacy; multiple analytic approaches are recommended.",Revisiting the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale: Proceedings From the Tardive Dyskinesia Assessment Workshop.

"PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with worse outcomes relative to other breast cancer subtypes. Chemotherapy remains the standard-of-care systemic therapy for patients with localized or metastatic disease, with few biomarkers to guide benefit. METHODS: We will discuss recent advances in our understanding of two key biological processes in TNBC, homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair deficiency and host anti-tumor immunity, and their intersection. RESULTS: Recent advances in our understanding of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, including FDA approval of PARP inhibitor olaparib for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers, and host anti-tumor immunity in TNBC offer potential for new and biomarker-driven approaches to treat TNBC. Assays interrogating HR DNA repair capacity may guide treatment with agents inducing or targeting DNA damage repair. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with improved prognosis in TNBC and recent efforts to characterize infiltrating immune cell subsets and activate host anti-tumor immunity offer promise, yet challenges remain particularly in tumors lacking pre-existing immune infiltrates. Advances in these fields provide potential biomarkers to stratify patients with TNBC and guide therapy: induction of DNA damage in HR-deficient tumors and activation of existing or recruitment of host anti-tumor immune cells. Importantly, these advances provide an opportunity to guide use of existing therapies and development of novel therapies for TNBC. Efforts to combine therapies that exploit HR deficiency to enhance the activity of immune-directed therapies offer promise. CONCLUSIONS: HR deficiency remains an important biomarker target and potentially effective adjunct to enhance immunogenicity of 'immune cold' TNBCs.",Homologous recombination deficiency and host anti-tumor immunity in triple-negative breast cancer.
"OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of disease on strength in two functionally important lower limb muscles for a period of 2 yrs in children with Duchene muscular dystrophy. DESIGN: Seventy-seven Duchene muscular dystrophy children participated in this study. Plantar flexors, knee extensors, strength, and performance on timed tests (6-min walk, 4-stairs, 10-m walk, supine-up) were assessed yearly for 2 yrs. Multivariate normal regression was used to assess changes in strength over time in the Duchene muscular dystrophy group. Spearman correlations were computed to examine relationship between strength and function. RESULTS: Normalized plantar flexor and knee extensor strength showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) over 2 yrs, with larger declines in knee extensor. At baseline, knee extensor strongly correlated with performance on timed tests. However, plantar flexor strength was found to be a stronger predictor of loss in ambulatory function. Modest correlations (r = 0.19-0.34) were found between the decline in strength and functional performance over 2 yrs. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the loss of lower limb strength in a large cohort of Duchene muscular dystrophy children for 2 yrs. The findings support that lower limb strength alone cannot account for the decline in performance on functional tests, and the role of other contributing factors, such as compensatory strategies, should be considered.",Two-Year Longitudinal Changes in Lower Limb Strength and Its Relation to Loss in Function in a Large Cohort of Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

"Herpes simplex virus type 1(HSV-1) presents a conundrum to public health worldwide because of its specific pathogenicity and clinical features. Some experimental vaccines, such as the recombinant viral glycoproteins, exhibit the viral immunogenicity of a host-specific immune response, but none of these has achieved a valid epidemiological protective efficacy in the human population. In the present study, we constructed an attenuated HSV-1 strain M3 through the partial deletion of UL7, UL41, and the latency-associated transcript (LAT) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The mutant strain exhibited lowered infectivity and virulence in macaques. Neutralization testing and ELISpot detection of the specific T-cell responses confirmed the specific immunity induced by M3 immunization and this immunity defended against the challenges of the wild-type strain and restricted the entry of the wild-type strain into the trigeminal ganglion. These results in rhesus macaques demonstrated the potential of the attenuated vaccine for the prevention of HSV-1 in humans.",Attenuated Phenotype and Immunogenic Characteristics of a Mutated Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Strain in the Rhesus Macaque.

"Objective: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Aerobic glycolysis is considered the seventh hallmark of cancer. The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is an important rate-limiting enzyme in glycolytic pathway, and is strongly expressed in several types of cancer. Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms of regulation of PKM2 is of great value for targeted therapy for lung cancer. Patients and methods: Seventy-three lung adenocarcinoma patients were analyzed in our study. The expression levels of PKM2 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry on tissues. The effect of small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) on PKM2 expression was investigated using Western blot assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. PKM2 SUMO1 modification was determined by in vitro and in vivo SUMOylation assays. (18)F-deoxyglucose uptake and lactate production measurements were conducted to research the levels of glycolysis. The level of oxidative phosphorylation in cells was determined by cellular oxygen consumption rate measurements. Cell proliferation assays were carried out to confirm the growth ability of tumor cells. Results: PKM2 was overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma patients based on immunohistochemical staining. Patients with high PKM2 expression had reduced overall survival rate (P=0.017) and disease-free survival rate (P=0.027) compared with those with low PKM2 expression. SUMO1 promoted PKM2-dependent glycolysis. Western blotting analysis showed that SUMO1 knockdown in A549 cells led to a significant decrease in PKM2 protein expression. PKM2 could be covalently modified by SUMO1 at K336 (Lys336) site. SUMO1 modification of PKM2 at Lys-336 site increased glycolysis and promoted its cofactor functions. Moreover, PKM2 SUMO1 modification promoted the proliferation of A549 cells in vitro. Conclusion: This information is important in elucidating a new mechanism of regulation of PKM2, and suggested that SUMO1 modification of PKM2 could be a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer.",Small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 modification of pyruvate kinase M2 promotes aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation in A549 human lung cancer cells.
"Pregnancy represents a critical period in fetal development, such that the prenatal environment can, in part, establish a lifelong trajectory of health or disease for the offspring. Poor nutrition (macro- or micronutrient deficiencies) can adversely affect brain development and significantly increase offspring risk for metabolic and neurological disease development. The concentration of dietary methyl-donor nutrients is known to alter DNA methylation in the brain, and alterations in DNA methylation can have long-lasting effects on gene expression and neuronal function. The decreased availability of methyl-donor nutrients to the developing fetus in models of poor maternal nutrition is one mechanism hypothesized to link maternal malnutrition and disease risk in offspring. Animal studies indicate that supplementation of both maternal and postnatal (early- and later-life) diets with methyl-donor nutrients can attenuate disease risk in offspring; however, clinical research is more equivocal. The objective of this review is to summarize how specific methyl-donor nutrient deficiencies and excesses during pre- and postnatal life alter neurodevelopment and cognition. Emphasis is placed on reviewing the current literature, highlighting challenges within nutrient supplementation research, and considering potential strategies to ensure robust findings in future studies.",Effect of supplementation with methyl-donor nutrients on neurodevelopment and cognition: considerations for future research.
"BACKGROUND: Infection, tissue damage and aging can cause inflammation with high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Overproduction of inflammatory cytokines often leads to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), severe sepsis, and septic shock. However, prominent therapeutic targets have not been found, although the incidence of sepsis is likely to increase annually. Our recent studies indicate that some RNA-binding proteins, which control gene expression of inflammatory cytokines at the post-transcriptional level, may play a critical role in inflammatory diseases such as sepsis. RESULTS: 1) One of the RNA-binding proteins, AT-rich interactive domain-containing 5a (Arid5a) promotes cytokine production through control of mRNA half-lives of pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-6, STAT3, T-bet, and OX40 in activated macrophages and T cells. Arid5a KO mice are refractory to endotoxin shock, bleomycininduced lung injury, and inflammatory autoimmune disease. 2) Chlorpromazine (CPZ), which is recognized as a psychotic drug, impairs post-transcriptional gene expression of Il6 in LPS-stimulated macrophages: CPZ inhibits the binding activity of Arid5a to the 3'UTR of Il6 mRNA, thereby destabilizing Il6 mRNA possibly through suppression of Arid5a expression. 3) CPZ has strong suppressive effects on cytokine production such as TNF-alpha in vivo. Mice with treatment of CPZ are resistant to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock. CONCLUSION: Thus, Arid5a contributes to the activation of macrophages and T cells through positive control of mRNA half-lives of inflammatory cytokines and its related molecules, which might lead to cytokine storm. Interestingly, Arid5a was identified from an inhibitory effect of CPZ on IL-6 production in macrophages activated by LPS. Therefore, CPZ derivatives or Arid5a inhibitors may have a potential to suppress severe sepsis through control of post-transcriptional gene expression.","A Potential Therapeutic Target RNA-binding Protein, Arid5a for the Treatment of Inflammatory Disease Associated with Aberrant Cytokine Expression."
"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus mainly transmitted to humans by mosquitoes from Aedes genus. Other ways of transmission include the perinatal and sexual routes, blood transfusion, and laboratory exposure. Although the first human cases were registered in 1952 in African countries, outbreaks were only reported since 2007, when entire Pacific islands were affected. In March 2015, the first cases of ZIKV acute infection were notified in Brazil and, to date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed local mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV. Until 2015, ZIKV infection was thought to only cause asymptomatic or mild exanthematous febrile infections. However, after explosive ZIKV outbreaks in Polynesia and Latin American countries, it was confirmed that ZIKV could also lead to Guillain-Barre syndrome and congenital birth abnormalities. These abnormalities, which can include neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and skeletal findings, are now considered congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Brain abnormalities in CZS include cerebral calcifications, malformations of cortical development, ventriculomegaly, lissencephaly, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and brainstem. The ocular findings, which are present in up to 70% of infants with CZS, include iris coloboma, lens subluxation, cataract, congenital glaucoma, and especially posterior segment findings. Loss of retinal pigment epithelium, the presence of a thin choroid, a perivascular choroidal inflammatory infiltrate, and atrophic changes within the optic nerve were seen in histologic analyses of eyes from deceased fetuses. To date, there is no ZIKV licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies are available for treatment. Preventive measures include individual protection from mosquito bites, control of mosquito populations and the use of barriers measures such as condoms during sexual intercourse or sexual abstinence for couples either at risk or after confirmed infection. A literature review based on studies that analyzed ocular findings in mothers and infants with CZS, with or without microcephaly, was conducted and a theoretical pathophysiologic explanation for ZIKV-ocular abnormalities was formulated.",Zika and the Eye: Pieces of a Puzzle.
"PURPOSE: To measure the association between institutional investment in high-value care (HVC) performance improvement and resident HVC experiences. METHOD: The authors analyzed data from two 2014 surveys assessing institutions' investments in HVC performance improvement as reported by program directors (PDs) and residents' perceptions of the frequency of HVC teaching, participation in HVC-focused quality improvement (QI), and views on HVC topics. The authors measured the association between institutional investment and resident-reported experiences using logistic regression, controlling for program and resident characteristics. RESULTS: The sample included 214 programs and 9,854 residents (59.3% of 361 programs, 55.2% of 17,851 residents surveyed). Most PDs (158/209; 75.6%) reported some support. Residents were more likely to report HVC discussions with faculty at least a few times weekly if they trained in programs that offered HVC-focused faculty development (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.37; P = .01), that supported such faculty development (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.04-1.41; P = .02), or that provided physician cost-of-care performance data (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.03-1.39; P = .02). Residents were more likely to report participation in HVC QI if they trained in programs with a formal HVC curriculum (OR = 1.83; 95% CI 1.48-2.27; P < .001) or with HVC-focused faculty development (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.15-1.85; P = .002).

"PURPOSE: Despite extensive research, mechanisms regulating postnatal eye growth and those responsible for ametropias are poorly understood. With the marked recent increases in myopia prevalence, robust and biologically-based clinical therapies to normalize refractive development in childhood are needed. Here, we review classic and contemporary literature about how circadian biology might provide clues to develop a framework to improve the understanding of myopia etiology, and possibly lead to rational approaches to ameliorate refractive errors developing in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Increasing evidence implicates diurnal and circadian rhythms in eye growth and refractive error development. In both humans and animals, ocular length and other anatomical and physiological features of the eye undergo diurnal oscillations. Systemically, such rhythms are primarily generated by the 'master clock' in the surpachiasmatic nucleus, which receives input from the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) through the activation of the photopigment melanopsin. The retina also has an endogenous circadian clock. In laboratory animals developing experimental myopia, oscillations of ocular parameters are perturbed. Retinal signaling is now believed to influence refractive development; dopamine, an important neurotransmitter found in the retina, not only entrains intrinsic retinal rhythms to the light:dark cycle, but it also modulates refractive development. Circadian clocks comprise a transcription/translation feedback control mechanism utilizing so-called clock genes that have now been associated with experimental ametropias. Contemporary clinical research is also reviving ideas first proposed in the nineteenth century that light exposures might impact refraction in children. As a result, properties of ambient lighting are being investigated in refractive development. In other areas of medical science, circadian dysregulation is now thought to impact many non-ocular disorders, likely because the patterns of modern artificial lighting exert adverse physiological effects on circadian pacemakers. How, or if, such modern light exposures and circadian dysregulation contribute to refractive development is not known. SUMMARY: The premise of this review is that circadian biology could be a productive area worthy of increased investigation, which might lead to the improved understanding of refractive development and improved therapeutic interventions.","Circadian rhythms, refractive development, and myopia."
"OBJECTIVES: Inflammation and inflammatory conditions have been associated with pancreatic cancer risk and progression in a number of clinical, epidemiological, and animal model studies. The goal of the present study is to identify plasma markers of inflammation associated with survival of pancreatic cancer patients, and assess their joint contribution to patient outcome. METHODS: We measured circulating levels of four established markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type II (sTNF-RII), and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1)) in 446 patients enrolled in an ongoing prospective clinic-based study. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Overall mortality was significantly increased in patients in the top quartile of CRP (HR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.82-3.49), IL-6 (HR = 2.78, 95% CI: 2.03-3.81), sTNF-RII (HR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.46-2.72), and MIC-1 (HR = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.83-3.50), compared to those in the bottom quartile (P-trend <0.0001 for all four comparisons). Furthermore, patients with higher circulating concentrations of all four cytokines had a median survival of 3.7 months; whereas, those with lower levels had a median survival of 19.2 months (HR = 4.55, 95% CI: 2.87-7.20, P-trend <0.0001). CONCLUSION: Individual elevated plasma inflammatory cytokines are associated with significant and dramatic reductions in pancreatic cancer patient survival. Furthermore, we observed an independent combined effect of those cytokines on patient survival, suggesting that multiple inflammatory pathways are likely involved in PDAC progression. Future research efforts to target the inflammatory state using combination strategies in pancreatic cancer patients are warranted.",Plasma inflammatory cytokines and survival of pancreatic cancer patients.
"All health professional organizations recommend exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months, with continued breastfeeding for 1 year or more after birth. Women cite lack of support from health professionals as a barrier to breastfeeding. Meanwhile, breastfeeding education is not considered essential to basic nursing education and students are not adequately prepared to support breastfeeding women. Therefore, a toolkit of comprehensive evidence-based breastfeeding educational materials was developed to provide essential breastfeeding knowledge. A study was performed to determine the effectiveness of the breastfeeding toolkit education in an associate degree nursing program. A pretest/posttest survey design with intervention and comparison groups was used. One hundred fourteen students completed pre- and posttests. Student knowledge was measured using a 12-item survey derived with minor modifications from Marzalik's 2004 instrument measuring breastfeeding knowledge. When pre- and posttests scores were compared within groups, both groups' knowledge scores increased. A change score was calculated with a significantly higher mean score for the intervention group. When regression analysis was used to control for the pretest score, belonging to the intervention group increased student scores but not significantly. The toolkit was developed to provide a curriculum that demonstrates enhanced learning to prepare nursing students for practice. The toolkit could be used in other settings, such as to educate staff nurses working with childbearing families.",Implementing a Breastfeeding Toolkit for Nursing Education.
"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Given heightened cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and that higher blood pressure (BP) represents greater CVD risk, we hypothesized that higher BP would predict more BP-related communication in rheumatology visits. We examined predictors of documented BP communication during RA clinic visits. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of RA patients identified in electronic health record records with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) receiving both primary and rheumatology care. Trained abstractors reviewed RA visit notes for ""BP communication"" using a standardized tool to elicit documentation about BP or HTN beyond recording vital signs. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the impact of BP category (American Heart Association: ideal normotension, pre-HTN, and stages I and II HTN) on odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of BP communication. RESULTS: Among 1267 RA patients, 40% experienced BP elevations meeting the definition of uncontrolled HTN. Of 2677 eligible RA visits, 22% contained any documented BP communication. After adjustment, models predicted only 31% of visits with markedly high BPs 160/100 mm Hg or greater would contain BP communication. Compared with stage I, stage II elevation did not significantly increase communication (odds ratio, 2.0 [95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.8] vs. 1.5 [1.2-2.2]), although both groups' odds exceeded pre-HTN and normotension. Less than 10% of eligible visits resulted in documented action steps recommending follow-up of high BP. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of BP magnitude, most RA clinic visits lacked documented communication about BP despite compounded CVD risk. Future work should study how rheumatology clinics can facilitate follow-up of high BPs to address HTN as the most common and reversible CVD risk factor.",Frequency and Predictors of Communication About High Blood Pressure in Rheumatoid Arthritis Visits.
"BACKGROUND: Increased recognition of the importance of competency-based education and assessment has led to the need for practical and reliable methods to assess relevant skills in the workplace. METHODS: A novel milestone-based workplace assessment system was implemented in 15 pediatrics residency programs. The system provided: (1) web-based multisource feedback (MSF) and structured clinical observation (SCO) instruments that could be completed on any computer or mobile device; and (2) monthly feedback reports that included competency-level scores and recommendations for improvement. RESULTS: For the final instruments, an average of five MSF and 3.7 SCO assessment instruments were completed for each of 292 interns; instruments required an average of 4-8 min to complete. Generalizability coefficients >0.80 were attainable with six MSF observations. Users indicated that the new system added value to their existing assessment program; the need to complete the local assessments in addition to the new assessments was identified as a burden of the overall process. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes - including high participation rates and high reliability compared to what has traditionally been found with workplace-based assessment - provide evidence for the validity of scores resulting from this novel competency-based assessment system. The development of this assessment model is generalizable to other specialties.",A novel workplace-based assessment for competency-based decisions and learner feedback.
"Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) to mismatched human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are associated with worse outcomes after lung transplantation. To determine the incidence and characteristics of DSA early after lung transplantation, we conducted a prospective multicenter observational study that used standardized treatment and testing protocols. Among 119 transplant recipients, 43 (36%) developed DSA: 6 (14%) developed DSA only to class I HLA, 23 (53%) developed DSA only to class II HLA, and 14 (33%) developed DSA to both class I and class II HLA. The median DSA mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was 3197. We identified a significant association between the Lung Allocation Score and the development of DSA (HR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.001-1.03, P = .047) and a significant association between DSA with an MFI >/= 3000 and acute cellular rejection (ACR) grade >/= A2 (HR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.04-4.27, P = .039). However, we did not detect an association between DSA and survival. We conclude that DSA occur frequently early after lung transplantation, and most target class II HLA. DSA with an MFI >/= 3000 have a significant association with ACR. Extended follow-up is necessary to determine the impact of DSA on other important outcomes.",Human leukocyte antigens antibodies after lung transplantation: Primary results of the HALT study.
"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are extremely rare in children. Imaging plays a key role in staging and monitoring therapy (surgical and with tyrosine kinase inhibitors). The vast majority of articles addressing imaging of GIST base on adults and are based on CT. The subtype ""pediatric GIST"" - if at all - is only mentioned in a dependent clause. Although the imaging features in children and adults are similar, histology, clinical course and thus imaging approach are different. METHODS: A PubMed search using the search terms ""Gastrointestinal stromal tumor, GIST, WT GIST, children, pediatric, carney's triad, imaging, staging, follow-up, MRI, CEUS, ultrasonography, Positron emission tomography"" was conducted. Studies that reported on laparoscopy, endoscopy and surgical techniques only were excluded. RESULTS: Based on our selective literature review, we present alternative radiological imaging strategies using MRI, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and PET-CT to stage and follow-up pediatric GIST patients. As pediatric GIST often is a chronic disease, minimizing exposure to ionizing radiation is mandatory. CONCLUSION: MRI, contrast enhanced ultrasound and PET-CT instead of CT are the imaging modalities to evaluate pediatric GIST.

"The International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system is broadly used by health-care providers, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to track health trends and statistics at the global, national, and local levels and to provide a reimbursement framework for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current iteration of the ICD system, the ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), was implemented in 2015. Although many changes to the prior ICD, Ninth Revision system were included in the ICD-10 system, the newer revision failed to adequately reflect advances in the clinical classification of certain diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH). Recently, a proposal to modify the ICD-10 codes for PH was considered and ultimately adopted for inclusion as an update to the ICD-10 coding system. Although these revisions better reflect the current clinical classification of PH, in the future, further changes should be considered to improve the accuracy and ease of coding for all forms of PH.",Breathing (and Coding?) a Bit Easier: Changes to International Classification of Disease Coding for Pulmonary Hypertension.
"Mechanisms through which anesthetics disrupt neuronal activity are incompletely understood. In order to study anesthetic mechanisms in the intact brain, tight control over anesthetic pharmacology in a genetically and neurophysiologically accessible animal model is essential. Here, we developed a pharmacokinetic model that quantitatively describes propofol distribution into and elimination out of the brain. To develop the model, we used jugular venous catheters to infuse propofol in mice and measured propofol concentration in serial timed brain and blood samples using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We then used adaptive fitting procedures to find parameters of a three compartment pharmacokinetic model such that all measurements collected in the blood and in the brain across different infusion schemes are fit by a single model. The purpose of the model was to develop target controlled infusion (TCI) capable of maintaining constant brain propofol concentration at the desired level. We validated the model for two different targeted concentrations in independent cohorts of experiments not used for model fitting. The predictions made by the model were unbiased, and the measured brain concentration was indistinguishable from the targeted concentration. We also verified that at the targeted concentration, state of anesthesia evidenced by slowing of the electroencephalogram and behavioral unresponsiveness was attained. Thus, we developed a useful tool for performing experiments necessitating use of anesthetics and for the investigation of mechanisms of action of propofol in mice.",Development and validation of brain target controlled infusion of propofol in mice.
"Baculovirus has traditionally been used for the production of recombinant protein and vaccine. However, more recently, baculovirus is emerging as a promising vector for gene therapy application. Here, baculovirus is produced by transient transfection of the baculovirus plasmid DNA (bacmid) in an adherent culture of Sf9 cells. Baculovirus is subsequently expanded in Sf9 cells in a serum-free suspension culture until the desired volume is obtained. It is then purified from the culture supernatant using heparin affinity chromatography. Virus supernatant is loaded onto the heparin column which binds baculovirus particles in the supernatant due to the affinity of heparin for baculovirus envelop glycoprotein. The column is washed with a buffer to remove contaminants and baculovirus is eluted from the column with a high-salt buffer. The eluate is diluted to an isotonic salt concentration and baculovirus particles are further concentrated using ultracentrifugation. Using this method, baculovirus can be concentrated up to 500-fold with a 25% recovery of infectious particles. Although the protocol described here demonstrates the production and purification of the baculovirus from cultures up to 1 L, the method can be scaled-up in a closed-system suspension culture to produce a clinical-grade vector for gene therapy application.",Production and Purification of Baculovirus for Gene Therapy Application.
"Nucleoside-containing metabolites such as NAD(+) can be incorporated as 5' caps on RNA by serving as non-canonical initiating nucleotides (NCINs) for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here, we report CapZyme-seq, a high-throughput-sequencing method that employs NCIN-decapping enzymes NudC and Rai1 to detect and quantify NCIN-capped RNA. By combining CapZyme-seq with multiplexed transcriptomics, we determine efficiencies of NAD(+) capping by Escherichia coli RNAP for approximately 16,000 promoter sequences. The results define preferred transcription start site (TSS) positions for NAD(+) capping and define a consensus promoter sequence for NAD(+) capping: HRRASWW (TSS underlined). By applying CapZyme-seq to E. coli total cellular RNA, we establish that sequence determinants for NCIN capping in vivo match the NAD(+)-capping consensus defined in vitro, and we identify and quantify NCIN-capped small RNAs (sRNAs). Our findings define the promoter-sequence determinants for NCIN capping with NAD(+) and provide a general method for analysis of NCIN capping in vitro and in vivo.",CapZyme-Seq Comprehensively Defines Promoter-Sequence Determinants for RNA 5' Capping with NAD<sup/>.
"Organized and hosted by the Children's Tumor Foundation (CTF), the Neurofibromatosis (NF) conference is the premier annual gathering for clinicians and researchers interested in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis (SWN). The 2016 edition constituted a blend of clinical and basic aspects of NF research that helped in clarifying different advances in the field. The incorporation of next generation sequencing is changing the way genetic diagnostics is performed for NF and related disorders, providing solutions to problems like genetic heterogeneity, overlapping clinical manifestations, or the presence of mosaicism. The transformation from plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is being clarified, along with new management and treatments for benign and premalignant tumors. Promising new cellular and in vivo models for understanding the musculoskeletal abnormalities in NF1, the development of NF2 or SWN associated schwannomas, and clarifying the cells that give rise to NF1-associated optic pathway glioma were presented. The interaction of neurofibromin and SPRED1 was described comprehensively, providing functional insight that will help in the interpretation of pathogenicity of certain missense variants identified in NF1 and Legius syndrome patients. Novel promising imaging techniques are being developed, as well as new integrative and holistic management models for patients that take into account psychological, social, and biological factors. Importantly, new therapeutic approaches for schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, PNF, and MPNST are being pursued.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' requirement to integrate tobacco treatment with lung cancer screening (LCS) has served as a catalyst for motivating pulmonary medicine clinicians to improve upon their ability to effectively treat tobacco dependence. To do so, clinicians need to be well versed in the behavioral and pharmacologic tools that promote smoking cessation. RECENT FINDINGS: The current review outlines current strategies for treating tobacco dependence, focusing on the important interplay between counseling and pharmacotherapy. Studies that have been found to be particularly effective in patients with smoking-related lung disease and in the LCS setting are reviewed. New therapies that are in the pipeline, as well as novel strategies aimed at improving both adoption and effectiveness of existing therapies, are discussed. SUMMARY: Treating tobacco dependence improves mortality and quality of life far more than the limited therapies available to treat smoking-related lung disease. Novel strategies to making tobacco treatment services more widely available, particularly to vulnerable patient populations, are needed to further decrease smoking-related morbidity and mortality. The Affordable Care Act's greater focus on prevention represents a moment of opportunity for healthcare providers and systems to engage in these efforts.",Treatment of tobacco dependence: current state of the art.
"BACKGROUND: When attempting to share information about comfort-oriented care, many use ""palliative,"" ""supportive,"" and ""hospice"" care terminology interchangeably, but we lack evidence about the effects of using these different terms. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to test whether the use of ""palliative,"" ""supportive,"" or ""hospice"" terminology can improve the dissemination of information among breast cancer patients-a large and growing oncology population. Design, Setting, and Measurement: This experimental study was conducted at a major U.S. hospital serving a diverse population. Patients visiting a cancer clinic encountered opportunities to learn more about cancer care. They were offered health materials that were described as reporting on ""palliative,"" ""supportive,"" or ""hospice"" care and the primary outcome was whether a patient decided to select or reject each. As a secondary outcome, the study measured the patient's level of interest in receiving each. RESULTS: Compared with alternatives, materials labeled as ""supportive"" care were most likely to be selected and considered valuable (p value <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the terminology used had a large effect and, compared with alternatives, the information labeled as being about ""supportive"" care was significantly more likely to be selected. If these effects are supported by additional research, there may be low-cost, highly feasible changes in language choice that increase the dissemination of relevant health information.","Increasing Information Dissemination in Cancer Communication: Effects of Using ""Palliative,"" ""Supportive,"" or ""Hospice"" Care Terminology."
"PURPOSE: The Janus-associated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway is a key regulator of inflammatory signaling, associated with tumorigenesis, cell survival, and progression. This randomized phase 2 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of the addition of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, to capecitabine in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and high systemic inflammation (modified Glasgow Prognostic Score [mGPS] >/= 1). METHODS: Patients with </= 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced or metastatic disease or hormone receptor-positive patients with disease progression on prior hormonal therapies were randomized 1:1 to 21-day cycles of ruxolitinib (n = 76) or placebo (n = 73) plus capecitabine. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. For ruxolitinib plus capecitabine versus placebo plus capecitabine, median OS was 11.2 months versus 10.9 months (log-rank test P = 0.762); median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.5 months versus 2.5 months (log-rank test P = 0.151); and overall response rate (ORR) was 28.9% versus 13.7% (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test P = 0.024), respectively. A more favorable change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was observed with ruxolitinib plus capecitabine versus placebo plus capecitabine. Both regimens were generally tolerable. A higher incidence of grade 3/4 anemia (25.4% vs 5.6%) and a lower incidence of grade 3/4 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (1.4% vs 12.7%) occurred with ruxolitinib plus capecitabine versus placebo plus capecitabine. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ruxolitinib to capecitabine for patients with advanced breast cancer and high systemic inflammation was generally tolerable; ORR was numerically greater, a more favorable change in HRQoL was observed, but neither OS nor PFS was improved compared with placebo plus capecitabine.","A randomized, double-blind, phase 2 study of ruxolitinib or placebo in combination with capecitabine in patients with advanced HER2-negative breast cancer and elevated C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammation."

"Sensitization is common in pediatric heart transplant candidates and waitlist mortality is high. Transplantation across a positive crossmatch may reduce wait time, but is considered high risk. We prospectively recruited consecutive candidates at eight North American centers. At transplantation, subjects were categorized as nonsensitized or sensitized (presence of >/=1 HLA antibody with MFI >/=1000 using single antigen beads). Sensitized subjects were further classified as complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch (CDC-crossmatch) positive or negative and as donor-specific antibodies (DSA) positive or negative. Immunosuppression was standardized. CDC-crossmatch-positive subjects also received perioperative antibody removal, maintenance corticosteroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin. The primary endpoint was the 1 year incidence rate of a composite of death, retransplantation, or rejection with hemodynamic compromise. 317 subjects were screened, 290 enrolled and 240 transplanted (51 with pretransplant DSA, 11 with positive CDC-crossmatch). The incidence rates of the primary endpoint did not differ statistically between groups; nonsensitized 6.7% (CI: 2.7%, 13.3%), sensitized crossmatch positive 18.2% (CI: 2.3%, 51.8%), sensitized crossmatch negative 10.7% (CI: 5.7%, 18.0%), P = .2354. The primary endpoint also did not differ by DSA status. Freedom from antibody-mediated and cellular rejection was lower in the crossmatch positive group and/or in the presence of DSA.

"PURPOSE: Low signal-to-noise-ratio and limited scan time of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in current clinical settings impede obtaining images with high spatial and angular resolution (HSAR) for a reliable fiber reconstruction with fine anatomical details. To overcome this problem, we propose a joint space-angle regularization approach to reconstruct HSAR diffusion signals from a single 4D low resolution (LR) dMRI, which is down-sampled in both 3D-space and q-space. METHODS: Different from the existing works which combine multiple 4D LR diffusion images acquired using specific acquisition protocols, the proposed method reconstructs HSAR dMRI from only a single 4D dMRI by exploring and integrating two key priors, that is, the nonlocal self-similarity in the spatial domain as a prior to increase spatial resolution and ridgelet approximations in the diffusion domain as another prior to increase the angular resolution of dMRI. To more effectively capture nonlocal self-similarity in the spatial domain, a novel 3D block-based nonlocal means filter is imposed as the 3D image space regularization term which is accurate in measuring the similarity and fast for 3D reconstruction. To reduce computational complexity, we use the L2 -norm instead of sparsity constraint on the representation coefficients. RESULTS: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain the HSAR dMRI efficiently with approximately 2% per-voxel root-mean-square error between the actual and reconstructed HSAR dMRI. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach can effectively increase the spatial and angular resolution of the dMRI which is independent of the acquisition protocol, thus overcomes the inherent resolution limitation of imaging systems.",A joint space-angle regularization approach for single 4D diffusion image super-resolution.
"BACKGROUND: An issue associated with efficient bioethanol production is the fact that the desired product is toxic to the biocatalyst. Among other effects, ethanol has previously been found to influence the membrane of E. coli in a dose-dependent manner and induce changes in the lipid composition of the plasma membrane. We describe here the characterization of a collection of ethanol-tolerant strains derived from the ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain FBR5. RESULTS: Membrane permeability assays indicate that many of the strains in the collection have alterations in membrane permeability and/or responsiveness of the membrane to environmental changes such as temperature shifts or ethanol exposure. However, analysis of the strains by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed no qualitative changes in the acyl chain composition of membrane lipids in response to ethanol or temperature. To determine whether these strains contain any mutations that might contribute to ethanol tolerance or changes in membrane permeability, we sequenced the entire genome of each strain. Unexpectedly, none of the strains displayed mutations in genes known to control membrane lipid synthesis, and a few strains carried no mutations at all. Interestingly, we found that four independently-isolated strains acquired an identical C --> A (V244 V) silent mutation in the ferric citrate transporter gene fecA. Further, we demonstrated that either a deletion of fecA or over-expression of fecA can confer increased ethanol survival, suggesting that any misregulation of fecA expression affects the cellular response to ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that no mutations were observed in several ethanol-tolerant strains suggested that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in E. coli ethanol tolerance and membrane permeability. Our data also represent the first direct phenotypic evidence that the fecA gene plays a role in ethanol tolerance. We propose that the recurring silent mutation may exert an effect on phenotype by altering RNA-mediated regulation of fecA expression.",A Recurrent Silent Mutation Implicates fecA in Ethanol Tolerance by Escherichia coli.

"BACKGROUND: Multivariate predictive models for estimating the risk of neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) are available as a Web-based sepsis risk calculator (SRC) and may reduce the proportion of newborns empirically treated with antibiotics after birth. EOS risk assessment based on such models would require workflow changes at most birth hospitals. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of obstetric, neonatal, and information technology staff at a large, academic, birth hospital collaborated to implement the SRC. The obstetric electronic medical record was modified to provide a link to the SRC. Labor and delivery nurses calculated the sepsis risk at birth and alerted neonatal clinicians for risk estimates >/=0.7 cases per 1000 live births. Subsequent interventions were based on the risk estimate and newborn clinical examination. We compared the proportion of infants born at >/=36 weeks' gestation with laboratory testing and empirical antibiotics for risk of EOS during the 15-month periods before (n = 5692) and after (n = 6090) implementation. EOS cases were reviewed to assess for safety. RESULTS: Empirical antibiotic use among newborns </=72 hours old declined by 42% (6.3% to 3.7%; relative risk 0.58 [95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.69]), and laboratory testing declined by 82% (26.9% to 4.9%; relative risk 0.18 [95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.21]). The EOS incidence was not different between the study periods, and no safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The SRC was integrated into the workflow of a large, academic perinatal center, resulting in significant reductions in antibiotics and laboratory testing for EOS and demonstrating the potential for this approach to impact national practice.",Implementation of the Sepsis Risk Calculator at an Academic Birth Hospital.
"T-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of rare malignancies with overlapping clinical, immunologic, and histologic features. Recent advances in our understanding of T-cell differentiation based on gene expression profiling, next-generation sequencing, and transgenic mouse modeling studies have better elucidated the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the diverse biology of T-cell lymphomas. These studies show that although genetic alterations in epigenetic modifiers are implicated in all subtypes of T-cell lymphomas, specific subtypes demonstrate enrichment for particular recurrent alterations targeting specific genes. In this regard, RHOA and TET2 alterations are prevalent in nodal T-cell lymphomas, particularly angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas, peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) not otherwise specified, and nodal PTCLs with T-follicular helper phenotype. JAK-STAT signaling pathways are mutationally activated in many extranodal T-cell lymphomas, such as natural killer/T-cell and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas. The functional significance of many of these genetic alterations is becoming better understood. Altogether these advances will continue to refine diagnostic criteria, improve prognostication, and identify novel therapeutic targets, resulting in improved outcomes for patient with T-cell lymphomas.",Novel insights into the pathogenesis of T-cell lymphomas.
"PURPOSE: This study reports the effect of disease-modifying therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) over 6 months and incident hypertension over 3 years in a large administrative database. METHODS: We used administrative Veterans Affairs databases to define unique dispensing episodes of methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and prednisone among patients with RA. Changes in SBP and DBP in the 6 months before disease-modifying antirheumatic drug initiation were compared with changes observed in the 6 months after initiation. The risk of incident hypertension within 3 years (new diagnosis code for hypertension and prescription for antihypertensive) was also assessed. Multivariable models and propensity analyses assessed the impact of confounding by indication. RESULTS: A total of 37,900 treatment courses in 21,216 unique patients contributed data. Overall, there were no changes in SBP or DBP in 6 months prior to disease-modifying antirheumatic drug initiation (all P > 0.62). In contrast, there was a decline in SBP (beta = -1.08 [-1.32 to -0.85]; P < 0.0001) and DBP (beta = -0.48 [-0.62 to -0.33]; P < 0.0001) over the 6 months following initiation. The greatest decline was observed among methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine users. Methotrexate users were 9% more likely to have optimal blood pressure (BP) after 6 months of treatment. Patients treated with leflunomide had increases in BP and a greater risk of incident hypertension compared with patients treated with methotrexate (hazard ratio, 1.53 [1.21-1.91]; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure may improve with treatment of RA, particularly with methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine. Leflunomide use, in contrast, is associated with increases in BP and a greater risk of incident hypertension.",Initiation of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Rheumatoid Arthritis Is Associated With Changes in Blood Pressure.
"Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a common complication after total joint arthroplasty leading to severe morbidity and mortality. With an aging population and increasing prevalence of total joint replacement procedures, the burden of PJI will be felt not only by individual patients, but in increased healthcare costs. Current treatment of PJI is inadequate resulting in incredibly high failure rates. This is believed to be largely mediated by the presence of bacterial biofilms. These polymicrobial bacterial colonies form within secreted extracellular matrices, adhering to the implant surface and local tissue. The biofilm architecture is believed to play a complex and critical role in a variety of bacterial processes including nutrient supplementation, metabolism, waste management, and antibiotic and immune resistance. The establishment of these biofilms relies heavily on the quorum sensing communication systems utilized by bacteria. Early stage research into disrupting bacterial communication by targeting quorum sensing show promise for future clinical applications. However, prevention of the biofilm formation via early forced induction of the biofilm forming process remains yet unexplored. (c) 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of anatomical variations of the musculotendinous junction of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) muscle, the relationship between FHL tendon or muscle and the tibial neurovascular bundle at the level of the posterior ankle joint in human cadavers. METHODS: Seventy embalmed feet from 20 male and 15 female cadavers, the cadavers' mean age was 65.4 (range from 14 to 82) years, were dissected and anatomically classified to observe FHL muscle morphology define the relationship between FHL tendon or muscle and the tibial neurovascular bundle. The distance between the musculotendinous junction and the relationship between FHL tendon or muscle and the tibial neurovascular bundle was determined. RESULTS: Three morphology types of FHL muscle were identified: a long lateral and shorter medial muscle belly, which was observed in 63 specimens (90%); equal length medial and lateral muscle bellies, this variant was only observed in five specimens (7.1%); one lateral and no medial muscle belly, which was observed in two specimens (2.9%). No statistically significant difference was observed according to gender or side (p > 0.05). Two patterns were identified and described between FHL tendon or muscle and the tibial neurovascular bundle. Pattern 1, the distance between the neurovascular bundle and FHL tendon was 3.46 mm (range 2.34-8.84, SD = 2.12) which was observed in 66 specimens (94.3%); Pattern 2, there was no distance which was observed in four specimens (5.7%). CONCLUSION: Knowing FHL muscle morphology, variations provide new important insights into secure planning and execution of a FHL transfer for Achilles tendon defect as well as for the interpretation of ultrasound and magnetic resonance images. With posterior arthroscopic for the treatment of various ankle pathologies, posteromedial portal may be introduced into the posterior aspect of the ankle without gross injury to the tibial neurovascular structures because of the gap between the neurovascular bundle and FHL tendon.",Anatomical feasibility study of flexor hallucis longus transfer in treatment of Achilles tendon and posteromedial portal of ankle arthroscopy.
"Study Design: Retrospective database study. Objectives: Analysis of economic and demographic data concerning lumbar disc arthroplasty (LDA) throughout the United States to improve value-based care and health care utilization. Methods: The National Inpatient Sample database was queried for patients who underwent primary or revision LDA between 2005 and 2013. Demographic and economic data included total surgeries, costs, length of stay, and frequency of routine discharge. The National Inpatient Sample database represents a 20% sample of discharges from US hospitals weighted to provide national estimates. Results: Primary LDA decreased 86% from 3059 to 420 from 2005 to 2013. The mean total cost of LDA increased 33% from $17 747 to $23 804. The mean length of stay decreased from 2.8 to 2.4 days. The mean routine discharge (home discharge without visiting nursing care) remained constant at 91%. Revision procedures (removal, supplemental fixation, or reoperation at the treated level) declined 30% from 194 to 135 cases over the study period. The mean revision burden, defined as the ratio of revision procedures to the sum of primary and revision procedures, was 12% (range 6% to 24%). The mean total cost of revisions ranged from $12 752 to $22 282. Conclusions: From 2005 to 2013, primary LDA significantly declined in the United States by 86% despite several studies pointing to improved efficacy and cost-efficiency. This disparity may be related to a lack of surgeon reimbursement from insurance companies. Congruently, the number of revision LDA cases has declined 30%, while revision burden has risen from 6% to 24%.",National Trends for Primary and Revision Lumbar Disc Arthroplasty Throughout the United States.
"BACKGROUND: Atomised intranasal dexmedetomidine administration is an attractive option when sedation is required for paediatric diagnostic procedures, as vascular access is not required. The risk of haemodynamic instability caused by dexmedetomidine necessitates better understanding of its pharmacokinetics in young children. To date, intranasal dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics has only been studied in adults. METHODS: Eighteen paediatric patients received dexmedetomidine 1 or 2 mug kg(-1) intranasally or 1 mug kg(-1) i.v. Plasma concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Non-compartmental analysis provided estimates of Cmax and Tmax. Volume of distribution, clearance, and bioavailability were estimated by simultaneous population PK analysis of data after intranasal and i.v. administration. Dexmedetomidine plasma concentration-time profiles were evaluated by simulation for intranasal and i.v. administration. RESULTS: An average peak plasma concentration of 199 pg ml(-1) was achieved 46 min after 1 mug kg(-1) dosing and 355 pg ml(-1) was achieved 47 min after 2 mug kg(-1) dosing. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model, with allometrically scaled parameters, adequately described the data. Typical bioavailability was 83.8% (95% confidence interval 69.5-98.1%). CONCLUSION: Mean arterial plasma concentrations of dexmedetomidine in infants and toddlers approached 100 pg ml(-1), the low end reported for sedative efficacy, within 20 min of an atomised intranasal administration of 1 mug kg(-1). Doubling the dose to 2 mug kg(-1) reached this plasma concentration within 10 min and achieved almost twice the peak concentration. Peak plasma concentrations with both doses were reached within 47 min of intranasal administration, with an overall bioavailability of 84%.",Does intranasal dexmedetomidine provide adequate plasma concentrations for sedation in children: a pharmacokinetic study.

"Islet beta cells from newborn mammals exhibit high basal insulin secretion and poor glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Here we show that beta cells of newborns secrete more insulin than adults in response to similar intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, suggesting differences in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of insulin secretion. Synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4), a non-Ca(2+) binding paralog of the beta cell Ca(2+) sensor Syt7, increased by approximately 8-fold during beta cell maturation. Syt4 ablation increased basal insulin secretion and compromised GSIS. Precocious Syt4 expression repressed basal insulin secretion but also impaired islet morphogenesis and GSIS. Syt4 was localized on insulin granules and Syt4 levels inversely related to the number of readily releasable vesicles. Thus, transcriptional regulation of Syt4 affects insulin secretion; Syt4 expression is regulated in part by Myt transcription factors, which repress Syt4 transcription. Finally, human SYT4 regulated GSIS in EndoC-betaH1 cells, a human beta cell line. These findings reveal the role that altered Ca(2+) sensing plays in regulating beta cell maturation.",Synaptotagmin 4 Regulates Pancreatic beta Cell Maturation by Modulating the Ca(2+) Sensitivity of Insulin Secretion Vesicles.

"AIM: To identify the genetic aetiology of a distinct leukoencephalopathy causing acute neurological regression in infancy with apparently complete clinical recovery. METHODS: We performed trio whole genome sequencing (WGS) to determine the genetic basis of the disorder. Mitochondrial function analysis in cultured patient fibroblasts was undertaken to confirm the pathogenicity of candidate variants. RESULTS: The patient presented at 18 months with acute hemiplegia and cognitive regression without obvious trigger. This was followed by clinical recovery over 4 years. MRI at disease onset revealed bilateral T2 hyperintensity involving the periventricular and deep white matter and MR spectroscopy of frontal white matter demonstrated a lactate doublet. Lactate levels and mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in muscle, liver and fibroblasts were normal. Plasma glycine was elevated. The MRI abnormalities improved. WGS identified compound heterozygous variants in BOLA3: one previously reported (c.136C>T, p.Arg46*) and one novel variant (c.176G>A, p.Cys59Tyr). Analysis of cultured patient fibroblasts demonstrated deficient pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and reduced quantity of protein subunits of mitochondrial complexes I and II, consistent with BOLA3 dysfunction. Previously reported cases of multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome 2 (MMDS2) with hyperglycinaemia caused by BOLA3 mutations have leukodystrophy with severe, progressive neurological and multisystem disease. CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel phenotype for MMDS2 associated with apparently complete clinical recovery and partial resolution of MRI abnormalities. We have identified a novel disease-causing variant in BOLA3 validated by functional cellular studies. Our patient's clinical course broadens the phenotypic spectrum of MMDS2 and highlights the potential for some genetic leukoencephalopathies to spontaneously improve.",Severe Leukoencephalopathy with Clinical Recovery Caused by Recessive BOLA3 Mutations.
"Viral vectors provide an efficient means for modification of eukaryotic cells, and their use is now commonplace in academic laboratories and industry for both research and clinical gene therapy applications. Lentiviral vectors, derived from the human immunodeficiency virus, have been extensively investigated and optimized over the past two decades. Third-generation, self-inactivating lentiviral vectors have recently been used in multiple clinical trials to introduce genes into hematopoietic stem cells to correct primary immunodeficiencies and hemoglobinopathies. These vectors have also been used to introduce genes into mature T cells to generate immunity to cancer through the delivery of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or cloned T-cell receptors. CAR T-cell therapies engineered using lentiviral vectors have demonstrated noteworthy clinical success in patients with B-cell malignancies leading to regulatory approval of the first genetically engineered cellular therapy using lentiviral vectors. In this review, we discuss several aspects of lentiviral vectors that will be of interest to clinicians, including an overview of lentiviral vector development, the current uses of viral vectors as therapy for primary immunodeficiencies and cancers, large-scale manufacturing of lentiviral vectors, and long-term follow-up of patients treated with gene therapy products.",Clinical use of lentiviral vectors.
"Background Nephronophthisis (NPH) is the most prevalent genetic cause for ESRD in children. However, little is known about the prevalence of NPH in adult-onset ESRD. Homozygous full gene deletions of the NPHP1 gene encoding nephrocystin-1 are a prominent cause of NPH. We determined the prevalence of NPH in adults by assessing homozygous NPHP1 full gene deletions in adult-onset ESRD.Methods Adult renal transplant recipients from five cohorts of the International Genetics and Translational Research in Transplantation Network (iGeneTRAiN) underwent single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. After quality control, we determined autosomal copy number variants (such as deletions) on the basis of median log2 ratios and B-allele frequency patterns. The findings were independently validated in one cohort. Patients were included in the analysis if they had adult-onset ESRD, defined as start of RRT at >/=18 years old.Results We included 5606 patients with adult-onset ESRD; 26 (0.5%) showed homozygous NPHP1 deletions. No donor controls showed homozygosity for this deletion. Median age at ESRD onset was 30 (range, 18-61) years old for patients with NPH, with 54% of patients age >/=30 years old. Notably, only three (12%) patients were phenotypically classified as having NPH, whereas most patients were defined as having CKD with unknown etiology (n=11; 42%).Conclusions Considering that other mutation types in NPHP1 or mutations in other NPH-causing genes were not analyzed, NPH is a relatively frequent monogenic cause of adult-onset ESRD. Because 88% of patients had not been clinically diagnosed with NPH, wider application of genetic testing in adult-onset ESRD may be warranted.",NPHP1 (Nephrocystin-1) Gene Deletions Cause Adult-Onset ESRD.
"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that chronic total occlusion (CTO) in a noninfarct-related artery in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction is linked to increased mortality. It remains unclear whether staged revascularization of a noninfarct-related artery CTO in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction translates to improved outcomes. We performed a meta-analysis to compare outcomes between patients presenting with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction with concurrent CTO who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention of noninfarct-related artery CTO versus those who did not. METHOD AND RESULTS: We conducted an electronic database search of all published data. The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular events. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting, stroke, and heart failure readmission. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. Random effects model was used and heterogeneity was considered if I(2) >25. Six studies (n=1253 patients) were included in the analysis. There was a significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular events (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91), cardiovascular mortality (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.95), and heart failure readmissions (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.89), favoring the patients in the CTO percutaneous coronary intervention group. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups for all-cause mortality (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.22-1.00), myocardial infarction (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.41-1.46), repeat revascularization (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.56-2.27), and stroke (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.20-1.33). CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, CTO percutaneous coronary intervention of the noninfarct-related artery in patients presenting with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction was associated with a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure readmissions.",Staged Percutaneous Intervention for Concurrent Chronic Total Occlusions in Patients With ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
"The National Institutes of Health have made substantial investments in genomic studies and technologies to identify DNA sequence variants associated with human disease phenotypes. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has been at the forefront of these commitments to ascertain genetic variation associated with heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases and related clinical traits. Genome-wide association studies, exome- and genome-sequencing studies, and exome-genotyping studies of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded epidemiological and clinical case-control studies are identifying large numbers of genetic variants associated with heart, lung, blood, and sleep phenotypes. However, investigators face challenges in identification of genomic variants that are functionally disruptive among the myriad of computationally implicated variants. Studies to define mechanisms of genetic disruption encoded by computationally identified genomic variants require reproducible, adaptable, and inexpensive methods to screen candidate variant and gene function. High-throughput strategies will permit a tiered variant discovery and genetic mechanism approach that begins with rapid functional screening of a large number of computationally implicated variants and genes for discovery of those that merit mechanistic investigation. As such, improved variant-to-gene and gene-to-function screens-and adequate support for such studies-are critical to accelerating the translation of genomic findings. In this White Paper, we outline the variety of novel technologies, assays, and model systems that are making such screens faster, cheaper, and more accurate, referencing published work and ongoing work supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's R21/R33 Functional Assays to Screen Genomic Hits program.

"Dermatologic adverse events (dAEs) are common with the use of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy. First- and second-generation agents (erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib) are frequently associated with acneiform rash, pruritus, xerosis, and paronychia; the incidence and characterization of these dAEs have been well described. However, there is evidence that the dAE profile is different with third-generation EGFR-TKIs. Herein, we describe the dAEs associated with third-generation EGFR-TKIs and our clinical experience with osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic, EGFR T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer in patients whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR-TKI therapy. Case summaries of patients from two of our institutions who received osimertinib and were referred to a dermatologist for dAEs are also presented. Overall, the evidence suggests that osimertinib is associated with less severe and less frequent dAEs than first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs and that therefore a different approach is warranted. Finally, we outline dAE management approaches for osimertinib in the context of those typically employed with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Appropriate prevention and management of dermatologic adverse events (dAEs) associated with the use of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) may help patients to continue therapy and lessen any negative impact on their quality of life. EGFR-TKIs are frequently associated with acneiform rash, pruritus, xerosis, and paronychia; however, dAEs associated with third-generation EGFR-TKIs are lower in frequency and severity. Before therapy, health care providers should discuss the potential osimertinib-associated dAEs and encourage patients to report their dAEs. Patients should also be educated on prophylactic measures to minimize the severity of dAEs and the importance of adherence to the treatment regimen.",Osimertinib: A Novel Dermatologic Adverse Event Profile in Patients with Lung Cancer.

"Ubiquitylation of histone H2B at lysine residue 120 (H2BK120ub) is a prominent histone posttranslational modification (PTM) associated with the actively transcribed genome. Although H2BK120ub triggers several critical downstream histone modification pathways and changes in chromatin structure, less is known about the regulation of the ubiquitylation reaction itself, in particular with respect to the modification status of the chromatin substrate. Here we employ an unbiased library screening approach to profile the impact of pre-existing chromatin modifications on de novo ubiquitylation of H2BK120 by the cognate human E2:E3 ligase pair, UBE2A:RNF20/40. Deposition of H2BK120ub is found to be highly sensitive to PTMs on the N-terminal tail of histone H2A, a crosstalk that extends to the common histone variant H2A.Z. Based on a series of biochemical and cell-based studies, we propose that this crosstalk contributes to the spatial organization of H2BK120ub on gene bodies, and is thus important for transcriptional regulation.",Functional crosstalk between histone H2B ubiquitylation and H2A modifications and variants.
"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with treatment delays in pediatric patients with convulsive refractory status epilepticus (rSE). METHODS: This prospective, observational study was performed from June 2011 to March 2017 on pediatric patients (1 month to 21 years of age) with rSE. We evaluated potential factors associated with increased treatment delays in a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: We studied 219 patients (53% males) with a median (25th-75th percentiles [p25-p75]) age of 3.9 (1.2-9.5) years in whom rSE started out of hospital (141 [64.4%]) or in hospital (78 [35.6%]). The median (p25-p75) time from seizure onset to treatment was 16 (5-45) minutes to first benzodiazepine (BZD), 63 (33-146) minutes to first non-BZD antiepileptic drug (AED), and 170 (107-539) minutes to first continuous infusion. Factors associated with more delays to administration of the first BZD were intermittent rSE (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-2.09; p = 0.0467) and out-of-hospital rSE onset (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.11-2.04; p = 0.0467). Factors associated with more delays to administration of the first non-BZD AED were intermittent rSE (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.32-2.4; p = 0.001) and out-of-hospital rSE onset (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.67-3.02; p < 0.0001). None of the studied factors were associated with a delayed administration of continuous infusion. CONCLUSION: Intermittent rSE and out-of-hospital rSE onset are independently associated with longer delays to administration of the first BZD and the first non-BZD AED in pediatric rSE. These factors identify potential targets for intervention to reduce time to treatment.",Factors associated with treatment delays in pediatric refractory convulsive status epilepticus.
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Caffeine is effective in the treatment of apnea of prematurity. Although caffeine therapy has a benefit on gross motor skills in school-aged children, effects on neurobehavioral outcomes are not fully understood. We aimed to investigate effects of neonatal caffeine therapy in very low birth weight (500-1250 g) infants on neurobehavioral outcomes in 11-year-old participants of the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity trial. METHODS: Thirteen academic hospitals in Canada, Australia, Great Britain, and Sweden participated in this part of the 11-year follow-up of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Measures of general intelligence, attention, executive function, visuomotor integration and perception, and behavior were obtained in up to 870 children. The effects of caffeine therapy were assessed by using regression models. RESULTS: Neurobehavioral outcomes were generally similar for both the caffeine and placebo group. The caffeine group performed better than the placebo group in fine motor coordination (mean difference [MD] = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7 to 5.1; P = .01), visuomotor integration (MD = 1.8; 95% CI: 0.0 to 3.7; P < .05), visual perception (MD = 2.0; 95% CI: 0.3 to 3.8; P = .02), and visuospatial organization (MD = 1.2; 95% CI: 0.4 to 2.0; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity improved visuomotor, visuoperceptual, and visuospatial abilities at age 11 years. General intelligence, attention, and behavior were not adversely affected by caffeine, which highlights the long-term safety of caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity in very low birth weight neonates.",Neurobehavioral Outcomes 11 Years After Neonatal Caffeine Therapy for Apnea of Prematurity.
"BACKGROUND: Pediatric unintentional falls are the leading cause of injury-related emergency visits for children < 5 years old. The purpose of this study was to identify population characteristics, injury mechanisms, and injury severities and patterns among children < 5 years to better inform age-appropriate falls prevention strategies. METHODS: This retrospective database study used trauma registry data from the lead pediatric trauma system in Georgia. Data were analyzed for all patients < 5 years with an international classification of disease, 9th revision, clinical modification (ICD-9 CM) external cause of injury code (E-code) for unintentional falls between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2015. Age (months) was compared across categories of demographic variables, injury mechanisms, and emergency department (ED) disposition using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and the Mann Whitney U test. The relationships between demographic variables, mechanism of injury (MOI), and Injury Severity Score (ISS) were evaluated using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 1086 patients (median age = 28 months; 59.7% male; 53.8% White; 49.1% < 1 m fall height). Younger children, < 1-year-old, primarily fell from caregiver's arms, bed, or furniture, while older children sustained more falls from furniture and playgrounds. Children who fell from playground equipment were older (median = 49 months, p < 0.01) than those who fell from the bed (median = 10 months), stairs (median = 18 months), or furniture (median = 19 months). Children < 1 year had the highest proportion of head injuries including skull fracture (63.1%) and intracranial hemorrhage (65.5%), 2-year-old children had the highest proportion of femur fractures (32.9%), and 4-year-old children had the highest proportion of humerus fractures (41.0%). Medicaid patients were younger (median = 24.5 months, p < 0.01) than private payer (median = 34 months). Black patients were younger (median = 20.5 months, p < 0.001) than White patients (median = 29 months). Results from multinomial logistic regression models suggest that as age increases, odds of a severe ISS (16-25) decreased (OR = 0.95, CI = 0.93-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric unintentional falls are a significant burden of injury for children < 5 years. Future work will use these risk and injury profiles to inform current safety recommendations and develop evidence-based interventions for parents/caregivers and pediatric providers.","Pediatric falls ages 0-4: understanding demographics, mechanisms, and injury severities."
"BACKGROUND: In 2014, suicide was the second leading cause of death among 10- to 24-year-olds in the US. Studies note disparities in youth suicide based on sex, race/ethnicity, and urban vs rural settings. This study investigates demographics, mental health indicators, and other circumstances surrounding youth/young adult deaths by suicide, comparing Chicago and suburban Cook County from 2005 to 2010. METHODS: Using the Illinois Violent Death Reporting System (IVDRS), we employed a cross-sectional design to provide descriptive analysis of decedents in three age groups (10-14, 15-19, and 20-24 years) in two geographic areas: urban (city of Chicago) and suburban (suburban Cook County) between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010. We used chi-square testing to test for significant differences in each age group by demographics, mental health indicators, and suicide markers in each area. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2010, the IVDRS reported 299 deaths by suicide among 10-24-year-olds, 52% in Chicago, and 48% in suburban Cook County. Of these deaths, 5.7%, 33.4% and 60.9% were ages 10-14, 15-19, and 20-24 years, respectively. Non-Hispanic (NH) whites comprised 50.7% of the totals, NH Blacks 26.5%, Hispanics 16.8%, and Asians 5.7%. In Chicago, males were 84% of suicides and 62.7% in suburban Cook County among 15-19-year-olds (p < 0.05). White race was significantly different in 10-14-year-olds: 0% in Chicago, 54% in suburban Cook County (p < 0.05). Racial and ethnic differences in suicides among 15-19-year-olds in Chicago vs suburban Cook County were: NH White 22.4% vs 74.5% (p < 0.001), NH Black 46.9% vs 13.7% (p < 0.05), Hispanic 24.5% vs 7.8% (p < 0.05). There were also differences for 20-24-year-olds with NH White 43% vs 65.4% and NH Black 32% vs 13.6% (p < 0.05 for both). For mechanism of death, in 15-19-year-olds, there were differences between city and suburban in firearm deaths (42.9% vs 20%, p < 0.05) and in poisoning (0 vs 14%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses detected significant location-related differences in the characteristics of decedents within the Chicago region indicating that local data are needed to inform suicide prevention efforts so that those at most risk can be prioritized for services. IVDRS is a potent tool in identifying these variations.",Cross sectional analysis of Chicago vs suburban Cook County suicide deaths among 10-24-year-olds in the Illinois violent death reporting system.

"OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a risk scoring system for predicting functional deterioration, institutionalization, and mortality. Identifying predictors of poor health outcomes informs clinical decision-making, service provision, and policy development to address the needs of persons at greatest risk for poor health outcomes. DESIGN: This is a cohort study with 21,257 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries 65 yrs and older who participated in the 2001-2008 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Derivation of the model was conducted in 60% of the sample and validated in the remaining 40%. Multinomial logistic regression model generated beta coefficients, which were used to create a risk scoring system. Our outcome was instrumental activity of daily living stage transitions (stable/improved function and functional deterioration), institutionalization, or mortality for 2 yrs of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 18 factors were identified for functional deterioration (P < 0.05). In the derivation cohort, the likelihood of functional deterioration ranged from 6.27% to 33.51%, risk of institutionalization from 0.07% to 12.13%, and risk of mortality from 2.13% to 31.83%, in comparison with stable/improved function.

"Hyalella azteca is a cryptic species complex of epibenthic amphipods of interest to ecotoxicology and evolutionary biology. It is the primary crustacean used in North America for sediment toxicity testing and an emerging model for molecular ecotoxicology. To provide molecular resources for sediment quality assessments and evolutionary studies, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genome of the H. azteca U.S. Lab Strain. The genome quality and completeness is comparable with other ecotoxicological model species. Through targeted investigation and use of gene expression data sets of H. azteca exposed to pesticides, metals, and other emerging contaminants, we annotated and characterized the major gene families involved in sequestration, detoxification, oxidative stress, and toxicant response. Our results revealed gene loss related to light sensing, but a large expansion in chemoreceptors, likely underlying sensory shifts necessary in their low light habitats. Gene family expansions were also noted for cytochrome P450 genes, cuticle proteins, ion transporters, and include recent gene duplications in the metal sequestration protein, metallothionein. Mapping of differentially expressed transcripts to the genome significantly increased the ability to functionally annotate toxicant responsive genes. The H. azteca genome will greatly facilitate development of genomic tools for environmental assessments and promote an understanding of how evolution shapes toxicological pathways with implications for environmental and human health.",The Toxicogenome of Hyalella azteca: A Model for Sediment Ecotoxicology and Evolutionary Toxicology.
"Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) and other interventions are rapidly evolving as a class of technologically driven interventional approaches in which many surgical specialties visualize fluorescent molecular tracers or biomarkers through associated cameras or oculars to guide clinical decisions on pathological lesion detection and excision/ablation. The technology has been commercialized for some specific applications, but also presents technical challenges unique to optical imaging that could confound the utility of some interventional procedures where real-time decisions must be made. Accordingly, the AAPM has initiated the publication of this Blue Paper of The Emerging Technology Working Group (TETAWG) and the creation of a Task Group from the Therapy Physics Committee within the Treatment Delivery Subcommittee. In describing the relevant issues, this document outlines the key parameters, stakeholders, impacts, and outcomes of clinical FGS technology and its applications. The presentation is not intended to be conclusive, but rather to inform the field of medical physics and stimulate the discussions needed in the field with respect to a seemingly low-risk imaging technology that has high potential for significant therapeutic impact.

"OBJECTIVE: The American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) provides guidelines to practitioners who interpret sonographic examinations of thyroid nodules. The purpose of this study is to compare the ACR TI-RADS system with two other well-established guidelines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ACR TI-RADS, the Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology (KSThR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS), and the American Thyroid Association guidelines were compared using 3422 thyroid nodules for which pathologic findings were available. The composition, echogenicity, margins, echogenic foci, and size of the nodules were assessed to determine whether a recommendation would be made for fine-needle aspiration or follow-up sonography when each system was used. The biopsy yield of malignant findings, the yield of follow-up, and the percentage of malignant and benign nodules that would be biopsied were determined for all nodules and for nodules 1 cm or larger. RESULTS: The percentage of nodules that could not be classified was 0%, 3.9%, and 13.9% for the ACR TI-RADS, KSThR TIRADS, and ATA guidelines, respectively. The biopsy yield of malignancy was 14.2%, 10.2%, and 10.0% for nodules assessed by the ACR TI-RADS, KSThR TIRADS, and ATA guidelines, respectively. The percentage of malignant nodules that were biopsied was 68.2%, 78.7%, and 75.9% for the ACR TI-RADS, the KSThR TIRADS, and the ATA guidelines, respectively, whereas the percentage of malignant nodules that would be either biopsied or followed was 89.2% for the ACR TI-RADS. The percentage of benign nodules that would be biopsied was 47.1%, 79.7%, and 78.1% for the ACR TI-RADS, the KSThR TIRADS, and the ATA guidelines, respectively. The percentage of benign nodules that would be either biopsied or followed was 65.2% for the ACR TI-RADS.

We described and evaluated the sequence of steps used to screen 7th- and 8th-grade students (N = 89) referred by school staff as candidates for an open trial of group-based Trauma and Grief Component Therapy for Adolescents (TGCTA; Saltzman et al., in press). We used t tests to compare included versus excluded students on PTS symptom and MG reaction scores (University of California at Los Angeles Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index; Grief Screening Scale) during the group screen, individual interview, and treatment-implementation phases. Logistic regressions tested the incremental utility of including measures of both trauma exposure and related emotional and conduct problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) in the screening battery. Results suggest that the group screen helped to detect mental health needs and that the individual interview further identified students with PTS and emotional problems. Conduct problems and trauma exposure predicted attrition among students who qualified for treatment. MG incrementally predicted students who advanced from the group screening to the individual interview, and trauma exposure incrementally predicted attrition from treatment. Findings yield implications for improving research and practice, including procedures for enhancing school-based referral, screening, assessment, and selection procedures.

"OBJECTIVES: To understand how people who inject drugs (PWID) experience skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and make decisions to seek or delay medical treatment. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews in 2015 with 19 PWID at a syringe exchange program in Philadelphia. We analyzed the data using standard qualitative techniques. RESULTS: PWID described adequate knowledge about SSTI, although they could not always implement knowledge about SSTI prevention due to environmental constraints. Participants reported different experiences with incident SSTI. Some sought immediate medical care at initial presentation. Most, however, waited to seek care. Previous positive and negative healthcare experiences, both in general -including stigma and withdrawal- and specific to SSTI, influenced this decision. Among those who delayed medical care, some reported self-treatment, including increased drug use for pain control, and lancing and draining their own wounds. CONCLUSION: Reducing the incidence of SSTI and promoting earlier treatment are important public health priorities. Both require ongoing attention and improvements to the environments in which PWID inject and receive care.",Experiences with skin and soft tissue infections among people who inject drugs in Philadelphia: A qualitative study.
"The baby brain is constantly changing due to its active neurodevelopment, and research into the baby brain is one of the frontiers in neuroscience. To help guide neuroscientists and clinicians in their investigation of this frontier, maps of the baby brain, which contain a priori knowledge about neurodevelopment and anatomy, are essential. ""Brain atlas"" in this review refers to a 3D-brain image with a set of reference labels, such as a parcellation map, as the anatomical reference that guides the mapping of the brain. Recent advancements in scanners, sequences, and motion control methodologies enable the creation of various types of high-resolution baby brain atlases. What is becoming clear is that one atlas is not sufficient to characterize the existing knowledge about the anatomical variations, disease-related anatomical alterations, and the variations in time-dependent changes. In this review, the types and roles of the human baby brain MRI atlases that are currently available are described and discussed, and future directions in the field of developmental neuroscience and its clinical applications are proposed. The potential use of disease-based atlases to characterize clinically relevant information, such as clinical labels, in addition to conventional anatomical labels, is also discussed.",Baby brain atlases.
"Modern triple quadrupole mass spectrometers provide the ability to detect and quantify a large number of metabolites using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Liquid chromatography (LC) is advantageous, as it does not require derivatization procedures and a large diversity in physiochemical characteristics of analytes can be accommodated through a variety of column chemistries. Recently, the comprehensive optimization of LC-MS metabolomics using design of experiments (COLMeD) approach has been described and used by our group to develop robust LC-MS workflows (Rhoades and Weljie, 2016). The optimized LC-MS/MS method described here has been utilized extensively for metabolomics analysis of polar metabolites. Typically, tissue or biofluid samples are extracted using a modified Bligh-Dyer protocol (Bligh and Dyer, 1959; Tambellini et al., 2013). The protocol described herein describes this workflow using targeted polar metabolite multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) from tissues and biofluids via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). This workflow has been utilized extensively for chronometabolic analysis (Krishnaiah et al., 2017), with applications generalized to other types of analyses as well (Sengupta et al., 2017; Sivanand et al., 2017).",Extraction and Analysis of Pan-metabolome Polar Metabolites by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).

"Community stakeholders, researchers, and providers are increasingly focused on individual, family, and systemic factors that contribute to positive outcomes for adults on the autism spectrum. Parent expectations for their youth's future are associated with adult outcomes (e.g., employment, school success, independence), yet the mechanism for this effect remains unclear. This study investigated how expectations were related to parent transition-related activities in a sample of 298 parents of adolescents on the autism spectrum (48% female adolescents), stratified by parent-reported IQ (average or above, borderline, or below 70). Parent expectations for the future predicted engagement in some activities intended to enhance adult outcomes when controlling for IQ, gender, age, and household income. The results have implications for how providers discuss expectations and support families in preparing for adulthood.",Parent Expectations and Preparatory Activities as Adolescents with ASD Transition to Adulthood.
"Immunotherapies have led to the successful development of novel therapies for cancer. However, there is increasing concern regarding the adverse effects caused by non-tumor-specific immune responses. Here, we report an effective strategy to generate high-avidity tumor-antigen-specific CTLs, using Cas9/single-guide RNA (sgRNA) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we selected the gp100 melanoma-associated tumor antigen, and cloned the gp100-specific high-avidity TCR from gp100-immunized mice. To enable rapid structural dissection of the TCR, we developed a 3D protein structure modeling system for the TCR/antigen-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) interaction. Combining these technologies, we efficiently generated gp100-specific PD-1(-) CD8+ T cells, and demonstrated that the genetically engineered CD8+ T cells have high avidity against melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our methodology offers computational prediction of the TCR response, and enables efficient generation of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that can neutralize tumor-induced immune suppression leading to a potentially powerful cancer therapeutic.",Generation of tumor antigen-specific murine CD8+ T cells with enhanced anti-tumor activity via highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.

"BACKGROUND: Recommended durations of observation after anaphylaxis have been widely variable, with many ranging from 4 to 24 hours. Prolonged durations often prompt admission for ongoing observation. METHODS: In a multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative, we revised our emergency department (ED) anaphylaxis clinical pathway. Our primary aim was to safely decrease the recommended length of observation from 8 to 4 hours and thereby decrease unnecessary hospitalizations. Secondary aims included provider education on anaphylaxis diagnostic criteria, emphasizing epinephrine as first-line therapy, and implementing a practice of discharging ED patients with an epinephrine autoinjector in hand. The study period consisted of the 18 months before pathway revision (baseline) and the 18 months after revision. RESULTS: The overall admission rate decreased from 58.2% (106 of 182) in the baseline period to 25.3% (65 of 257) after pathway revision (P < .0001). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients returning to the ED within 72 hours, and there were no adverse outcomes or deaths throughout the study period. After pathway revision, the median time to first epinephrine administration for the most critical patients was 10 minutes, and 85.4% (164 of 192) of patients were discharged with an epinephrine autoinjector in hand. CONCLUSIONS: By revising an anaphylaxis clinical pathway, we were able to streamline the care of patients with anaphylaxis presenting to a busy pediatric ED, without any compromise in safety. Most notably, decreasing the recommended length of observation from 8 to 4 hours resulted in a near 60% reduction in the average rate of admission.",Improving Anaphylaxis Care: The Impact of a Clinical Pathway.
"Allergic contact dermatitis is associated with significant disease and economic burden in the United States. To properly manage allergic contact dermatitis, it is important to accurately identify the substance(s) implicated in the dermatitis to prevent disease recurrence. The commercially available T.R.U.E Test (36 allergens) screening panel has been reported to have a conservative hypothetical allergen detection rate of 66.0%, at most. Importantly, these calculations are based on the 78% of patients who had clinically relevant reactions to allergens present on the North American Contact Dermatitis Group screening series (70 allergens), without the use of supplemental allergens. Testing with supplemental allergens beyond a screening series can more fully evaluate an individual's environmental and occupational exposure, which may significantly increase diagnostic accuracy. Comprehensive patch testing with additional allergens in sunscreens, cosmetics, and fragrances, for example, may increase the diagnostic yield as well as the likelihood of achieving a cure if the dermatitis is chronic and recalcitrant.",The Medical Necessity of Comprehensive Patch Testing.
"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure of unknown cause. IIH has been shown to be associated with female sex as well as obesity. This genome-wide association study was performed to determine whether genetic variants are associated with this condition. METHODS: We analyzed the chromosomal DNA of 95 patients with IIH enrolled in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial and 95 controls matched on sex, body mass index, and self-reported ethnicity. The samples were genotyped using Illumina Infinium HumanCoreExome v1-0 array and analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model that accounted for population stratification using multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: A total of 301,908 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated. The strongest associations observed were for rs2234671 on chromosome 2 (P = 4.93 x 10), rs79642714 on chromosome 6 (P = 2.12 x 10), and rs200288366 on chromosome 12 (P = 6.23 x 10). In addition, 3 candidate regions marked by multiple associated SNPs were identified on chromosome 5, 13, and 14. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the genetics of IIH in a rigorously characterized cohort. The study was limited by its modest size and thus would have only been able to demonstrate highly significant association on a genome-wide scale for relatively common alleles exerting large effects. However, several variants and loci were identified that might be strong candidates for follow-up studies in other well-phenotyped cohorts.",Genetic Survey of Adult-Onset Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to review the most recent literature regarding diagnostic stability of mood disorders, focusing on epidemiological, clinical-psychopathological, and neurobiological data for unipolar and bipolar affective disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Unipolar depression follows a chronic course in at least half of all cases and presents a considerable diagnostic stability across all age ranges. Studies using latent class analysis are allowing improved profiling of depressive subtypes and assessment of their prevalence. Advances have been made in our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of depression, with data highlighting the roles of amyloid deposits, the ApoE4 allele, and atrophy of the anterior hippocampus or frontal cortex. The diagnostic instability of bipolar disorder is manifest in the early years, seen in both the extent of diagnostic delay and the high rate of diagnostic conversion from unipolar depression. Regarding disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, we have little data to date, but those which exist indicate a high rate of comorbidity and minimal diagnostic stability for this disorder. Diagnostic stability varies substantially among mood disorders, which would be related to the validity of current diagnostic categories and our diagnostic accuracy.",A Review on the General Stability of Mood Disorder Diagnoses Along the Lifetime.
"Neurologic conditions associated with HIV remain major contributors to morbidity and mortality, and are increasingly recognized in the aging population on long-standing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Importantly, growing evidence suggests that the central nervous system (CNS) serves as a reservoir for viral replication with major implications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) eradication strategies. Though there has been major progress in the last decade in our understanding of the pathogenesis, burden, and impact of HIV-associated neurologic conditions, significant scientific gaps remain. In many low-income settings, second- and third-line cART regimens that carry substantial neurotoxicity remain treatment mainstays. Further, patients continue to present severely immunosuppressed with CNS opportunistic infections. Public health efforts should emphasize improvements in access and optimizing treatment of HIV-positive patients, specifically in resource-limited settings, to reduce the risk of neurologic sequelae.",Global developments in HIV neurology.
"T-regulatory (Treg) cells are like other cells present throughout the body in being subject to biochemical modifications in response to extracellular signals. An important component of these responses involves changes in posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of histones and many nonhistone proteins, including phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, ubiquitination/deubiquitination, and acetylation/deacetylation. Foxp3, the key transcription factor of Tregs, is constantly being rapidly turned over, and a number of these PTMs determine its level of expression and activity. Of interest in the transplant setting, modulation of the acetylation or deacetylation of key lysine residues in Foxp3 can promote the stability and function, leading to increased Treg production and increased Treg suppressive activity. This mini-review focuses on recent data concerning the roles that histone/protein deacetylases (HDACs) play in control of Treg function, and how small molecule HDAC inhibitors can be used to promote Treg-dependent allograft survival in experimental models. These data are discussed in the light of increasing interest in the identification and clinical evaluation of isoform-selective HDAC inhibitors, and their potential application as tools to modulate Foxp3+ Treg cell numbers and function in transplant recipients.",Histone/protein deacetylase inhibitor therapy for enhancement of Foxp3+ T-regulatory cell function posttransplantation.
"Children in immigrant families are less likely to screen positive with the Children with Special Health Care Needs Screener (CSHCN-S). This may indicate that children in immigrant families are healthier or require fewer health services than non-immigrant peers. Alternatively, the screener may under-identify special healthcare needs in this population. Using the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health, we examined the prevalence of a positive CSHCN-S among children from first, second, and third generation households with an equivalent number of currently diagnosed chronic conditions (0, 1, 2+). Multivariate analyses controlled for sociodemographic factors. Among children with an equivalent number of chronic conditions, fewer children from first and second generation households screened positive with the CSHCN-S relative to children from third generation households. This association remained after adjusting for covariates. The CSHCN Screener may under-identify children from immigrant households, allowing for missed opportunities to allocate health resources.",Using the Children with Special Health Care Needs Screener with Immigrant Families: An Analysis of the National Survey of Children's Health.

"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic condition with potentially severe health and social consequences. Many who develop moderate to severe OUD will repeatedly seek treatment or interact with medical care via emergency department visits or hospitalizations. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop feasible and effective approaches to help persons with OUD achieve and maintain abstinence from opioids. Treatment that includes one of the three FDA-approved medications is an evidence-based strategy to manage OUD. The purpose of this review is to address practices for managing persons with moderate to severe OUD with a focus on opioid withdrawal and naltrexone-based relapse-prevention treatment. METHODS: Literature available on PubMed was used to review the evolution of treatment strategies from the 1960s onward to manage opioid withdrawal and initiate treatment with naltrexone. RESULTS: Emerging practices for extended-release naltrexone induction include the use of agonist tapers and adjuvant medications. Clinical challenges frequently encountered when initiating this therapy include managing withdrawal and ongoing opioid use during treatment. Clinical factors may inform decisions regarding patient selection and length of naltrexone treatment, such as recent opioid use and patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Treatment strategies to manage opioid withdrawal have evolved, but many patients with OUD do not receive medication for the prevention of relapse. Clinical strategies for induction onto extended-release naltrexone are now available and can be safely and effectively implemented in specialty and select primary care settings.

"Study Objectives: Sleep deprivation is associated with impaired immune responses, cancer, and morbidity and mortality, and can degrade cognitive performance, although individual differences exist in such responses. Sleep deprivation induces DNA strand breaks and DNA base oxidation in animals, and psychological stress is associated with increased DNA damage in humans. It remains unknown whether sleep deprivation or psychological stress in humans affects DNA damage response from environmental stressors, and whether these responses predict cognitive performance during sleep deprivation. Methods: Sixteen healthy adults (ages 29-52 years; mean age +/- SD, 36.4 +/- 7.1 years; seven women) participated in a 5-day experiment involving two 8 hr time-in-bed (TIB) baseline nights, followed by 39 hr total sleep deprivation (TSD), and two 8-10 hr TIB recovery nights. A modified Trier Social Stress Test was conducted on the day after TSD. The Psychomotor Vigilance Test measured behavioral attention. DNA damage was assessed in blood cells collected at 5 time points, and blood cells were irradiated ex vivo. Results: TSD, alone or in combination with psychological stress, did not induce significant increases in DNA damage. By contrast, radiation-induced DNA damage decreased significantly in response to TSD, but increased back to baseline when combined with psychological stress. Cognitively vulnerable individuals had more radiation-induced DNA strand breaks before TSD, indicating their greater sensitivity to DNA damage from environmental stressors. Conclusions: Our results provide novel insights into the molecular consequences of sleep deprivation, psychological stress, and performance vulnerability. They are important for fields involving sleep loss, radiation exposure, and cognitive deficits, including cancer therapy, environmental toxicology, and space medicine.",The degree of radiation-induced DNA strand breaks is altered by acute sleep deprivation and psychological stress and is associated with cognitive performance in humans.
"Parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer must acquire new knowledge and skills in order to safely care for their child at home. Institutional variation exists in the methods and content used by nurses in providing the initial education. The goal of this project was to develop a checklist, standardized across institutions, to guide nursing education provided to parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer. A team of 21 members (19 nurses and 2 parent advocates) used current hospital educational checklists, expert consensus recommendations, and a series of iterative activities and discussions to develop one standardized checklist. The final checklist specifies primary topics that are essential to teach prior to the initial hospital discharge, secondary topics that should be discussed within the first month after the cancer diagnosis, and tertiary topics that should be discussed prior to completion of therapy. This checklist is designed to guide education and will set the stage for future studies to identify effective teaching strategies that optimize the educational process for parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer.",A Standardized Education Checklist for Parents of Children Newly Diagnosed With Cancer: A Report From the Children's Oncology Group.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There has been growing clinical and research attention to the unique developmental stage of emerging adulthood. This stage is a time of significant change and growth for all individuals, as it includes identity exploration, emotional, behavioral, and financial independence from caregivers, and completion of educational or vocational requirements.

"Neuroblastoma, a malignancy of the developing peripheral nervous system that affects infants and young children, is a complex genetic disease. Over the past two decades, significant progress has been made toward understanding the genetic determinants that predispose to this often lethal childhood cancer. Approximately 1-2% of neuroblastomas are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and a combination of co-morbidity and linkage studies has led to the identification of germline mutations in PHOX2B and ALK as the major genetic contributors to this familial neuroblastoma subset. The genetic basis of ""sporadic"" neuroblastoma is being studied through a large genome-wide association study (GWAS). These efforts have led to the discovery of many common susceptibility alleles, each with modest effect size, associated with the development and progression of sporadic neuroblastoma. More recently, next-generation sequencing efforts have expanded the list of potential neuroblastoma-predisposing mutations to include rare germline variants with a predicted larger effect size. The evolving characterization of neuroblastoma's genetic basis has led to a deeper understanding of the molecular events driving tumorigenesis, more precise risk stratification and prognostics and novel therapeutic strategies. This review details the contemporary understanding of neuroblastoma's genetic predisposition, including recent advances and discusses ongoing efforts to address gaps in our knowledge regarding this malignancy's complex genetic underpinnings.",Genetic susceptibility to neuroblastoma: current knowledge and future directions.
"General anesthetics are small molecules that interact with and effect the function of many different proteins to promote loss of consciousness, amnesia, and sometimes, analgesia. Owing to the complexity of this state transition and the transient nature of these drug/protein interactions, anesthetics can be difficult to study. The zebrafish is an emerging model for the discovery of both new genes required for the response to and side effects of anesthesia. Here we discuss the tools available to manipulate the zebrafish genome, including both genetic screens and genome engineering approaches. Additionally, there are various robust behavior assays available to study anesthetic and other drug responses. These assays are available for single-gene study or high throughput for genetic or drug discovery. Finally, we present a case study of using propofol as an anesthetic in the zebrafish. These techniques and protocols make the zebrafish a powerful model to study anesthetic mechanisms and drug discovery.",Zebrafish: A Pharmacogenetic Model for Anesthesia.

"Kingella kingae is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that is increasingly being recognized as an important cause of invasive disease in young children. The pathogenesis of K. kingae disease begins with colonization of the oropharynx, followed by invasion of the bloodstream, survival in the intravascular space, and dissemination to distant sites. Recent studies have revealed that K. kingae produces a number of surface factors that may contribute to the pathogenic process, including a polysaccharide capsule and an exopolysaccharide. In this study, we observed that K. kingae was highly resistant to the bactericidal effects of human serum complement. Using mutant strains deficient in expression of capsule, exopolysaccharide, or both in assays with human serum, we found that elimination of both capsule and exopolysaccharide was required for efficient binding of IgG, IgM, C4b, and C3b to the bacterial surface and for complement-mediated killing. Abrogation of the classical complement pathway using EGTA-treated human serum restored survival to wild-type levels by the mutant lacking both capsule and exopolysaccharide, demonstrating that capsule and exopolysaccharide promote resistance to the classical complement pathway. Consistent with these results, loss of both capsule and exopolysaccharide eliminated invasive disease in juvenile rats with an intact complement system but not in rats lacking complement. Based on these observations, we conclude that the capsule and the exopolysaccharide have important redundant roles in promoting survival of K. kingae in human serum. Each of these surface factors is sufficient by itself to fully prevent serum opsonin deposition and complement-mediated killing of K. kingae, ultimately facilitating intravascular survival and promoting K. kingae invasive disease.",Kingella kingae Surface Polysaccharides Promote Resistance to Human Serum and Virulence in a Juvenile Rat Model.
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves progressive deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), synapse loss, and neuronal death, which occur in brain regions critical for learning and memory. Considerable evidence suggests that lipid peroxidation contributes to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal degeneration, both upstream and downstream of Abeta pathology. Recent findings suggest that lipid peroxidation can be inhibited by replacement of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with isotope-reinforced (deuterated) PUFA (D-PUFA), and that D-PUFA can protect neurons in experimental models of Parkinson's disease. Here, we determined whether dietary D-PUFA would ameliorate Abeta pathology and/or cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD (amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 double mutant transgenic mice). The D-PUFA diet did not ameliorate spatial learning and memory deficits in the AD mice. Compared to mice fed an hydrogenated-PUFA control diet, those fed D-PUFA for 5 months exhibited high levels of incorporation of deuterium into arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, and reduced concentrations of lipid peroxidation products (F2 isoprostanes and neuroprostanes), in the brain tissues. Concentrations of Abeta40 and Abeta38 in the hippocampus were significantly lower, with a trend to reduced concentrations of Abeta42, in mice fed D-PUFA compared to those fed hydrogenated-PUFA. We conclude that a D-PUFA diet reduces the brain tissue concentrations of both arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid oxidation products, as well as the concentration of Abetas.","Deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce brain lipid peroxidation and hippocampal amyloid beta-peptide levels, without discernable behavioral effects in an APP/PS1 mutant transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease."
"BACKGROUND: Although studies have analyzed quality of life in children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, to date nobody has investigated long-term quality of life in adults with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. The purpose of this study was to compare quality of life in adult nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients with a cohort of unaffected controls. METHODS: The authors queried their institution's prospectively maintained craniofacial registry for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients aged 18 years and older, and administered the validated World Health Organization Quality of Life Biomedical Research and Education Foundation questionnaire. Responses were compared, using a two-sample t test, to an age-matched U.S. normative database provided by the World Health Organization. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one adults met inclusion criteria: 52 were successfully contacted and 32 completed the questionnaire. Average age of respondents was 23.0 +/- 6.1 years (range, 18.1 to 42.1 years). Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients had a superior quality of life compared with comparative norms in all domains: physical health (17.8 +/- 2.7 versus 15.5 +/- 3.2; p < 0.001), psychological (16.3 +/- 2.9 versus 13.8 +/- 3.2; p < 0.001), social (16.9 +/- 2.6 versus 13.2 +/- 3.6; p < 0.001), and environmental (17.2 +/- 2.5 versus 11.7 +/- 2.7; p < 0.001). Comparison between single-suture subtypes revealed no difference in any quality-of-life domain (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients previously treated for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis perceive their quality of life to be high, superior to that of a normative U.S. SAMPLE: Future work will seek to analyze additional patients and better understand the reasons behind these findings.",Quality of Life in Adults with Nonsyndromic Craniosynostosis.
"INTRODUCTION: Ectopic thymic tissue can arise as an asymptomatic neck mass, which may be detected on imaging studies. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of ectopic thymic tissue in paediatric FNAs and to the correlate clinical, radiological and cytomorphological findings. METHODS: FNAs in children with neck and mediastinal lesions performed between January 2012 and July 2016 were reviewed for cases of ectopic thymus. These were then evaluated and correlated with the cytology findings. RESULTS: Of 739 FNAs, 13 (1.8%) cases from 11 patients showed ectopic thymic tissue. The targeted lesions were in the thyroid (n = 7), submandibular region (n = 1), superior mediastinum (n = 1) and paratracheal region (n = 1). The most common indication was for microcalcifications concerning for papillary thyroid carcinoma on ultrasound (n = 6). Imaging findings included fusiform lesions with linear and punctuate bright echoes. The cytology evaluation showed small lymphocytes with discohesive epithelioid cells in most cases, and proteinaceous fluid in the cystic case. There were rare macrophages and Hassall's corpuscles. Flow cytometry and/or immunostains were performed in all cases, supporting thymic origin. CONCLUSION: Ectopic thymic tissue is rarely present as a neck mass or thyroid nodule on FNA biopsy. The ultrasound imaging findings reveal a well-defined fusiform lesion with punctate bright echoes that could be misinterpreted as papillary thyroid carcinoma. The aspirates show a small lymphoid population, immunophenotypically compatible with thymic T-cells, in addition to scattered epithelial cells. Therefore, knowledge of the typical ultrasonographic and cytopathological features can help make a definitive diagnosis and avoid more invasive procedures in paediatric patients.",Cytomorphology and sonographic features of ectopic thymic tissue diagnosed in paediatric FNA biopsies.
"BACKGROUND: Tearing and conjunctivitis in children are commonly due to lacrimal drainage system obstruction. Congenital nasolacrimal obstruction is a common pathology treated by probing with or without silicone stent insertion, depending upon the age of the child. The silicone stent is self-retaining and placed for at least one month. Masterka((R)) is a recent version of Monoka((R)), which may lead to the same surgical complications, such as intralacrimal migration. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The medical records of two patients surgically treated with the Masterka((R)) probe for nasolacrimal duct obstruction, who developed intralacrimal migration of the stent, were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. A 41-month-old child and an 18-month-old child presented with disappearance of the silicone tube after 7 days and 2 years respectively. In the first case, the tube migrated completely within the lacrimal system and became externalized through the nose at 2 years, while in the second case, the Masterka((R)) was retrieved through a canalicular approach. In both cases, infants had no further tearing. DISCUSSION: The frequency self-retaining stent disappearance is estimated at 15%. Among these cases, intralacrimal migration is only reported in 0.5% of cases. To prevent intralacrimal migration, the surgical technique must follow a certain number of rules. Management, based on residual epiphora, is discussed. CONCLUSION: Prevention of intralacrimal migration of self-retaining stents involves a rigorous analysis of the relationship between the meatus and the fixation head at the time of placement.

"Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable parameters of a system to its input-output response. To that end, we present a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains, but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and [EC50]. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors that enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.",Tuning Transcriptional Regulation through Signaling: A Predictive Theory of Allosteric Induction.
"BACKGROUND: Contrary to prevailing notions of uniform efficacy regarding stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a recent report has indicated increased risk of local failure for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). As those data have not been corroborated by other studies, we performed a multi-institutional analysis to evaluate the influence of histology on post-SBRT outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records from 152 consecutive patients who received SBRT for primary early-stage NSCLC at two academic medical centers were retrospectively assessed. Primary comparison was between SCC and adenocarcinoma. Patient outcomes including actuarial recurrences and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses addressed associated factors. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 44 months, patients with SCC had an increased risk of local, (hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.69 (1.05-2.73), p=0.032), regional (HR (95% CI): 2.03 (1.24-3.33), p=0.005), and distant failure (HR (95% CI): 1.71 (1.06-2.77), p=0.036). Median times to local (32 m vs 50m, p=0.023), regional (26m vs 50m, p=0.011), and distant (26m vs 50m, p=0.024) failure were all significantly reduced in SCC histology. SCC histology was also independently associated with an increased risk for death (HR: 1.80 (1.10-2.94), p=0.019) and had a 5-yr overall survival of 26%, versus 41% for adenocarcinoma (p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: This multi-institutional analysis corroborates that SCC histology is independently predictive for local, regional, and distant recurrence and worse overall survival. Future data are needed to determine if treatment paradigms should differ by histology for early stage NSCLC.",Histology significantly affects recurrence and survival following SBRT for early stage non-small cell lung cancer.
"Laryngotracheoesophageal cleft (LTEC) is a rare anatomic cause of aspiration in the newborn and infant. The clinical presentation of infants with LTEC is variable and will usually vary with the degree of anatomic communication between the airway and esophagus. The diagnosis of LTEC is often challenging, particularly in cases where the presentation and pathology are more subtle. Management of LTEC depends upon the clinical presentation, degree of aspiration, and anatomic depth of the cleft. The goal of this review is to present the clinician with a practical approach to diagnosis and management of this rare but challenging congenital airway anomaly.",Diagnosis and Management of Laryngotracheoesophageal Cleft.
"Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP) play an integral role in evaluating and treating pediatric patients with dysphagia related to aerodigestive disorders. Non-supportive anatomy, cardio-respiratory and medical status, state control, neurologic functioning, postural stability and control, gastrointestinal functioning, hunger and satiation, developmental abilities, oral-motor skills, oral/pharyngeal reflexes, airway protection and secretion management can create barriers to successful oral feeding. Swallowing is broken down into four phases and difficulties can occur during any phase or in combination with another phase of swallowing. Dysphagia is diagnosed by both clinical and instrumental evaluation. Objective evaluations of swallowing include the Video Fluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) and Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). A Video Fluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) is a radiographic study assessing oropharyngeal swallow function. The Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) is conducted by passing a laryngoscope through the nose to just below the soft palate for a ""bird's eye view"" of laryngeal anatomy and swallow function. Following a diagnosis of dysphagia from either a clinical or instrumental assessment, there are a variety of avenues that can be pursued including diet modifications, compensatory strategies, and use of specialized equipment to ensure a safe feeding plan and reduce the risk of aspiration. In conclusion, through numerous evaluation and intervention approaches, the contributions of SLPs helps provide input for well-rounded, multi-disciplinary plans supporting successful oral feeding.",Dysphagia in Children.
"Parents' perceptions of child behavior influence their responses to the child and may be important predictors of physical abuse. We examined whether infants 12 months of age or younger who were described with negative or developmentally unrealistic words were more likely than other infants to have been physically abused. As part of a prospective observational multicenter study investigating bruising and familial psychosocial characteristics, parents were asked to (1) describe their child's personality, and (2) list three words to describe their child. Four independent raters coded parent responses using a qualitative content analysis, identifying descriptors of infants and classifying each as positive, neutral, or negative/unrealistic. A medical expert panel, blinded to the psychosocial data, separately categorized each case as abuse or accident. We then analyzed the potential association between negative/unrealistic descriptors and abusive injury. Of 185 children enrolled, 147 cases (79%) were categorized as accident and 38 (21%) as abuse. Parents used at least one negative/unrealistic descriptor in 35/185 cases (19%), while the remaining 150 cases (81%) included only positive or neutral descriptors. Of the infants described with negative/unrealistic words, 60% were abused, compared to 11% of those described with positive or neutral words (p<.0001; age group-adjusted OR=9.95; 95% confidence interval [3.98, 24.90]). Though limited by sample-size, this pilot study informs future work to create a screening tool utilizing negative/unrealistic descriptors in combination with other predictive factors to identify infants at high risk for physical child abuse.",Are negative/unrealistic parent descriptors of infant attributes associated with physical abuse?

"Objective: To update the ""Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes"" guideline published in 2010. Participants: The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist. Evidence: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies. Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline. Conclusions: We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g., African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.",Testosterone Therapy in Men With Hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline.
"The success of immune checkpoint blockade in patients with a wide variety of malignancies has changed the treatment paradigm in oncology. However, combination therapies with immune checkpoint blockade will be needed to overcome resistance and broaden the clinical utility of immunotherapy. Here we discuss a framework for rationally designing combination therapy strategies based on enhancing major discriminatory functions of the immune system that are corrupted by cancer-namely, antigenicity, adjuvanticity, and homeostatic feedback inhibition. We review recent advances on how conventional genotoxic cancer therapies, molecularly targeted therapies, epigenetic agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors can restore these discriminatory functions. Potential barriers that can impede response despite combination therapy are also discussed.",Combination Cancer Therapy with Immune Checkpoint Blockade: Mechanisms and Strategies.
"In Parkinson's disease (PD), the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) leads to severe motor impairment, and pathological inclusions known as Lewy bodies contain aggregated alpha-synuclein protein. The relationship of alpha-synuclein aggregation and dopaminergic degeneration is unclear. This commentary highlights a recent study showing that the interaction of alpha-synuclein with dopamine may be an important mechanism underlying disease. Elevating dopamine levels in mice expressing human alpha-synuclein with the A53T familial PD mutation recapitulated key features of PD, including progressive neurodegeneration of the SN and decreased ambulation. The toxicity of dopamine was dependent on alpha-synuclein expression; hence, raising dopamine levels in nontransgenic mice did not result in neuronal injury. This interaction is likely mediated through soluble alpha-synuclein oligomers, which had modified conformations and were more abundant as a result of dopamine elevation in the mouse brain. Specific mutation of the dopamine interaction motif in the C-terminus of alpha-synuclein rescued dopamine neurons from degeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans models. Here, these findings are discussed, particularly regarding possible mechanisms of oligomer toxicity, relevance of these models to sporadic and autosomal recessive forms of PD, and implications for current PD treatment.",The Convergence of Dopamine and alpha-Synuclein: Implications for Parkinson's Disease.
"Although home visiting has been used in many populations in prevention efforts, the impact of scaled-up home-visiting programs on abuse and neglect remains unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of voluntary participation in an established statewide home-visiting program for socially high-risk families on child maltreatment as identified by Child Protective Services (CPS). Propensity score matching was used to compare socially high-risk families with a child born between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2011 who participated in Connecticut's home-visiting program for first-time mothers and a comparison cohort of families who were eligible for the home-visiting program but did not participate. The main outcomes were child maltreatment investigations, substantiations, and out-of-home placements by CPS between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2013. In the unmatched sample, families who participated in home-visiting had significantly higher median risk scores (P<.001). After matching families on measured confounders, the percentages of families with CPS investigations (21.1% vs. 20.9%, P=.86) were similar between the two groups. However, there was a 22% decreased likelihood of CPS substantiations (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.95) for families receiving home visiting. First substantiations also occurred later in the child's life among home-visited families. There was a trend toward decreased out-of-home placement (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53-1.02, P=.06). These results from a scaled-up statewide program highlight the potential of home visiting as an important approach to preventing child abuse and neglect.",Preventing child maltreatment: Examination of an established statewide home-visiting program.

"Ligamentous injuries of the pediatric wrist, once thought to be relatively uncommon, are increasingly recognized in the context of acute high-energy mechanism trauma and chronic axial loading, including those encountered in both recreational and high-performance competitive sports. Recent advances in MR-based techniques for imaging the pediatric wrist allow for sensitive identification of these often radiographically occult injuries. Detailed knowledge of the intrinsic and supportive extrinsic ligamentous complexes, as well as normal developmental anatomy and congenital variation, are essential to accurately diagnose injuries to these structures. Early identification of ligamentous injury of the pediatric wrist is essential within the conservative treatment culture of modern pediatric orthopedics because treatment of these lesions often necessitates surgery, and outcomes often depend on early and sometimes aggressive intervention. In this article, we review MR arthrogram technique and pediatric wrist anatomy, and correlate appearances on MR and selected ligamentous pathologies of the pediatric wrist.",Anatomy and injuries of the pediatric wrist: beyond the basics.

"Genetic etiology of psychopathology symptoms and cognitive performance in schizophrenia is supported by candidate gene and polygenic risk score (PRS) association studies. Such associations are reported to be dependent on several factors - sample characteristics, illness phase, illness severity etc. We aimed to examine if schizophrenia PRS predicted psychopathology symptoms and cognitive performance in patients with chronic schizophrenia. We also examined if schizophrenia associated autosomal loci were associated with specific symptoms or cognitive domains. Case-only analysis using data from the Clinical Antipsychotics Trials of Intervention Effectiveness-Schizophrenia trials (n=730). PRS was constructed using Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) leave one out genome wide association analysis as the discovery data set. For candidate region analysis, we selected 105-schizophrenia associated autosomal loci from the PGC study. We found a significant effect of PRS on positive symptoms at p-threshold (PT ) of 0.5 (R(2)=0.007, p=0.029, empirical p=0.029) and negative symptoms at PT of 1e-07 (R(2)=0.005, p=0.047, empirical p=0.048). For models that additionally controlled for neurocognition, best fit PRS predicted positive (p-threshold 0.01, R(2)=0.007, p=0.013, empirical p=0.167) and negative symptoms (p-threshold 0.1, R(2)=0.012, p=0.004, empirical p=0.329). No associations were seen for overall neurocognitive and social cognitive performance tests. Post-hoc analyses revealed that PRS predicted working memory and vigilance performance but did not survive correction. No candidate regions that survived multiple testing corrections were associated with either symptoms or cognitive performance. Our findings point to potentially distinct pathogenic mechanisms for schizophrenia symptoms.",Polygenic signal for symptom dimensions and cognitive performance in patients with chronic schizophrenia.

"The relationship between fat, bone and systemic metabolism is a growing area of scientific interest. Marrow adipose tissue is a well-recognized component of the bone marrow milieu and is metabolically distinct from current established subtypes of adipose tissue. Despite recent advances, the functional significance of marrow adipose tissue is still not clearly delineated. Bone and fat cells share a common mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) within the bone marrow, and hormones and transcription factors such as growth hormone, leptin, and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma influence MSC differentiation into osteoblasts or adipocytes. MSC osteogenic potential is more vulnerable than adipogenic potential to radiation and chemotherapy, and this confers a risk for an abnormal fat-bone axis in survivors following cancer therapy and bone marrow transplantation. This review provides a summary of data from animal and human studies describing the relationship between marrow adipose tissue and hematopoiesis, bone mineral density, bone strength, and metabolic function. The significance of marrow adiposity in other metabolic disorders such as osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and estrogen and growth hormone deficiency are also discussed. We conclude that marrow adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ with important metabolic functions contributing to bone energy maintenance, osteogenesis, bone remodeling, and hematopoiesis. Future studies on the metabolic role of marrow adipose tissue may provide the critical insight necessary for selecting targeted therapeutic interventions to improve altered hematopoiesis and augment skeletal remodeling in cancer survivors.",Fat-bone interaction within the bone marrow milieu: Impact on hematopoiesis and systemic energy metabolism.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is characterized by a heterogenic phenotype, including hearing loss. The underlying cause of hearing loss, especially sensorineural hearing loss, is not yet clear. Therefore, our objective was to describe anatomic malformations in the middle and inner ear in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case series was conducted in 2 tertiary referral centers. All patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome who had undergone CT or MR imaging of the temporal bones were included. Radiologic images were evaluated on predetermined parameters, including abnormalities of the ossicular chain, cochlea, semicircular canals, and vestibule. RESULTS: There were 26 patients (52 ears) with a CT or MR imaging scan available. A dense stapes superstructure was found in 18 ears (36%), an incomplete partition type II was suspected in 12 cochleas (23%), the lateral semicircular canal was malformed with a small bony island in 17 ears (33%), and the lateral semicircular canal and vestibule were fused to a single cavity in 15 ears (29%).

"Tumor suppressor genes play critical roles orchestrating anti-cancer programs that are both context dependent and mechanistically diverse. Beyond canonical tumor suppressive programs that control cell division, cell death, and genome stability, unexpected tumor suppressor gene activities that regulate metabolism, immune surveillance, the epigenetic landscape, and others have recently emerged. This diversity underscores the important roles these genes play in maintaining cellular homeostasis to suppress cancer initiation and progression, but also highlights a tremendous challenge in discerning precise context-specific programs of tumor suppression controlled by a given tumor suppressor. Fortunately, the rapid sophistication of genetically engineered mouse models of cancer has begun to shed light on these context-dependent tumor suppressor activities. By using techniques that not only toggle ""off"" tumor suppressor genes in nascent tumors, but also facilitate the timely restoration of gene function ""back-on again"" in disease specific contexts, precise mechanisms of tumor suppression can be revealed in an unbiased manner. This review discusses the development and implementation of genetic systems designed to toggle tumor suppressor genes off and back-on again and their potential to uncover the tumor suppressor's tale.",Off and back-on again: a tumor suppressor's tale.
"Academic medical center (AMC) faculty, administrators, and leaders have the critical tasks of teaching and training the next generation of health care providers and biomedical researchers, as well as generating new knowledge that improves the health of all. In the United States, medical schools and their affiliated hospitals train remarkably high-quality physicians and scientists, and the research conducted at these institutions results in advances in health. To that end, AMCs have become essential engines for driving better health in the United States and the rest of the world; they also have become essential engines driving the economies of their respective communities and regions. The education and research missions, however, require subsidization because tuition and extramural grant funding do not cover the costs of these endeavors. This subsidization largely has come from revenues generated by AMCs' clinical endeavors. The viability of this cross-subsidization, however, is increasingly threatened in the current clinical environment. The authors of this Perspective discuss these issues in depth and provide some concrete recommendations to address these challenges. They hope to stimulate discussion and, ultimately, ensure the financial viability of U.S. AMCs-a national resource of utmost importance. Recommendations to sustain research include creating strategic biomedical research plans, developing a defined and sustained model to support National Institutes of Health funding that keeps pace with inflation, and evolving funding mechanisms. Recommendations to sustain medical education include limiting student debt, creating more cost-effective curricula, and ensuring that clinical training opportunities that meet national standards are available to students.",Recommendations to Sustain the Academic Mission Ecosystem at U.S. Medical Schools.
"Objective To determine the impact of cannabis use disorder (CUD) on the inpatient outcomes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescents Background Previous studies have evaluated the impact of CUD on the health-related quality of life in ADHD patients. Methods We used the nationwide inpatient sample (NIS) from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) from years 2010--2014. We identified ADHD and cannabis use (CU) as the primary and the other diagnosis, respectively, using validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, and Clinical Modification (ICD-9--CM) codes. We used the binomial logistic regression model to generate adjusted odds ratios (aOR). Results We analyzed a total of 11,232 ADHD adolescent hospital admissions from years 2010-2014; of these, 1.79% had CUD. The mean age of adolescents was 14.1 years (SD = 1.79). The prevalence of CUD was highest in ADHD adolescents of 15-18 years (73%) and common in the white race (71%). A higher proportion of ADHD with CUD was transferred to acute care hospitals and skilled/other nursing facilities (5.4% and 7.4% vs. 1.1% and 2.6%, respectively, p-value < 0.001). CUD increases the risk of inpatient charges > $12,247 (median) by 0.6 times (aOR = 1.835; p-value = 0.002) and increases the risk of inpatient stay > 5 days (median) by 0.7 times (aOR = 2.099; p-value < 0.001). The utilization of psychotropic medications was reduced by 0.8 times in ADHD with CUD adolescents by 0.8 times (aOR = 0.448; p-value = 0.017), and the implication of behavioral therapy in the management of ADHD with CUD adolescents was reduced by 0.9 times (aOR = 0.412; p-value = 0.048). Also, there is a 2.8 times higher risk of comorbid alcohol abuse in ADHD with CUD adolescents (aOR = 17.141; p-value < 0.001). Conclusion The increased risk of substance use is a long-term implication of ADHD in adolescents. It has been determined that comorbid CUD in patients with ADHD not only increases the risk of acute inpatient care but also prolongs the inpatient stay, thus increasing the healthcare cost. Surprisingly, comorbid CUD decreases the utilization of psychotropic medications and behavioral therapy in ADHD. Another major issue is the higher risk of comorbid alcohol abuse in ADHD with CUD adolescents. Further exploration with randomized controlled studies would be required to support and highlight the growing issue of cannabis use among adolescents with ADHD.",Is Cannabis Use Associated With the Worst Inpatient Outcomes in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Adolescents?
"Physician psychological wellness is an emergent outcome resulting from dynamic interactions among complex conditions. We may enhance opportunities for physician wellness by applying principles developed to improve another emergent outcome: patient safety.

"Introduction: Communicable diseases are the leading causes of death in Tanzania despite the existence of effective treatment tools. We aimed to assess the sociocultural and health system factors associated with mortality from febrile illness in northern Tanzania. Methods: We interviewed febrile inpatients to determine prevalence of barriers in seeking or receiving care and grouped these barriers using the Three Delays model (delays at home, in transport and at healthcare facilities). We assessed 6-week mortality and, after matching on age, gender and severity of illness, measured the association between delays and mortality using conditional logistic regression. Results: We enrolled 475 children, of whom 18 (3.8%) died, and 260 adults, of whom 34 (13.0%) died. For children, home delays were not associated with mortality. Among adults, a delay in care-seeking due to not recognising severe symptoms was associated with mortality (OR: 3.01; 95% CI 1.24 to 7.32). For transport delays, taking >1 hour to reach a facility increased odds of death in children (OR: 3.27; 95% CI 1.11 to 9.66) and adults (OR: 3.03; 95% CI 1.32 to 6.99). For health system delays, each additional facility visited was associated with mortality for children (OR: 1.59; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.38) and adults (OR: 2.00; 95% CI 1.17 to 3.41), as was spending >4 days between the first facility visit and reaching tertiary care (OR: 4.39; 95% CI 1.49 to 12.93). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that delays at home, in transport and in accessing tertiary care are risk factors for mortality from febrile illness in northern Tanzania. Interventions that may reduce mortality include community education regarding severe symptoms, expanding transportation infrastructure and streamlining referrals to tertiary care for the sickest patients.",Sociocultural and health system factors associated with mortality among febrile inpatients in Tanzania: a prospective social biopsy cohort study.
"OBJECTIVE: Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen dependent condition that affects 5-10% of reproductive aged women and is associated with pelvic pain and infertility. As the approach to therapy shifts from surgical ablation to pharmacological control, a non-surgical mode of diagnosis would be desirable. The ENDOmarker study was designed by the NICHD Reproductive Medicine Network (RMN) to obtain well characterized and phenotyped bio specimens in a standardized fashion from women with and without endometriosis. DESIGN: Development of a diagnostic test. SETTING: Academic medical centers. PATIENTS: This study will enroll up to 500 participants, and follow them for up to 5months. Included subjects are aged 18-44, scheduled to undergo gynecologic surgery (laparoscopy/laparotomy) for clinical reasons. INTERVENTIONS: Presence and stage of endometriosis (or its absence) is characterized by visual examination at the time of surgery. Subjects will undergo extensive clinical evaluation pre-operatively and at visits one and four months postoperatively. Endometrial biopsy, blood, urine and disease specific questionnaires will be collected at each visit. MAIN OUTCOME: Samples will be placed in a bio-repository to be used to validate and optimize the clinical use of genomic classifiers of the endometrium alone or in combination with serum cytokines as a non-surgical composite marker of endometriosis. CONCLUSION: This protocol can serve as a reference for objective collection of high quality bio specimens for discovery or validation of potential nonsurgical diagnosis of presence or severity of disease.","Evaluation, validation and refinement of noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers for endometriosis (ENDOmarker): A protocol to phenotype bio-specimens for discovery and validation."
"Supranormal contractile properties are frequently associated with cardiac diseases. Anesthetic agents, including propofol, can depress myocardial contraction. We tested the hypothesis that fropofol, a propofol derivative, reduces force development in cardiac muscles via inhibition of cross-bridge cycling and may therefore have therapeutic potential. Force and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) transients of rat trabecular muscles were determined. Myofilament ATPase, actin-activated myosin ATPase, and velocity of actin filaments propelled by myosin were also measured. Fropofol dose dependently decreased force without altering [Ca(2+)]i in normal and pressure-induced hypertrophied-hypercontractile muscles. Similarly, fropofol depressed maximum Ca(2+)-activated force ( Fmax) and increased the [Ca(2+)]i required for 50% of Fmax (Ca50) at steady state without affecting the Hill coefficient in both intact and skinned cardiac fibers. The drug also depressed cardiac myofibrillar and actin-activated myosin ATPase activity. In vitro actin sliding velocity was significantly reduced when fropofol was introduced during rigor binding of cross-bridges. The data suggest that the depressing effects of fropofol on cardiac contractility are likely to be related to direct targeting of actomyosin interactions. From a clinical standpoint, these findings are particularly significant, given that fropofol is a nonanesthetic small molecule that decreases myocardial contractility specifically and thus may be useful in the treatment of hypercontractile cardiac disorders.-Ren, X., Schmidt, W., Huang, Y., Lu, H., Liu, W., Bu, W., Eckenhoff, R., Cammarato, A., Gao, W.

"Trauma-informed interventions have been implemented in various settings, but trauma-informed care (TIC) has not been widely incorporated into the treatment of adult patients with traumatic injuries. The purpose of this study was to examine health care provider knowledge, attitudes, practices, competence, and perceived barriers to implementation of TIC. This cross-sectional study used an anonymous web-based survey to assess attitudes, knowledge, perceived competence, and practice of TIC among trauma providers from an urban academic medical center with a regional resource trauma center. Providers (nurses, physicians, therapists [physical, occupational, respiratory]) working in trauma resuscitation, trauma critical care, and trauma care units were recruited. Descriptive statistics summarized knowledge, attitudes, practice, competence, and perceived barriers to TIC and logistic regression analyses examined factors predicting the use of TIC in practice. Of 147 participants, the majority were nurses (65%), followed by therapists (18%) and physicians (17%), with a median 3 years of experience; 75% answered the knowledge items correctly and 89% held favorable opinions about TIC. Nineteen percent rated themselves as less than ""somewhat competent."" All participants rated the following as significant barriers to providing basic TIC: time constraints, need of training, confusing information about TIC, and worry about retraumatizing patients. Self-rated competence was the most consistent predictor of providers' reported use of specific TIC practices. Despite some variability, providers were generally knowledgeable and held favorable views toward incorporating TIC into their practice. TIC training for trauma providers is needed and should aim to build providers' perceived competence in providing TIC.","Trauma Providers' Knowledge, Views, and Practice of Trauma-Informed Care."

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The role of PCNL and the expertise surrounding it has expanded in recent decades. Miniaturisation of equipment and instrument size has formed a part of this innovation. Although an increasing number of studies have been performed on miniaturised PCNL (Mi-PCNL) recently, a critical appraisal on these is lacking. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of Mi-PCNL techniques (< 15 Fr). RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic review was conducted from 1990 to March 2017 on outcomes of Mi-PCNL [micro PCNL (m-PCNL) and ultra-mini PCNL (UMP)] in adult patients. Ten studies (three on m-PCNL and seven on UMP) were included in our study. Across the three studies, 118 patients (mean age 42.2 years, male to female ratio 1.3:1) underwent m-PCNL (4.8 Fr). For a mean stone size of 13.9 mm, a mean stone-free rate (SFR) was 89% and an overall complication rate was 15.2% [Clavien classification I (44%), II (28%), III (28%)], with no Clavien IV or V complications. Across the seven studies, 262 patients (mean age 49.4 years, male to female ratio 1.5:1) underwent UMP (13-14 Fr). For a mean stone size of 18.6 mm, a mean SFR was 88.3% and an overall complication rate was 6.2% [Clavien classification I (57%), II (36%), III (7%)], with no Clavien IV or V complications. While the transfusion rates for m-PCNL was 0.85%, only one case each in m-PCNL and UMP needed conversion to mini PCNL. Our review shows that for small- to medium-sized renal stones, Mi-PCNL can yield good stone-free rates whilst maintaining a low morbidity associated with it. There were no Clavien > III complications and no mortality with only one transfusion reported from this minimally invasive technique.",Role of Minimally Invasive (Micro and Ultra-mini) PCNL for Adult Urinary Stone Disease in the Modern Era: Evidence from a Systematic Review.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We provide an overview of our current understanding of combination lipid-lowering therapies intended for dyslipidemia treatment and cardiovascular disease prevention. First, we analyze recent statin and non-statin combination therapy guidelines and clinical studies since the publication of 2013 American College of Cardiology Cholesterol Guidelines. Second, we examine the clinical utility of non-statin agents alone and in combination in terms of LDL-C lowering and ASCVD risk reduction. RECENT FINDINGS: Medical societies, including the American College of Cardiology (ACC), National Lipid Association (NLA), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), have released guidelines to address the appropriate use of non-statin therapies. The guidelines incorporated new evidence, including the IMPROVE-IT and FOURIER clinical trials, which demonstrate that the combination of statin therapy with other non-statin agents such as ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors has a significant clinical benefit. Increasing evidence that aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering leads to lower cardiovascular disease risk supports the need for continued exploration of the role of combination lipid-lowering therapies. A review of guidelines and clinical trials evaluating non-statin agents illuminates the growing base of evidence and expert opinion supporting the use of combination lipid-lowering therapies. While the majority of clinical trial data utilizes dyslipidemia monotherapy, especially statins, combination therapies represent an opportunity for individualized, patient-centered approach to LDL-C lowering and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction. The overview provides a perspective on lipid management intended for clinicians who seek additional information and guidance on the use of combination therapies.",A Clinical Guide to Combination Lipid-Lowering Therapy.
"Importance: Patients with somatic overgrowth commonly require surgical intervention to preserve function and improve cosmesis. To our knowledge no observation of scarring outcomes in this population has been published to date. Objective: To observe the frequency of abnormal scarring in patients with somatic overgrowth and sequencing-verified mutations in the PIK3CA gene. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective study evaluated scarring outcomes in patients with PIK3CA-related overgrowth. Samples of affected tissue were sequenced between July 2015 and October 2016. Medical records from multiple large academic tertiary care centers were reviewed for surgical history and scar descriptions, and clinical photographs were assessed by 2 surgeons (J.N.J. and D.M.K.) to confirm abnormal scarring. Analysis of medical records and photographs was performed between April 2017 and June 2017 by a multidisciplinary team from dermatology, plastic surgery, orthopedic surgery, radiology, and genetics departments. All patients considered for the study were diagnosed with somatic overgrowth and previously had affected tissue sent for next-generation sequencing. Those with pathogenic PIK3CA variants and 1 or more prior surgical procedures were reviewed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Presence of excessive scarring in patients with PIK3CA overgrowth. Results: A total of 57 patients with segmental overgrowth syndromes were sequenced. Of the 57 patients, 25 (44%) had pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. Of those with pathogenic PIK3CA variants, 6 (24%) had past surgical procedures, all with preoperative and postoperative photographs. Of 6 patients with PIK3CA-related overgrowth and a history of 1 or more surgical procedure, 4 (67%) developed excessive scarring. The cohort with abnormal scarring comprised 3 females and 1 male, with a median age of 8.5 years. All abnormal scarring occurred in affected overgrowth tissue. Three of the 4 patients developed the excessive scarring after debulking procedures for overgrowth and/or vascular malformations of the upper or lower extremity. Conclusions and Relevance: Excessive scarring occurred frequently in patients with PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndromes. The risk of abnormal scarring should therefore be discussed preoperatively. Given the activating nature of these PIK3CA variants, we suggest that the excessive scarring may be owing in part to up-regulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. Additional studies are needed to assess scarring outcomes in patients with other types of overgrowth.",Scarring in Patients With PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Syndromes.

"Unlike the overt nature of physical aggression, which lends itself to simpler and more direct methods of investigation, the often-masked nature of relational aggression has led to difficulties and debate regarding the most effective tools of study. Given concerns with the accuracy of third-party relational aggression reports, especially as individuals age, self-report measures may be particularly useful when assessing experiences with relational aggression. However, it is important to recognize validity concerns-in particular, the potential effects of item order presentation-associated with self-report of relational aggression perpetration and victimization. To investigate this issue, surveys were administered and completed by 179 young adults randomly assigned to one of four survey conditions reflecting manipulation of item order. Survey conditions included presentation of (a) perpetration items only, (b) victimization items only, (c) perpetration items followed by victimization items, and (d) victimization items followed by perpetration items. Results revealed that participants reported perpetrating relational aggression significantly more often when asked only about perpetration or when asked about perpetration before victimization, compared with participants who were asked about victimization before perpetration. Item order manipulation did not result in significant differences in self-reported victimization experiences. Results of this study indicate a need for greater consideration of item order when conducting research using self-report data and the importance of additional investigation into which form of item presentation elicits the most accurate self-report information.",A Methodological Study of Order Effects in Reporting Relational Aggression Experiences.
"An increasing number of countries are developing front-of-package (FOP) labels; however, there is limited evidence examining the impact of specific design characteristics for these labels. The current study investigated consumer perceptions of several FOP label design characteristics, including potential differences among sociodemographic sub-groups. Two hundred and thirty-four participants aged 16 years or older completed nine label rating tasks on a laptop at a local shopping mall in Canada. The rating tasks asked participants to rate five primary design characteristics (border, background presence, background colour, 'caution' symbol and government attribution) on their noticeability, readability, believability and likelihood of changing their beverage choice. FOP labels with a border, solid background and contrasting colours increased noticeability. A solid background increased readability, while a contrasting background colour reduced it. Both a 'caution' symbol and a government attribution increased the believability of the labels and the perceived likelihood of influencing beverage choice. The effect of the design characteristics was generally similar across sociodemographic groups, with modest differences in five of the nine outcomes. Label design characteristics, such as the use of a border, colour and symbols can enhance the salience of FOP nutrition labels and may increase the likelihood that FOP labels are used by consumers.",Consumer perceptions of specific design characteristics for front-of-package nutrition labels.
"War zone deployment and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been associated with morbidity and mortality decades later. Less is known about the associations between these variables and the early emergence of medical disorders in war zone veterans. This prospective study of 862 U.S. Army soldiers (n = 569 deployed; n = 293 nondeployed) examined: (a) associations between Iraq War deployment status (deployed vs. nondeployed) and new medical diagnoses that emerged within six months after return from Iraq among all participants; and (b) associations between combat severity and PTSD symptoms, and new postdeployment medical diagnoses that emerged within 12 months after return from Iraq within deployed participants. New medical diagnoses were abstracted from diagnostic codes associated with clinical outpatient visits recorded within the Department of Defense Standard Ambulatory Data Record database. Combat severity was measured with the Combat Experiences module of the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory, and postdeployment posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity was measured using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian. Neither deployment nor combat severity was associated with new medical diagnoses. However, among deployed soldiers, more severe PTSD symptoms were associated with increased risk for a new medical disorder diagnosis; every 10-point increase in PTSD symptoms increased odds of a new diagnosis by nearly 20% (odds ratio = 1.20). Results suggest that PTSD symptoms are associated with early morbidity in Iraq War veterans.","Prospective Examination of Early Associations of Iraq War Zone Deployment, Combat Severity, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with New Incident Medical Diagnoses."
"BACKGROUND: How patients experience the symptoms/signs of psoriasis is highly relevant for assessing treatment response. OBJECTIVES: Compare outcomes with guselkumab, placebo and adalimumab utilizing the novel, validated Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD). METHODS: VOYAGE 1 is an ongoing, phase III, double-blinded, controlled trial of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Patients were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg every 8 weeks; placebo-to-guselkumab 100 mg every 8 weeks; or adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks. The PSSD was self-administered to assess symptoms (i.e. itch, skin tightness, burning, stinging and pain) and signs (i.e. dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding/flaking, redness and bleeding) of psoriasis (0-10 [absent-to-worst-imaginable]) every 24 h. Symptom and sign summary scores were derived (0-100) based on average scores of the individual symptoms and signs. Proportions of patients with clinically meaningful improvements and symptom- and sign-free scores of 0 were evaluated across treatment groups at weeks 16, 24 and 48. RESULTS: At baseline, 652 of 837 randomized patients had PSSD scores. The proportion of patients achieving clinically meaningful improvements in PSSD summary scores was significantly higher in the guselkumab group compared with the placebo group at week 16 (P < 0.001) and compared with the adalimumab group at weeks 24 (P = 0.002) and 48 (P < 0.001). The proportions of patients achieving PSSD symptom and sign summary scores of 0 (i.e. symptom- and sign-free) were significantly higher for guselkumab vs. placebo at week 16 and vs. adalimumab at weeks 24 and 48 (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Based on PSSD scores, greater improvements in symptoms and signs of psoriasis were reported by patients treated with guselkumab compared with placebo at week 16 or adalimumab through 48 weeks.",Patient-reported symptoms and signs of moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with guselkumab or adalimumab: results from the randomized VOYAGE 1 trial.
"Molecular anomalies in MED13L, leading to haploinsufficiency, have been reported in patients with moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) and distinct facial features, with or without congenital heart defects. Phenotype of the patients was referred to ""MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome."" Missense variants in MED13L were already previously described to cause the MED13L-related syndrome, but only in a limited number of patients. Here we report 36 patients with MED13L molecular anomaly, recruited through an international collaboration between centers of expertise for developmental anomalies. All patients presented with intellectual disability and severe language impairment. Hypotonia, ataxia, and recognizable facial gestalt were frequent findings, but not congenital heart defects. We identified seven de novo missense variations, in addition to protein-truncating variants and intragenic deletions. Missense variants clustered in two mutation hot-spots, i.e., exons 15-17 and 25-31. We found that patients carrying missense mutations had more frequently epilepsy and showed a more severe phenotype. This study ascertains missense variations in MED13L as a cause for MED13L-related intellectual disability and improves the clinical delineation of the condition.",MED13L-related intellectual disability: involvement of missense variants and delineation of the phenotype.
"Importance: Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population. This is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor a clinically significant cancer ( approximately 10%), cause compressive symptoms ( approximately 5%), or progress to functional disease ( approximately 5%). Observations: Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology ( approximately 20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance: Most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and molecular testing, facilitates a personalized, risk-based protocol that promotes high-quality care and minimizes cost and unnecessary testing.",The Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Nodules: A Review.
"BACKGROUND: The field of pediatric orthopaedic surgery is evolving with a reported increase in the number of pediatric orthopaedic fellows being trained as well as an increase in the number of fellows completing additional fellowship training in another subspecialty. The purpose of this study was to examine the historic trends of trainees seeking multiple fellowships within pediatric orthopaedics over an 11-year period using the database of the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS). METHODS: We queried the ABOS database for fellowship choice of applicants for the ABOS part II oral examination with the self-declared subspecialty of pediatric orthopaedics during the years of 2005 to 2015. Descriptive analysis was performed to determine the percentage of applicants who completed >1 fellowship, and the type of subspecialty fellowship completed. chi analysis was used to compare the proportion of multiple fellowship trainees between years. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2015, 310 applicants for ABOS part II pediatric subspecialty examination had completed a fellowship in pediatric orthopaedic surgery, with that number increasing from 14 to 43/y over that span. Forty-five trainees (15%) completed 48 additional fellowships over that decade, with 2 recent trainees completing multiple additional fellowships. The most common additional fellowships were sports (n=22, 46%), hand (n=8, 17%), and spine (n=7, 15%). The rate of additional fellowship training increased over 5-fold from 5% in the first 3 years of the study to 28% in the last 2 years of the study (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of trainees completing additional subspecialty fellowships in addition to pediatric orthopaedics has risen over the past decade. The precise cause and effect of such change is uncertain and likely multifactorial. Reexamination of our classic training paradigms may be warranted in light of these trends.

"RATIONALE: Albuterol, a bronchodilator medication, is the first-line therapy for asthma worldwide. There are significant racial/ethnic differences in albuterol drug response. OBJECTIVES: To identify genetic variants important for bronchodilator drug response (BDR) in racially diverse children. METHODS: We performed the first whole-genome sequencing pharmacogenetics study from 1,441 children with asthma from the tails of the BDR distribution to identify genetic association with BDR. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified population-specific and shared genetic variants associated with BDR, including genome-wide significant (P < 3.53 x 10(-7)) and suggestive (P < 7.06 x 10(-6)) loci near genes previously associated with lung capacity (DNAH5), immunity (NFKB1 and PLCB1), and beta-adrenergic signaling (ADAMTS3 and COX18). Functional analyses of the BDR-associated SNP in NFKB1 revealed potential regulatory function in bronchial smooth muscle cells. The SNP is also an expression quantitative trait locus for a neighboring gene, SLC39A8. The lack of other asthma study populations with BDR and whole-genome sequencing data on minority children makes it impossible to perform replication of our rare variant associations. Minority underrepresentation also poses significant challenges to identify age-matched and population-matched cohorts of sufficient sample size for replication of our common variant findings. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of minority data, despite a collaboration of eight universities and 13 individual laboratories, highlights the urgent need for a dedicated national effort to prioritize diversity in research. Our study expands the understanding of pharmacogenetic analyses in racially/ethnically diverse populations and advances the foundation for precision medicine in at-risk and understudied minority populations.",Whole-Genome Sequencing of Pharmacogenetic Drug Response in Racially Diverse Children with Asthma.
"BACKGROUND: Future orientation (FO), an essential construct in youth development, encompassing goals, expectations for life, and ability to plan for the future. This study uses a multidimensional measure of future orientation to assess the relationship between change in future orientation and change in substance use over time. METHODS: Data were from the Pathways to Desistence study. Justice involved youth (n = 1,354), ages 14 to 18 at time of recruitment, completed interviews every six months for three years. Multiple measures were chosen a priori as elements of future orientation. After evaluating the psychometrics of a new measure for future orientation, we ran mixed effects cross-lagged panel models to assess the relationship between changes in future orientation and substance use (tobacco, marijuana, hard drugs, and alcohol). RESULTS: There was a significant bidirectional relationship between future orientation and all substance use outcomes. Adjusted models accounted for different sites, sex, age, ethnicity, parental education, and proportion of time spent in a facility. In adjusted models, higher levels of future orientation resulted in smaller increases in substance use at future time points. CONCLUSIONS: Future orientation and substance use influence each other in this sample of adolescent offenders. Treating substance use disorders is also likely to increase future orientation, promoting positive youth development more generally. This study expands our understanding of the longitudinal relationship between changes in future orientation and changes in levels of substance use in a sample of justice involved youth with high levels of substance use, a group of considerable clinical and policy interest.",The Observed Longitudinal Relationship between Future Orientation and Substance Use Among a Cohort of Youth with Serious Criminal Offenses.
"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic disease of the myocardium and bares the risk of progression to heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Identifying patients at risk remains an unmet need. Recognizing the dependence of microscopic susceptibility on tissue microstructure and on cardiac macromorphology we hypothesized that myocardial T2(*) might be altered in HCM patients compared to healthy controls. To test this hypothesis, myocardial T2(*)-mapping was conducted at 7.0 Tesla to enhance T2(*)-contrast. 2D CINE T2(*)-mapping was performed in healthy controls and HCM patients. To ensure that T2(*) is not dominated by macroscopic magnetic field inhomogeneities, volume selective B0 shimming was applied. T2(*) changes in the interventricular septum across the cardiac cycle were analyzed together with left ventricular radius and ventricular septal wall thickness. The results show that myocardial T2(*) is elevated throughout the cardiac cycle in HCM patients compared to healthy controls. A mean septal T2(*) = 13.7 +/- 1.1 ms (end-systole: T2(*),systole = 15.0 +/- 2.1, end-diastole: T2(*),diastole = 13.4 +/- 1.3 ms, T2(*),systole/T2(*),diastole ratio = 1.12) was observed in healthy controls. For HCM patients a mean septal T2(*) = 17.4 +/- 1.4 ms (end-systole: T2(*),systole = 17.7 +/- 1.2 ms, end-diastole: T2(*),diastole = 16.2 +/- 2.5 ms, T2(*),systole/T2(*),diastole ratio = 1.09) was found. Our preliminary results provide encouragement that assessment of T2(*) and its changes across the cardiac cycle may benefit myocardial tissue characterization in HCM.",Myocardial Effective Transverse Relaxation Time T 2(*) is Elevated in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: A 7.0 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.
"OBJECTIVES: To examine technical aspects of pediatric tracheal intubation using video recording and to determine the association between tracheal intubation technique and procedural outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Emergency department resuscitation bay in single tertiary pediatric center. PATIENTS: Children undergoing emergent tracheal intubation under videorecorded conditions. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A published scoring tool for characterizing patient positioning, intubator kinematics, and adjunctive maneuvers during tracheal intubation was applied to videorecorded pediatric resuscitations when tracheal intubation was performed. Procedural outcomes were measured from video review. Seventy-one children underwent 109 tracheal intubation attempts with an overall first attempt success rate of 69% and a median laryngoscopy duration of 34 seconds (interquartile range, 24-47 s). A significant subset of tracheal intubation attempts were made with the patient's bed at a height below the level of intubator's umbilicus (61%), the patient in a supine position without head elevation (55%), the intubator bent at the waist to greater than 45 degrees (66%), less than 1 cm of mouth opening by the intubator's right hand prior to laryngoscopy (46%), and with the intubator's face less than 12 inches away from the patient's mouth (65%). Adjunctive maneuvers were used in a minority of attempts (cricoid pressure 48%, external laryngeal manipulation 11%, retraction of the right corner of the patient's mouth 26%). On multivariate analysis, including controlling for patient age category and intubator background, retraction of the right corner of the patient's mouth by an assistant showed an independent association with successful tracheal intubation. No other technical aspects were associated with tracheal intubation success. CONCLUSIONS: Intubators commonly exhibited suboptimal technique during tracheal intubation such as bending deeply at the waist, having their eyes close to the patient's mouth, failing to widely open the patient's mouth, and not elevating the occiput in older children. Retraction of the right corner of the patient's mouth by an assistant during laryngoscopy and intubation was associated with TI success.",Videographic Assessment of Pediatric Tracheal Intubation Technique During Emergency Airway Management.
"BACKGROUND: In the past, elderly women with breast cancer were not offered surgery because of beliefs that they would experience serious complications from comorbidities and increased chronological age. Today the decision to offer surgery is based on a woman's fitness rather than her age. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the experience of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), anxiety, and reported pain levels in women who represent four different age groups after breast cancer surgery. This study employed a prospective comparative design. A large women's hospital which houses a Comprehensive Breast Care Program. Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer and scheduled for surgical resection. METHODS: Postoperative pain was measured in the postanesthesia care unit using an 11-point verbal pain scale, PONV was measured categorically, and if present, severity of nausea was assessed. Anxiety was measured preoperatively by the short-form Profile of Mood States. FINDINGS: A total of 97 women aged 37-78 participated in this study. Overall, 35% of all women experienced PONV; only two women (18%) in the highest age range (70-79) experienced PONV, yet they reported significantly more pain than women in the other age groups. Understanding the difference in postoperative symptoms experienced by older woman after surgery for breast cancer will support the development of age-specific strategies.",The Relationship of Age and Postoperative Pain in Women after Surgery for Breast Cancer.
"A single chain Fv fragment (scFv) is a fusion of the variable regions of heavy (VH ) and light (VL ) chains of immunoglobulins. They are important elements of chimeric antigen receptors for cancer therapy. We sought to produce a panel of 16 extracellular protein domains of tumor markers for use in scFv yeast library screenings. A series of vectors comprising various combinations of expression elements was made, but expression was unpredictable and more than half of the protein domains could not be produced using any of the constructs. Here we describe a novel fusion expression system based on mouse TEM7 (tumor endothelial marker 7), which could facilitate protein expression. With this approach we could produce all but one of the tumor marker domains that could not otherwise be expressed. In addition, we demonstrated that the tumor associated antigen hFZD10 produced as a fusion protein with mTEM7 could be used to enrich scFv antibodies from a yeast display library. Collectively our study demonstrates the potential of specific fusion proteins based on mTEM7 in enabling mammalian cell production of tumor targeting protein domains for therapeutic development.",A fusion-protein approach enabling mammalian cell production of tumor targeting protein domains for therapeutic development.
"OBJECTIVE: Few studies have explored behavioral strategies for managing chronic pain in older adults. Pain Care Management (PCM) is a telephone-based behavioral intervention for chronic pain. The present study examined chronic pain characteristics among older adults and tested the delivery of PCM as an adjunct to depression and anxiety care management. METHODS: Participants were drawn from a state-sponsored program offering care management services to community members aged 65 and older who were prescribed a psychotropic medication by a primary care provider. Chronic pain information was collected for all participants in the state program (N = 250) and treatment outcome data were collected for a subset with significant chronic pain. Eighty participants with high chronic pain interference were offered PCM and compared to 80 participants with chronic pain who received monitoring only on depression, anxiety, and pain interference outcomes. RESULTS: Chronic pain was identified in 14% of older adults newly prescribed a psychotropic medication. Compared to monitoring only, PCM participants had higher odds of seeing a reduction of 2 or more points in pain interference at 6 months. Pain care management participants' anxiety scores significantly decreased over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults treated with psychotropic medications often also experience chronic pain that interferes with daily activities. A telephone-based care management intervention is acceptable and feasible with an older community-based population and can lead to improvements in anxiety symptoms and interference from chronic pain. Further research will help to refine interventions that may help improve symptoms and increase functioning with this population.",Telephone-based management of chronic pain in older adults in an integrated care program.
"The MHC is recognized for its importance in human health and disease. However, many disease-associated variants throughout the region remain of unknown significance, residing predominantly within non-coding regions of the MHC. The characterization of non-coding RNA transcripts throughout the MHC is thus central to understanding the genetic contribution of these variants. Therefore, we characterize novel miRNA transcripts throughout the MHC by performing deep RNA sequencing of two B lymphoblastoid cell lines with completely characterized MHC haplotypes. Our analysis identifies 89 novel miRNA transcripts, 48 of which undergo Dicer-dependent biogenesis and are loaded onto the Argonaute silencing complex. Several of the identified mature miRNA and pre-miRNA transcripts are unique to specific MHC haplotypes and overlap common SNPs. Furthermore, 43 of the 89 identified novel miRNA transcripts lie within linkage disequilibrium blocks that contain a disease-associated SNP. These disease associated SNPs are associated with 65 unique disease phenotypes, suggesting that these transcripts may play a role in the etiology of numerous diseases associated with the MHC. Additional in silico analysis reveals the potential for thousands of putative pre-miRNA encoding loci within the MHC that may be expressed by different cell types and at different developmental stages.",Novel and Haplotype Specific MicroRNAs Encoded by the Major Histocompatibility Complex.

"The contribution of specific HLA Class II alleles in type 1 diabetes is determined by polymorphic amino acid epitopes that direct antigen binding therefore, along with conventional allele frequency analysis, epitope analysis can provide important insights into disease susceptibility. We analyzed the highly heterogeneous Cypriot population for the HLA class II loci of T1DM patients and controls and we report for the first time their allele frequencies. Within our patient cohort we identified a subgroup that did not carry the DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01 and DRB1*04:xx-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02 risk haplotypes but a novel recombinant one, DRB1*04:XX-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*02:01 designated DR4-DQ2.3. Through epitope analysis we identified established susceptibility (DQB1 A57, DRB1 H13) and resistance (DQB1 D57) residues as well as other novel susceptibility residues DRB1 Q70, DQB1 L26 and resistance residues DRB1 D70, R70 and DQB1 Y47. Prevalence of susceptibility epitopes was higher in patients and was not exclusively a result of linkage disequilibrium. Residues DRB1 Q70, DQB1 L26 and A57 and a 10 amino acid epitope of DQA1 were the most significant in discriminating risk alleles. An extended haplotype containing these epitopes was carried by 92% of our patient cohort. Sharing of susceptibility epitopes could also explain the absence of risk haplotypes in patients. Finally, many significantly associated epitopes were non-pocket residues suggesting that critical immune functions may exist spanning further from the binding pockets.",Combined effect of glutamine at position 70 of HLA-DRB1 and alanine at position 57 of HLA-DQB1 in type 1 diabetes: An epitope analysis.
"Some DNA or RNA sequences rich in guanine (G) nucleotides can adopt non-canonical conformations known as G-quadruplexes (G4). In the nuclear genome, G4 motifs have been associated with genome instability and gene expression defects, but they are increasingly recognized to be regulatory structures. Recent studies have revealed that G4 structures can form in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and G4 forming potential sequences are associated with the origin of mtDNA deletions. However, little is known about the regulatory role of G4 structures in mitochondria. In this short review, we will explore the potential for G4 structures to regulate mitochondrial function, based on evidence from the nucleus.",Potential roles for G-quadruplexes in mitochondria.
"New devices that use targeted electrical stimulation to treat refractory localization-related epilepsy have shown great promise, although it is not well known which targets most effectively prevent the initiation and spread of seizures. To better understand how the brain transitions from healthy to seizing on a local scale, we induced focal epileptiform activity in the visual cortex of five anesthetized cats with local application of the GABAA blocker picrotoxin while simultaneously recording local field potentials on a high-resolution electrocorticography array and laminar depth probes. Epileptiform activity appeared in the form of isolated events, revealing a consistent temporal pattern of ictogenesis across animals with interictal events consistently preceding the appearance of seizures. Based on the number of spikes per event, there was a natural separation between seizures and shorter interictal events. Two distinct spatial regions were seen: an epileptic focus that grew in size as activity progressed, and an inhibitory surround that exhibited a distinct relationship with the focus both on the surface and in the depth of the cortex. Epileptiform activity in the cortical laminae was seen concomitant with activity on the surface. Focus spikes appeared earlier on electrodes deeper in the cortex, suggesting that deep cortical layers may be integral to recruiting healthy tissue into the epileptic network and could be a promising target for interventional devices. Our study may inform more effective therapies to prevent seizure generation and spread in localization-related epilepsies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We induced local epileptiform activity and recorded continuous, high-resolution local field potentials from the surface and depth of the visual cortex in anesthetized cats. Our results reveal a consistent pattern of ictogenesis, characterize the spatial spread of the epileptic focus and its relationship with the inhibitory surround, and show that focus activity within events appears earliest in deeper cortical layers. These findings have potential implications for the monitoring and treatment of refractory epilepsy.",Spatiotemporal evolution of focal epileptiform activity from surface and laminar field recordings in cat neocortex.
"Introduction: Suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology (SNAP) is a biomarker driven designation that represents a heterogeneous group in terms of etiology and prognosis. SNAP has only been identified by cross-sectional neurodegeneration measures, whereas longitudinal measures might better reflect ""active"" neurodegeneration and might be more tightly linked to prognosis. We compare neurodegeneration defined by cross-sectional 'hippocampal volume' only (SNAP/L-) versus both cross-sectional and longitudinal 'hippocampal atrophy rate' (SNAP/L+) and investigate how these definitions impact prevalence and the clinical and biomarker profile of SNAP in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Methods: 276 MCI patients from ADNI-GO/2 were designated amyloid ""positive"" (A+) or ""negative"" (A-) based on their florbetapir scan and neurodegeneration 'positive' or 'negative' based on cross-sectional hippocampal volume and longitudinal hippocampal atrophy rate. Results: 74.1% of all SNAP participants defined by the cross-sectional definition of neurodegeneration also met the longitudinal definition of neurodegeneration, whereas 25.9% did not. SNAP/L+ displayed larger white matter hyperintensity volume, a higher conversion rate to dementia over 5years and a steeper decline on cognitive tasks compared to SNAP/L- and the A- CN group. SNAP/L- had more abnormal values on neuroimaging markers and worse performance on cognitive tasks than the A- CN group, but did not show a difference in dementia conversion rate or longitudinal cognition. Discussion: Using a longitudinal definition of neurodegeneration in addition to a cross-sectional one identifies SNAP participants with significant cognitive decline and a worse clinical prognosis for which cerebrovascular disease may be an important driver.",Defining SNAP by cross-sectional and longitudinal definitions of neurodegeneration.
"The logical consequence of implementing competency-based education is moving to time-variable training. Competency-based, time-variable training (CBTVT) requires an understanding of how learners interact with their learning context and how that leads to competence. In this article, the authors discuss this relationship. They first explain that the time required to achieve competence in clinical practice depends on the availability of clinical experiences that are conducive to ongoing competence development. This requires both curricular flexibility in light of the differences in individual learners' development and a balance between longitudinal placements and transitions to different environments.Along with the deliberate use of the opportunities that learning environments offer, there is value for learners in spending ample time-in-context. For instance, guided independence is possible when trainees do not progress immediately after meeting curricular learning objectives. Next, the potential implications of CBTVT can be illustrated by two learning perspectives-Sfard's acquisition and participation metaphors-which leads to the assertion that competence is both an individual characteristic and a quality that emerges from a purposeful social interaction between individuals and their context. This theory recognizes that the deliberate use of context could be used to approach learning as acquiring collective competence.Based on this relationship between learner, context, and competence, the authors propose an approach to CBTVT that recognizes that all learners will have to meet a number of standard preset learning targets in their workplace, while still having room for further context-specific competence development and personal growth within strategically organized learning environments.",Learning in Practice: A Valuation of Context in Time-Variable Medical Training.
"Competency-based, time-variable medical education has reshaped the perceptions and practices of teachers, curriculum designers, faculty developers, clinician educators, and program administrators. This increasingly popular approach highlights the fact that learning among different individuals varies in duration, foundation, and goal. Time variability places particular demands on the assessment data that are so necessary for making decisions about learner progress. These decisions may be formative (e.g., feedback for improvement) or summative (e.g., decisions about advancing a student). This article identifies challenges to collecting assessment data and to making assessment decisions in a time-variable system. These challenges include managing assessment data, defining and making valid assessment decisions, innovating in assessment, and modeling the considerable complexity of assessment in real-world settings and richly interconnected social systems. There are hopeful signs of creativity in assessment both from researchers and practitioners, but the transition from a traditional to a competency-based medical education system will likely continue to create much controversy and offer opportunities for originality and innovation in assessment.","Enhanced Requirements for Assessment in a Competency-Based, Time-Variable Medical Education System."
"The introduction of competency-based medical education has shifted thinking from a fixed-time model to one stressing attained competencies, independent of the time needed to arrive at those competencies. In this article, the authors explore theoretical and conceptual issues related to time variability in medical training, starting with the Carroll model from the 1960s that put time in the equation of learning. They discuss mastery learning, deliberate practice, and learning curves.While such behaviorist theories apply well to structured courses and highly structured training settings, learning in the clinical workplace is not well captured in such theories or in the model that Carroll proposed. Important in clinical training are self-regulation and motivation; neurocognitive perspectives of time and learning; professional identity formation; and entrustment as an objective of training-all of which may be viewed from the perspective of the time needed to complete training. The authors conclude that, in approaching time variability, the Carroll equation is too simplistic in its application to the breadth of medical training. The equation may be expanded to include variables that determine effective workplace learning, but future work will need to examine the validity of these additional factors.",Time-Variable Training in Medicine: Theoretical Considerations.
"Aging is a complex process associated with a decline in functionality of adult stem cells affecting tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Calorie restriction (CR) is the only experimental manipulation known to extend lifespan and reduce the incidence of age-related disorders across numerous species. These benefits are likely mediated, at least in part, through the preservation of stem cell function. Here, we show that CR enhances the regenerative capacity of the intestinal epithelium through preservation of an injury-resistant reserve intestinal stem cell (ISC) pool. Cell-autonomous activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) governs the sensitivity of reserve ISCs to injury. CR inhibits mTORC1 in these cells, protecting them against DNA damage, while mTORC1 stimulation, either genetically or through nutrient sensing, sensitizes reserve ISCs to injury, thus compromising regeneration of the epithelium. These data delineate a critical role for mTORC1 in epithelial regeneration and inform clinical strategies based on nutrient modulation.",Calorie Restriction Governs Intestinal Epithelial Regeneration through Cell-Autonomous Regulation of mTORC1 in Reserve Stem Cells.
"We have an operant rat model of upper extremity reaching and grasping in which we examined the impact of performing a high force high repetition (High-ForceHR) versus a low force low repetition (Low-ForceHR) task for 18weeks on the radius and ulna, compared to age-matched controls. High-ForceHR rats performed at 4 reaches/min and 50% of their maximum voluntary pulling force for 2h/day, 3days/week. Low-ForceHR rats performed at 6% maximum voluntary pulling force. High-ForceHR rats showed decreased trabecular bone volume in the distal metaphyseal radius, decreased anabolic indices in this same bone region (e.g., decreased osteoblasts and bone formation rate), and increased catabolic indices (e.g., microcracks, increased osteocyte apoptosis, secreted sclerostin, RANKL, and osteoclast numbers), compared to controls. Distal metaphyseal trabeculae in the ulna of High-ForceHR rats showed a non-significant decrease in bone volume, some catabolic indices (e.g., decreased trabecular numbers) yet also some anabolic indices (e.g., increased osteoblasts and trabecular thickness). In contrast, the mid-diaphyseal region of High-ForceHR rats' radial and ulnar bones showed few to no microarchitecture differences and no changes in apoptosis, sclerostin or RANKL levels, compared to controls. In further contrast, Low-ForceHR rats showed increased trabecular bone volume in the radius in the distal metaphysis and increased cortical bone area its mid-diaphysis. These changes were accompanied by increased anabolic indices, no microcracks or osteocyte apoptosis, and decreased RANKL in each region, compared to controls. Ulnar bones of Low-ForceHR rats also showed increased anabolic indices, although fewer than in the adjacent radius. Thus, prolonged performance of an upper extremity reaching and grasping task is loading-, region-, and bone-dependent, with high force loads at high repetition rates inducing region-specific increases in bone degradative changes that were most prominent in distal radial trabeculae, while low force task loads at high repetition rates induced adaptive bone responses.","Prolonged high force high repetition pulling induces osteocyte apoptosis and trabecular bone loss in distal radius, while low force high repetition pulling induces bone anabolism."
"To investigate the prevalence of cognitive impairment and its risk factors among Chinese elders aged over 80 years, a community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from May to June 2016 in Shanghai, China. Cognitive function was measured by using Mini-Mental Status Examination. Multiple logistic regression assessed associations between risk factors and cognitive impairment. Of 480 participants, 30% were diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Women [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-2.83], solitary life (AOR: 3.15, 1.89-5.26), monthly income less than 2000 Chinese yuan (AOR: 3.47, 1.18-10.23) were significantly associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment, compared with men, non-solitary life, and monthly income greater than 4000 Chinese yuan, respectively. Overweight (AOR: 0.59, 0.36-0.97), being physically active at least 60 minutes per day (AOR: 0.59, 0.35-0.95), antihypertensive drugs users (AOR: 0.45, 0.28-0.72), and lipid lowering drugs users (AOR: 0.21, 0.06-0.76) significantly lowered the risk of cognitive impairment, compared with normal weight, inadequate outdoor activity, and non-medication users, respectively. Accordingly, this study found that women, solitary life, lower income was associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment, while overweight, being physically active, and antihypertensive and lipid lowering drugs usage might lower the risk.","Investigation of the prevalence of Cognitive Impairment and its risk factors within the elderly population in Shanghai, China."
"Syntaxins are a conserved family of SNARE proteins and contain C-terminal transmembrane anchors required for their membrane fusion activity. Here we show that Stx3 (syntaxin 3) unexpectedly also functions as a nuclear regulator of gene expression. We found that alternative splicing creates a soluble isoform that we termed Stx3S, lacking the transmembrane anchor. Soluble Stx3S binds to the nuclear import factor RanBP5 (RAN-binding protein 5), targets to the nucleus, and interacts physically and functionally with several transcription factors, including ETV4 (ETS variant 4) and ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2). Stx3S is differentially expressed in normal human tissues, during epithelial cell polarization, and in breast cancer versus normal breast tissue. Inhibition of endogenous Stx3S expression alters the expression of cancer-associated genes and promotes cell proliferation. Similar nuclear-targeted, soluble forms of other syntaxins were identified, suggesting that nuclear signaling is a conserved, novel function common among these membrane-trafficking proteins.",Soluble syntaxin 3 functions as a transcriptional regulator.
"Objective: Development of early social skills in children is a complex process. To understand this process, it is important to assess how strengths or weaknesses in other developmental domains may be affected by these skills. The present study aimed at investigating the association of motor skills and imitation ability with early social communication skills in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Method: In this study, 20 children with ASD aged 3 to 5 years (M = 4.05, SD = 0.55) participated. All children were diagnosed as ASD based on the DSM-V criteria by an independent child psychiatrist. Additionally, Autism Diagnostic interview-Revised was used for subsequent diagnostic confirmation. Children were tested with Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD-2), the Motor Imitation Scale (MIS), and the Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS). All examinations were videotaped for subsequent scoring. The relationship between these skills was estimated by Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: A significant and strong correlation was obtained between TGMD total score and imitation total score (r =.776; p <0.001). However, the relationship between MIS subscales and TGMD-2 locomotor subtest scores was not significant (P>0.05). A significant correlation was found between MIS and TGMD total scores with Initiating Joint Attention and Responding to Joint Attention (p</=0/025) as ESCS subscales. But MIS and TGMD total scores were not correlated with social interaction and responding to behavioral requests subscales. Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that indicated both imitation ability and motor function have an association with each other and with early social communication skills.","The Relationship between Motor, Imitation, and Early Social Communication Skills in Children with Autism."
"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Long-term survival after lung transplantation (LTx) is limited by bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), defined as a sustained decline in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) not explained by other causes. We assessed whether machine learning (ML) utilizing quantitative computed tomography (qCT) metrics can predict eventual development of BOS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paired inspiratory-expiratory CT scans of 71 patients who underwent LTx were analyzed retrospectively (BOS [n = 41] versus non-BOS [n = 30]), using at least two different time points. The BOS cohort experienced a reduction in FEV1 of >10% compared to baseline FEV1 post LTx. Multifactor analysis correlated declining FEV1 with qCT features linked to acute inflammation or BOS onset. Student t test and ML were applied on baseline qCT features to identify lung transplant patients at baseline that eventually developed BOS. RESULTS: The FEV1 decline in the BOS cohort correlated with an increase in the lung volume (P = .027) and in the central airway volume at functional residual capacity (P = .018), not observed in non-BOS patients, whereas the non-BOS cohort experienced a decrease in the central airway volume at total lung capacity with declining FEV1 (P = .039). Twenty-three baseline qCT parameters could significantly distinguish between non-BOS patients and eventual BOS developers (P < .05), whereas no pulmonary function testing parameters could. Using ML methods (support vector machine), we could identify BOS developers at baseline with an accuracy of 85%, using only three qCT parameters. CONCLUSIONS: ML utilizing qCT could discern distinct mechanisms driving FEV1 decline in BOS and non-BOS LTx patients and predict eventual onset of BOS. This approach may become useful to optimize management of LTx patients.",Machine Learning Algorithms Utilizing Quantitative CT Features May Predict Eventual Onset of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome After Lung Transplantation.
"BACKGROUND: Preliminary semi-quantitative cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) perfusion studies have demonstrated reduced myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) in patients with angina and risk factors for microvascular disease (MVD), however fully quantitative CMR has not been studied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether fully quantitative CMR identifies reduced MPR in this population, and to investigate the relationship between epicardial atherosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), extracellular volume (ECV), and perfusion. METHODS: Forty-six patients with typical angina and risk factors for MVD (females, or males with diabetes or metabolic syndrome) who had no obstructive coronary artery disease by coronary angiography and 20 healthy control subjects underwent regadenoson stress CMR perfusion imaging using a dual-sequence quantitative spiral pulse sequence to quantify MPR. Subjects also underwent T1 mapping to quantify ECV, and computed tomographic (CT) coronary calcium scoring to assess atherosclerosis burden. RESULTS: In patients with risk factors for MVD, both MPR (2.21 [1.95,2.69] vs. 2.93 [2.763.19], p < 0.001) and stress myocardial perfusion (2.65 +/- 0.62 ml/min/g, vs. 3.17 +/- 0.49 ml/min/g p < 0.002) were reduced as compared to controls. These differences remained after adjusting for age, left ventricular (LV) mass, body mass index (BMI), and gender. There were no differences in native T1 or ECV between subjects and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Stress myocardial perfusion and MPR as measured by fully quantitative CMR perfusion imaging are reduced in subjects with risk factors for MVD with no obstructive CAD as compared to healthy controls. Neither myocardial hypertrophy nor fibrosis accounts for these differences.",Quantitative cardiovascular magnetic resonance perfusion imaging identifies reduced flow reserve in microvascular coronary artery disease.

"Children born with anatomic or functional ""single ventricle"" must progress through two or more major operations to sustain life. This management sequence culminates in the total cavopulmonary connection, or ""Fontan"" operation. A consequence of the ""Fontan circulation"", however, is elevated central venous pressure and inadequate ventricular preload, which contribute to continued morbidity. We propose a solution to these problems by increasing pulmonary blood flow using an ""injection jet"" (IJS) in which the source of blood flow and energy is the ventricle itself. The IJS has the unique property of lowering venous pressure while enhancing pulmonary blood flow and ventricular preload. We report preliminary results of an analysis of this circulation using a tightly-coupled, multi-scale computational fluid dynamics model. Our calculations show that, constraining the excess volume load to the ventricle at 50% (pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of 1.5), an optimally configured IJS can lower venous pressure by 3 mmHg while increasing systemic oxygen delivery. Even this small decrease in venous pressure may have substantial clinical impact on the Fontan patient. These findings support the potential for a straightforward surgical modification to decrease venous pressure, and perhaps improve clinical outcome in selected patients.",Computational Investigation of a Self-Powered Fontan Circulation.

"BACKGROUND: Transplantation-acquired food allergies (TAFA) are frequently reported and considered to be caused by immunosuppressive therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the allergic and immunologic responses in children who had liver or kidney transplantations. METHODS: Twelve children receiving liver transplantations and 10 children receiving kidney transplantations were investigated. All children underwent the allergy work-up and in most of them, lymphocyte screening and serum cytokine measurements were also performed. RESULTS: TAFA were found in 7/12 (58%) children with liver transplantations and in none of the 10 children with kidney transplantations. The mean age at transplantation was significantly lower in children who underwent liver transplantations (p<0.001). The immunosuppressive therapy administered to children with liver transplantation was tacrolimus in 11 patients and cyclosporine in one patient, while all 10 children with kidney transplantation received tacrolimus plus mycophenolate. The most common antigenic food was egg. The natural killer (NK) cell numbers were significantly higher in liver-transplant children than in kidney-transplant children. No significant differences were found in the serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that liver-transplant children treated with tacrolimus alone have a higher risk of developing TAFA than kidney-transplant children treated with tacrolimus plus mycophenolate. NK cells might be involved in this difference.",Increase of natural killer cells in children with liver transplantation-acquired food allergy.

"beta-cell replacement therapy, available currently as pancreas or islet transplantation, has developed without a clear definition of graft functional and clinical outcomes. The International Pancreas & Islet Transplant Association (IPITA) and European Pancreas & Islet Transplantation Association (EPITA) held a workshop to develop consensus for an IPITA/EPITA Statement on the definition of function and failure of current and future forms of beta-cell replacement therapy. There was consensus that beta-cell replacement therapy could be considered as a treatment for beta-cell failure, regardless of etiology and without requiring undetectable C-peptide, accompanied by glycemic instability with either problematic hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Glycemic control should be assessed at a minimum by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c ) and the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia. Optimal beta-cell graft function is defined by near-normal glycemic control [HbA1c </= 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)] without severe hypoglycemia or requirement for insulin or other antihyperglycemic therapy, and with an increase over pretransplant measurement of C-peptide. Good beta-cell graft function requires HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) without severe hypoglycemia and with a significant (>50%) reduction in insulin requirements and restoration of clinically significant C-peptide production. Marginal beta-cell graft function is defined by failure to achieve HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), the occurrence of any severe hypoglycemia, or less than 50% reduction in insulin requirements when there is restoration of clinically significant C-peptide production documented by improvement in hypoglycemia awareness/severity, or glycemic variability/lability. A failed beta-cell graft is defined by the absence of any evidence for clinically significant C-peptide production. Optimal and good functional outcomes are considered successful clinical outcomes.",Defining outcomes for beta-cell replacement therapy in the treatment of diabetes: a consensus report on the Igls criteria from the IPITA/EPITA opinion leaders workshop.
"Children in homes with intimate partner violence (IPV) are at increased risk for physical abuse. We determined the frequency and injury patterns in children who underwent child abuse consultation after IPV exposure by retrospectively analyzing the ""Examination of Siblings To Recognize Abuse"" cohort of children referred for physical abuse. Children were selected who presented after IPV exposure. Among 2890 children evaluated by child abuse pediatricians, 61 (2.1%) patients presented after IPV exposure. Of the 61, 11 (18.0%) were exposed to IPV, but had no direct involvement in the IPV event, 36 (59.0%) sustained inadvertent trauma during IPV, and 14 (23.0%) were directly assaulted during IPV. Thirty-six patients (59.0%) had an injury: 31 (51.0%) had cutaneous injuries and 15 (24.6%) had internal injuries including fracture(s), intracranial or intra-abdominal injury. Of the 15 patients with internal injuries, 14 (93.3%) were less than 12 months old. Among the 36 patients with injuries, 16 (44.4%) had no report of direct injury, a report of a mechanism that did not explain the identified injuries, or a report of trauma without a specific mechanism. Five (13.9%) did not have physical examination findings to suggest the extent of their internal injuries. Injuries are present in a significant proportion of children presenting to Emergency Departments after IPV exposure. History and physical examination alone are insufficient to detect internal injuries especially in infants.

"Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in a RecQ-family DNA helicase (WRN). Mice lacking part of the helicase domain of the WRN ortholog exhibit several phenotypic features of WS. In this study, we generated a Wrn mutant line that, like humans, relies entirely on dietary sources of vitamin C (ascorbate) to survive, by crossing them to mice that lack the gulonolactone oxidase enzyme required for ascorbate synthesis. In the presence of 0.01% ascorbate (w/v) in drinking water, double-mutant mice exhibited a severe reduction in lifespan, small size, sterility, osteopenia, and metabolic profiles different from wild-type (WT) mice. Although increasing the dose of ascorbate to 0.4% improved dramatically the phenotypes of double-mutant mice, the metabolic and cytokine profiles were different from age-matched WT mice. Finally, double-mutant mice treated with 0.01% ascorbate revealed a permanent activation of all the 3 branches of the ER stress response pathways due to a severe chronic oxidative stress in the ER compartment. In addition, markers associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent ER-associated degradation pathway were increased. Augmenting the dose of ascorbate reversed the activation of this pathway to WT levels rendering this pathway a potential therapeutic target in WS.-Aumailley, L., Dubois, M. J., Brennan, T.

"Importance: The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients (age range, 15-39 years) in the United States is increasing at a greater rate than in younger or older persons. Their optimal treatment has been increasingly debated as pediatric regimens have become more widely used in the age group. This review compares the basic features of pediatric and adult chemotherapy regimens for ALL and LBL, recognizes and describes the challenges of the pediatric regimen, and suggests strategies to facilitate its adoption for AYAs with ALL and LBL. Observations: All but 2 of 25 published comparisons of outcomes with pediatric and adult regimens for ALL and LBL in AYAs and 1 meta-analysis favor the pediatric regimen. After more than a half-century of clinical trials of the pediatric regimens, including at least 160 phase 3 trials in the United States, the pediatric regimens have become far more complex than most adult regimens. Asparaginase, a critical component of the pediatric regimens, is more difficult to administer to AYAs (and older patients) but nonetheless has a favorable benefit to toxicity ratio for AYAs. A dramatic reduction in outcome of ALL and LBL during the AYA years (the ""survival cliff"") is coincident with similar reductions in proportions of AYAs referred to academic centers and enrolled on clinical trials (the ""accrual cliff"" and ""referral cliff""). Conclusions and Relevance: The accumulating data increasingly support treating AYAs with ALL and LBL with a pediatric-inspired regimen or an approved institutional or national clinical trial tailored for this patient group.

"Little is known about the career satisfaction of pediatric psychologists, who specialize in psychological research, teaching, and clinical service in the context of pediatric healthcare. As part of the larger Society of Pediatric Psychology Workforce Survey and in collaboration with the American Psychological Association Center for Workforce Studies, this study aimed to: (1) describe the career domains which pediatric psychologists perceive to be important and their satisfaction in each domain, and (2) compare satisfaction of pediatric psychologists across work settings, number of positions, appointment duration, professional roles, career stage, academic rank, and gender. Responses from 336 pediatric psychologists demonstrated high career satisfaction. Domains of career satisfaction that received mean scores indicating high importance include balance of work and personal lives, peer/collegial support, and flexibility and choice in the workplace, but on average respondents reported being only somewhat satisfied in these domains. Total satisfaction scores were significantly higher among pediatric psychologists in 9-10 month appointments, primarily research careers, and at higher academic ranks, but scores were similar across employment settings and genders. To enhance career satisfaction and retention, pediatric psychologists may seek additional mentorship or explore new employment roles, and administrators and managers may consider adopting workplace policies or making environmental changes that could address specific areas of need. Public Significance Statement: This study suggests that overall, pediatric psychologists are highly satisfied with their employment. However, there may be some important aspects of their work that could be more satisfying. The findings have implications for identifying professional development strategies that can maintain or enhance satisfaction.",Pediatric Psychologists' Career Satisfaction: 2015 Society of Pediatric Psychology Workforce Survey Results.
"T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare and poor-prognostic mature T-cell malignancy. Here we integrated large-scale profiling data of alterations in gene expression, allelic copy number (CN), and nucleotide sequences in 111 well-characterized patients. Besides prominent signatures of T-cell activation and prevalent clonal variants, we also identify novel hot-spots for CN variability, fusion molecules, alternative transcripts, and progression-associated dynamics. The overall lesional spectrum of T-PLL is mainly annotated to axes of DNA damage responses, T-cell receptor/cytokine signaling, and histone modulation. We formulate a multi-dimensional model of T-PLL pathogenesis centered around a unique combination of TCL1 overexpression with damaging ATM aberrations as initiating core lesions. The effects imposed by TCL1 cooperate with compromised ATM toward a leukemogenic phenotype of impaired DNA damage processing. Dysfunctional ATM appears inefficient in alleviating elevated redox burdens and telomere attrition and in evoking a p53-dependent apoptotic response to genotoxic insults. As non-genotoxic strategies, synergistic combinations of p53 reactivators and deacetylase inhibitors reinstate such cell death execution.",Actionable perturbations of damage responses by TCL1/ATM and epigenetic lesions form the basis of T-PLL.

"Introduction: Favourable pain relief results on evoking autonomous twitches at myofascial trigger points with Electrical Twitch Obtaining Intramuscular Stimulation (ETOIMS). Aim: To document autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) from blood pressure (BP) and pulse/heart rate changes with ETOIMS. Methods and materials: A patient with persistent pain regularly received serial ETOIMS sessions of 60, 90, 120 or >/=150 min over 24 months. Outcome measures include BP: systolic, diastolic, pulse pressure and pulse/heart rate, pre-session/immediate-post-session summed differences (SDPPP index), and pain reduction. His results were compared with that of two other patients and one normal control. Each individual represented the following maximal elicitable twitch forces (TWF) graded 1-5: maximum TWF2: control subject; maximum TWF3: CRPS patient with suspected ANS dysfunction; and maximum TWF4 and TWF5: two patients with respective slow-fatigue and fast-fatigue twitches who during ETOIMS had autonomous twitching at local and remote myotomes simultaneously from denervation supersensitivity. ETOIMS results between TWFs were compared using one-way analysis of variance test. Results: The patients showed immediate significant pain reduction, BP and pulse/heart rate changes/reduction(s) except for diastolic BP in the TWF5 patient. TWF2 control subject had diastolic BP reduction with ETOIMS but not with rest. Linear regression showed TWF grade to be the most significant variable in pain reduction, more so than the number of treatments, session duration and treatment interval. TWF grade was the most important variable in significantly reducing outcome measures, especially pulse/heart rate. Unlike others, the TWF3 patient had distinctive reductions in SDPPP index. Conclusions: Measuring BP and pulse/heart rate is clinically practical for alerting ANS dysfunction maintained CRPS. SDPPP index (>/=26) and pulse/heart rate (>/=8) reductions with almost every ETOIMS treatment, plus inability to evoke autonomous twitches due to pain-induced muscle hypertonicity, are pathognomonic of this problem.",Autonomic components of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) are favourably affected by Electrical Twitch-Obtaining Intramuscular Stimulation (ETOIMS): effects on blood pressure and heart rate.

We identify 5,966 mutations, from which we extract 142 informative markers then genotyped in about 8,000 subjects from 145 African, Eurasian and African American populations. We find that the coalescence age of the trans-Saharan haplogroups dates back to the last Green Sahara, while most northern African or sub-Saharan clades expanded locally in the subsequent arid phase. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the Green Sahara promoted human movements and demographic expansions, possibly linked to the adoption of pastoralism. Comparing our results with previously reported genome-wide data, we also find evidence for a sex-biased sub-Saharan contribution to northern Africans, suggesting that historical events such as the trans-Saharan slave trade mainly contributed to the mtDNA and autosomal gene pool, whereas the northern African paternal gene pool was mainly shaped by more ancient events.",The peopling of the last Green Sahara revealed by high-coverage resequencing of trans-Saharan patrilineages.
"Cognitive control (CC) - the ability to regulate attention and memory - plays an important role in a variety of health behaviors, including smoking behavior. In this theoretical review of the literature, we propose a CC and smoking behavior framework that includes 1) the positive influence of CC on the self-regulation of smoking; 2) nicotine-induced improvements in CC that may indirectly reinforce smoking (including withdrawal reversal effects); and 3) the long-term effects of smoking on the brain that may result in reduced CC. Integration of these literatures suggests that CC contributes to both self-regulation (i.e., brake pedal) and nicotine-related reinforcement (i.e., gas pedal) amid the catastrophic effects of long-term smoking, which may reduce self-regulatory control over smoking while also enhancing indirect reinforcement. Supportive evidence and limitations of this approach will be presented, as well as ideas for future research directions that may more fully examine this multifaceted modeling of CC in relation to smoking behavior.",The Role of Cognitive Control in the Self-Regulation and Reinforcement of Smoking Behavior.
"INTRODUCTION: For the past decade, the focus of complex disease research has been the genotype. From technological advancements to the development of analysis methods, great progress has been made. However, advances in our definition of the phenotype have remained stagnant. Phenotype characterization has recently emerged as an exciting area of informatics and machine learning. The copious amounts of diverse biomedical data that have been collected may be leveraged with data-driven approaches to elucidate trait-related features and patterns. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the phenotype in traditional genetic associations and the challenges this has imposed.Approaches for phenotype refinement that can aid in more accurate characterization of traits are also discussed. Further, the authors highlight promising machine learning approaches for establishing a phenotype and the challenges of electronic health record (EHR)-derived data. Expert commentary: The authors hypothesize that through unsupervised machine learning, data-driven approaches can be used to define phenotypes rather than relying on expert clinician knowledge. Through the use of machine learning and an unbiased set of features extracted from clinical repositories, researchers will have the potential to further understand complex traits and identify patient subgroups. This knowledge may lead to more preventative and precise clinical care.",Informatics and machine learning to define the phenotype.
"Background: Sports concussion has an annual incidence of approximately 3.8 million. Over half go unreported and a substantial number may be asymptomatic. A rapid, cost-effective, and reliable tool that facilitates diagnosis of concussion is needed. The King-Devick (K-D) test is a vision-based tool of rapid number naming for assessment of concussion. In this study, we evaluated the utility of the K-D test in real time for identification of symptomatic concussion in youth athletes and to determine if similar impairment (subclinical concussion) exists in youth athletes without an obvious head injury or symptoms. Methods: Youth hockey players underwent K-D testing preseason, postseason, and immediately after suspected concussion. Additional testing was performed in a subgroup of nonconcussed athletes immediately before and after a game to determine effects of fatigue on K-D scores. Results: Among 141 players tested, 20 had clinically diagnosed concussion. All 20 had immediate postconcussion K-D times >5 seconds from baseline (average 7.3 seconds) and all but 2 had worse postseason scores (46.4 seconds vs 52.4 seconds, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Nonconcussed athletes saw minimal improvement postseason (43.9 seconds vs 42.1 seconds, p < 0.05) and 51 nonconcussed players assessed before and after a game revealed no significant time change as a result of fatigue. Conclusions: Rapid number naming using the K-D test accurately identifies real-time, symptomatic concussion in youth athletes. Scores in concussed players may remain abnormal over time. Athletes should undergo preseason and postseason K-D testing, with additional evaluation real time to inform the assessment of suspected concussion. Classification of Evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that the K-D test accurately identifies real-time concussions in youth athletes.",King-Devick Test identifies real-time concussion and asymptomatic concussion in youth athletes.

Participants classified with mild, moderate, severe, and extreme severity of AN based on their measured body mass index, differed significantly from each other in eating disorder features, putative maintenance factors, and illness-specific functional impairment (medium effect sizes). However, they were statistically indistinguishable in psychiatric-disorder comorbidity and distress, demographics, and age-of-AN onset. The implications of our findings, providing limited support for the DSM-5 severity ratings for AN, and directions for future research are outlined.",Evaluation of the DSM-5 severity ratings for anorexia nervosa in a clinical sample.
"AIMS: Examine barriers for taking glucose-lowering oral medications, associated baseline characteristics, strategies used, and the adherence impact in the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study. METHODS: We studied youth prescribed oral diabetes medications over two years (N=611, 583, and 525 at 6, 12, and 24months). Clinicians documented barriers (e.g. forgetting, routines, other concerns) in the subsample that reported missed doses (N=423 [69.2%], 422 [72.4%], and 414 [78.9%] at 6, 12, and 24months, respectively). Adherence strategies were also assessed (e.g. family, schedule, reminder device) using standard questions. Logistic regression was used to analyze associations with medication adherence. RESULTS: Those missing doses were not different from the total sample (61.5% female, 13.9+/-2.0years, >80% racial/ethnic minorities). No baseline demographic or clinical predictors of barriers to medication adherence were identified. Among those for whom barriers were assessed, ""forgetting"" with no reason named (39.3%) and disruptions to mealtime, sleep, and schedule (21.9%) accounted for the largest proportion of responses. Family support was the primary adherence strategy identified by most youth (>/=50%), followed by pairing the medication regimen with daily routines (>40%); the latter strategy was associated with significantly higher adherence rates (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Family supported medication adherence was common in this mid-adolescent cohort, but self-management strategies were also in evidence. Findings are similar to those reported among youth with other serious chronic diseases. Prospective studies of multi-component family support and self-management interventions for improving medication adherence are warranted.

"OBJECTIVE: To develop targeted interventions for high-risk drinkers among South African men, we assessed whether sociodemographic factors and history of childhood sexual abuse predicted binge drinking at six-month follow-up assessment and their psychological pathways according to the extended Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). DESIGN: Survey responses with a sample of 1181 South African men from randomly selected neighbourhoods in Eastern Cape Province were collected at baseline and six-month follow-up. Multiple logistic regression analysis examined the baseline predictors of binge drinking. Serial multiple mediation analysis examined the psychological pathways. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Binge drinking at six-month follow-up. RESULTS: Age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.05), religious participation (OR = .73, CI: .65, .82) and history of childhood sexual abuse (OR = 1.82, CI: 1.32, 2.51) were significant predictors of binge drinking. Predictions of religious participation and history of childhood sexual abuse were partially mediated through attitude, subjective norm, descriptive norm and intention to binge drinking. CONCLUSION: South African men with childhood sexual abuse experience and low religious participation were at higher risk for binge drinking. The extended TRA model explains the associations of these factors to binge drinking and can contribute to the design and evaluation of interventions.",Predictors and psychological pathways for binge drinking among South African men.
"Sleep patterns change with aging, independent of other factors, and include advanced sleep timing, shortened nocturnal sleep duration, increased frequency of daytime naps, increased number of nocturnal awakenings and time spent awake during the night, and decreased slow wave sleep. Most of these changes seem to occur between young and middle adulthood; sleep parameters remain largely unchanged among healthy older adults. The circadian system and sleep homeostatic mechanisms become less robust with normal aging. The amount and pattern of sleep-related hormone secretion change as well. The causes of sleep disturbances in older adults are multifactorial.",Sleep in Normal Aging.

"Osteoclast-rich undifferentiated carcinoma of the urinary tract (ORUCUT) is a rare tumor composed of ovoid to spindle-shaped mononuclear cells with intermixed or focally clustered osteoclast-like giant cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that the mononuclear cells are neoplastic cells, while the giant cells are reactive cells of histiocytic lineage. The association between these tumors and classic urothelial carcinomas suggest that the mononuclear cells are derived from urothelial cells; however, no studies have been conducted to assess the immunohistochemical profile of ORUCUT with more specific urothelial markers. This study identified 21 cases of ORUCUT and performed immunohistochemistry for GATA3, uroplakin II, and thrombomodulin along with pancytokeratin (AE1/3) on all cases. Mononuclear cells stained positive in 20 cases (95%) for GATA3 and 19 cases (90%) for thrombomodulin. None of the mononuclear cells were positive for uroplakin II and only three cases showed focal positivity for AE1/3. The osteoclast-like giant cells were negative for GATA3, uroplakin II, thrombomodulin, and AE1/3, providing additional support to a reactive origin for these cells. Additionally, 15 cases (71%) were associated with either in situ or invasive urothelial carcinoma. This study provides an expanded immunohistochemical profile for ORUCUT and more definitively supports a urothelial origin for this tumor.",An expanded immunohistochemical profile of osteoclast-rich undifferentiated carcinoma of the urinary tract.
"BACKGROUND: As part of a program to develop a novel estradiol-releasing contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR), we evaluated the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CVRs releasing segesterone acetate (Nestorone(R) (NES)) combined with one of three different estradiol (E2) doses. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, multi-centered study to evaluate a 90-day CVR releasing NES [200mcg/day] plus E2, either 10mcg/day, 20mcg/day, or 40mcg/day in healthy reproductive-age women with regular cycles. Participants provided blood samples twice weekly for NES and E2 levels during the first 60 days (ring 1) and the last 30 days (ring 2) of use. A subset underwent formal PK assessments at ring initiation, ring exchange (limited PK), and study completion. RESULTS: The main study enrolled 197 women; 22 participated in the PK substudy. Baseline characteristics between the main and PK participants were comparable, with an average BMI of 25.8 kg/m(2) (SD 4.3). In the PK substudy, all three rings showed similar NES PK: mean area under the curve (AUC(0-72)) 34,181 pg*day/mL; concentration maximum (Cmax) 918 pg/mL; time to maximum concentration (Tmax) 3.5 h. For E2, the Cmax occurred at 2 h, and was significantly higher with the 20 mcg/day ring (mean 390 pg/mL); 10 mcg/day, 189 pg/mL, p=.003; 40 mcg/day, 189 pg/mL, p<.001), and declined rapidly to</=50 pg/mL for all doses by 24 h. For all subjects, the median E2 levels remained under 35 pg/mL during treatment. CONCLUSION: PK parameters of NES were not affected when paired with different doses of E2, but E2 levels from all three doses were lower than anticipated and no dose response was observed. IMPLICATIONS: While these novel estradiol-releasing combination contraceptive vaginal rings provided sustained release of contraceptive levels of Nestorone over 90 days, the E2 levels achieved were not consistent with bone protection, and a dose-response was not observed.",Continuous dosing of a novel contraceptive vaginal ring releasing Nestorone(R) and estradiol: pharmacokinetics from a dose-finding study.
"In these studies, we evaluated the contribution of the NLRP3 inflammasome to Crohn's disease (CD) in a kindred containing individuals having a missense mutation in CARD8, a protein known to inhibit this inflammasome. Whole exome sequencing and PCR studies identified the affected individuals as having a V44I mutation in a single allele of the T60 isoform of CARD8. The serum levels of IL-1beta in the affected individuals were increased compared with those in healthy controls, and their peripheral monocytes produced increased amounts of IL-1beta when stimulated by NLRP3 activators. Immunoblot studies probing the basis of these findings showed that mutated T60 CARD8 failed to downregulate the NLRP3 inflammasome because it did not bind to NLRP3 and inhibit its oligomerization. In addition, these studies showed that mutated T60 CARD8 exerted a dominant-negative effect by its capacity to bind to and form oligomers with unmutated T60 or T48 CARD8 that impeded their binding to NLRP3. Finally, inflammasome activation studies revealed that intact but not mutated CARD8 prevented NLRP3 deubiquitination and serine dephosphorylation. CD due to a CARD8 mutation was not effectively treated by anti-TNF-alpha, but did respond to IL-1beta inhibitors. Thus, patients with anti-TNF-alpha-resistant CD may respond to this treatment option.",Loss-of-function CARD8 mutation causes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and Crohn's disease.

"Heavy and radioisotope labeling are commonly used methods to trace the pharmacological activity and metabolic fate of a biochemical or pharmaceutical in vivo. Recent years witnessed increased demand for molecules uniformly labeled with heavy carbon-13 (U-(13)C) or radioactive carbon-14 (U-(14)C) isotopes over singly labeled isotopic versions. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) represent one classic example where uniform (13)C or (14)C isotopic enrichment of the hydrocarbon backbone has numerous technical, metabolic and pharmacological advantages. PUFAs are usually produced in fungi or algae and uniform (13)C or (14)C enrichment of the hydrocarbon chain is achieved by feeding the microorganism a suitable U-(13)C or U-(14)C substrate. Previous literature methods describing the biosynthesis of U-(13)C or U-(14)C fatty acids reported variable isotopic enrichments that were less than anticipated and suffered from inconsistent growth of the microorganism due to radiotoxicity. In the present study, a single-tube method is described for the biosynthesis and extraction of U-(13)C and U-(14)C arachidonic acid (AA), a standard PUFA, from microcultures of the soil fungus Mortierella alpina. To produce U-(13)C-AA, a suspension of fungal spores and mycelial fragments was directly inoculated and grown into submerged cultures in a medium composed of U-(13)C-glucose and NaNO3 as the respective and only sources of carbon and nitrogen. The total (13)C enrichment of AA was in excess of 95% and the percentage of U-(13)C-AA was in the range of 60-70%. These values have not been surpassed by previously reported methods. To produce U-(14)C-AA, the procedure was modified to limit the radiotoxic effects of (14)C on fungal growth. Submerged cultures were initially grown on common (12)C-glucose. Then, following glucose depletion, the biomass was collected and immediately cultured on U-(14)C-glucose. This approach is unprecedented in reported literature and has significantly limited the radiotoxic effects of (14)C on the microorganism. Biomass transfer from (12)C to (14)C substrates was timed to keep an uninterrupted supply of carbon required to sustain the microorganism in the fatty acid synthesis mode and suppress beta-oxidation, a metabolic status that is prerequisite for enhanced isotopic purity of the (14)C product. The specific activity of (14)C enriched AA was estimated at 864Ci/mol (range of 708-1020Ci/mol) suggesting 69.2% (range of 56.7-81.7%) (14)C enrichment along the AA hydrocarbon backbone. The present method used a single tube for microbial culture and lipid extraction to minimize manipulative losses and oxidative degradation of the labeled products. Production cost is comparatively cheaper to custom labeling and yields of U-(13)C and U-(14)C-AA are comparable to literature methods and sufficient for small scale in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies.",Single-tube biosynthesis and extraction of U-(13)C and U-(14)C arachidonic acid from microcultures of Mortierella alpina for in vivo pharmacology and metabolic tracing studies.

"Although many valid pain-related assessment instruments and interventions exist, little is known about which are actually utilized in practice and the factors that contribute to pediatric psychologist's decisions about their use. The aim of this survey study was to present a summary of current clinical practice among pediatric psychologists in the area of pediatric pain and to identify the needs and possible resources that would enable practitioners to better implement evidence-based assessments and interventions. To accomplish this aim, the Pain Special Interest Group of the Society of Pediatric Psychology (SPP) constructed an online survey that was sent electronically to current members of the SPP list serve. Results indicated the majority of participants are guided by a theoretical model and are using evidence-based assessments and interventions, although they are not always familiar with the literature supporting their use. Providers noted evidence-based pain intervention is facilitated by assessment tools, intervention resources, and appreciation of pain interventions by multidisciplinary team members. Barriers are both logistical (clinic space and time constraints) and knowledge-based (lack of familiarity with assessments/interventions). Thus, while pediatric psychologists are progressing towards better translation of research to practice, continued educational efforts and communication among practitioners about available resources are warranted.",Pain Assessment Methods and Interventions Used by Pediatric Psychologists: A Survey by the Pain Special Interest Group of the Society of Pediatric Psychology.
"Youth living with HIV (YLH) experience multiple disease-related stresses along with the same structural and developmental challenges faced by their uninfected peers; alcohol use among YLH represents a risk behavior by virtue of potential effects on youth health and increased likelihood of engaging in unprotected sex while drinking alcohol. Research aimed at better understanding the interplay of individual- and neighborhood-level influences on alcohol use for YLH is needed to inform interventions. This study examined whether socioeconomic disadvantage (SED) and social support influence, independently and through interaction, alcohol use in YLH. Data from the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) consisted of YLH across 538 neighborhoods in the United States who acquired HIV behaviorally. Neighborhood-specific data were compiled from the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau and matched with individual-level data from the ATN (N = 1,357) to examine effects that contribute to variation in frequency of alcohol use. Other drug use, being male, being non-Black, and older age were associated with greater alcohol use. Higher social support was negatively associated with alcohol use frequency. A cross-level interaction indicated that the association found between decreasing social support and increasing alcohol use frequency was weakened in areas with lower SED. Implications are discussed.",Interaction Effects of Neighborhood Disadvantage and Individual Social Support on Frequency of Alcohol Use in Youth Living with HIV.
"BACKGROUND: Sexting, the sharing of sexually suggestive photos, may be a gateway behavior to early sexual activity and increase the likelihood of social ostracism. METHODS: Youth Risk Behavior Survey (N = 6021) data from 2015 among Pennsylvania 9th-12th grade students were used to examine associations between consensual and nonconsensual sexting and substance use, mental health, neighborhood safety, and demographic variables. RESULTS: Almost one-third (29%) of students reported consensual sexting, while 3% reported nonconsensual sexting. Female students were 49% less likely to report consensual sexting (OR = .69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.54, 0.87]); consensual sexting was significantly more likely in students who reported depressive symptoms (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: [1.10, 1.75]), electronic bullying (OR = 1.46, 95% CI: [1.05, 2.04]), suicide attempts (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: [1.22, 3.17]), current tobacco use (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: [1.30, 3.03]), current alcohol use (OR = 4.23, 95% CI: [3.04, 5.89]), ever having sex (OR = 5.21, 95% CI: [3.87, 7.02]), and reported both ever having sex, and current alcohol use (OR = 7.74, 95% CI: [5.37, 11.14]). CONCLUSIONS: High school students, particularly men, that report sexting may be more likely to participate in other risk behaviors and experience negative mental health outcomes.

"INTRODUCTION: Prior studies of outcomes following genitoplasty have reported high rates of surgical complications among children with atypical genitalia. Few studies have prospectively assessed outcomes after contemporary surgical approaches. OBJECTIVE: The current study reported the occurrence of early postoperative complications and of cosmetic outcomes (as rated by surgeons and parents) at 12 months following contemporary genitoplasty procedures in children born with atypical genitalia. STUDY DESIGN: This 11-site, prospective study included children aged </=2 years, with Prader 3-5 or Quigley 3-6 external genitalia, with no prior genitoplasty and non-urogenital malformations at the time of enrollment. Genital appearance was rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Paired t-tests evaluated differences in cosmesis ratings. RESULTS: Out of 27 children, 10 were 46,XY patients with the following diagnoses: gonadal dysgenesis, PAIS or testosterone biosynthetic defect, severe hypospadias and microphallus, who were reared male. Sixteen 46,XX congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients were reared female and one child with sex chromosome mosaicism was reared male. Eleven children had masculinizing genitoplasty for penoscrotal or perineal hypospadias (one-stage, three; two-stage, eight). Among one-stage surgeries, one child had meatal stenosis (minor) and one developed both urinary retention (minor) and urethrocutaneous fistula (major) (Summary Figure). Among two-stage surgeries, three children developed a major complication: penoscrotal fistula, glans dehiscence or urethral dehiscence. Among 16 children who had feminizing genitoplasty, vaginoplasty was performed in all, clitoroplasty in nine, external genitoplasty in 13, urethroplasty in four, perineoplasty in five, and total urogenital sinus mobilization in two. Two children had minor complications: one had a UTI, and one had both a mucosal skin tag and vaginal mucosal polyp. Two additional children developed a major complication: vaginal stenosis. Cosmesis scores revealed sustained improvements from 6 months post-genitoplasty, as previously reported, with all scores reported as good or satisfied. DISCUSSION: In these preliminary data from a multi-site, observational study, parents and surgeons were equally satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes 12 months after genitoplasty. A small number of patients had major complications in both feminizing and masculinizing surgeries; two-stage hypospadias repair had the most major complications. Long-term follow-up of patients at post-puberty will provide a better assessment of outcomes in this population. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of children with moderate to severe atypical genitalia, preliminary data on both surgical and cosmetic outcomes were presented. Findings from this study, and from following these children in long-term studies, will help guide practitioners in their discussions with families about surgical management.",Preliminary report: Surgical outcomes following genitoplasty in children with moderate to severe genital atypia.
"BACKGROUND: There is no standard nor widely accepted way of reporting outcomes of treatment of biliary injuries. This hinders comparison of results among approaches and among centers. This paper presents a proposal to standardize terminology and reporting of results of treating biliary injuries. METHODS: The proposal was developed by an international group of surgeons, biliary endoscopists and interventional radiologists. The method is based on the concept of ""patency"" and is similar to the approach used to create reporting standards for arteriovenous hemodialysis access. RESULTS: The group considered definitions and gradings under the following headings: Definition of Patency, Definition of Index Treatment Periods, Grading of Severity of Biliary Injury, Grading of Patency, Metrics, Comparison of Surgical to Non Surgical Treatments and Presentation of Case Series. CONCLUSIONS: A standard procedure for reporting outcomes of treating biliary injuries has been produced. It is applicable to presenting results of treatment by surgery, endoscopy, and interventional radiology.",Proposed standards for reporting outcomes of treating biliary injuries.

"BACKGROUND: Despite a tremendous amount of information on the role of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease (AD), almost all clinical trials testing this hypothesis have failed to generate clinically relevant cognitive effects. METHODS: We present an advanced mechanism-based and biophysically realistic quantitative systems pharmacology computer model of an Alzheimer-type neuronal cortical network that has been calibrated with Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) readouts from historical clinical trials and simulated the differential impact of amyloid-beta (Abeta40 and Abeta42) oligomers on glutamate and nicotinic neurotransmission. RESULTS: Preclinical data suggest a beneficial effect of shorter Abeta forms within a limited dose range. Such a beneficial effect of Abeta40 on glutamate neurotransmission in human patients is absolutely necessary to reproduce clinical data on the ADAS-Cog in minimal cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with and without amyloid load, the effect of APOE genotype effect on the slope of the cognitive trajectory over time in placebo AD patients and higher sensitivity to cholinergic manipulation with scopolamine associated with higher Abeta in MCI subjects. We further derive a relationship between units of Abeta load in our model and the standard uptake value ratio from amyloid imaging. When introducing the documented clinical pharmacodynamic effects on Abeta levels for various amyloid-related clinical interventions in patients with low Abeta baseline, the platform predicts an overall significant worsening for passive vaccination with solanezumab, beta-secretase inhibitor verubecestat and gamma-secretase inhibitor semagacestat. In contrast, all three interventions improved cognition in subjects with moderate to high baseline Abeta levels, with verubecestat anticipated to have the greatest effect (around ADAS-Cog value 1.5 points), solanezumab the lowest (0.8 ADAS-Cog value points) and semagacestat in between. This could explain the success of many amyloid interventions in transgene animals with an artificial high level of Abeta, but not in AD patients with a large variability of amyloid loads. CONCLUSIONS: If these predictions are confirmed in post-hoc analyses of failed clinical amyloid-modulating trials, one should question the rationale behind testing these interventions in early and prodromal subjects with low or zero amyloid load.",Impact of amyloid-beta changes on cognitive outcomes in Alzheimer's disease: analysis of clinical trials using a quantitative systems pharmacology model.

"Choline kinase alpha (ChoKalpha) is an enzyme that is upregulated in many types of cancer and has been shown to be tumorigenic. As such, it makes a promising target for inhibiting tumor growth. Though there have been several inhibitors synthesized for ChoKalpha, not all of them demonstrate the same efficacy in vivo, though the reasons behind this difference in potency are not clear. One particular inhibitor, designated TCD-717, has recently completed phase I clinical trials. Cell culture and in vitro studies support the powerful inhibitory effect TCD-717 has on ChoKalpha, but an examination of the inhibitor's interaction with the ChoKalpha enzyme has been missing prior to this work. Here we detail the 2.35 A structure of ChoKalpha in complex with TCD-717. Examination of this structure in conjunction with kinetic assays reveals that TCD-717 does not bind directly in the choline pocket as do previously characterized ChoKalpha inhibitors, but rather in a proximal but novel location near the surface of the enzyme. The unique binding site identified for TCD-717 lends insight for the future design of more potent in vivo inhibitors for ChoKalpha.",Identification of a Unique Inhibitor-Binding Site on Choline Kinase alpha.
"Policy makers have articulated a need for clear, evidence-based guidance to help inform pain policy. Persistent pain is common, expensive, and debilitating, and requires comprehensive assessment and treatment planning. Recently released opioid prescribing guidelines by the CDC (2016) emphasize the importance of using nonopioid therapies before considering opioid treatment for those without a malignant illness. The National Pain Strategy (2016) underscores the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary pain care. Unfortunately, despite persuasive evidence supporting the efficacy of psychosocial approaches, these interventions are inaccessible to the majority of Americans. Psychosocial approaches to pain management should be available for all individuals with persistent pain and in all health care settings and contexts as part of the comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to pain care as outlined in the National Pain Strategy.

This was a randomized cross-over study of 9 lean insulin-sensitive (mean+/-SEM HOMA-IR 0.83+/-0.10) and 9 obese insulin-resistant (HOMA-IR 4.34+/-0.41) young (age 21-40 years), normoglycaemic Chinese men. We measured fasting and postprandial plasma concentration of glucose, insulin, active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), total peptide-YY (PYY), and acyl-ghrelin in response to HP, HF, or HC meals. Overall postprandial plasma insulin response was more robust in the lean compared to obese subjects. The postprandial GLP-1 response after HF or HP meal was higher than HC meal in both lean and obese subjects. In obese subjects, HF meal induced higher response in postprandial PYY compared to HC meal. HP and HF meals also suppressed ghrelin greater compared to HC meal in the obese than lean subjects. In conclusion, a high-protein or high-fat meal induces a more favorable postprandial satiety and appetite hormonal response than a high-carbohydrate meal in obese insulin-resistant subjects.","A high carbohydrate, but not fat or protein meal attenuates postprandial ghrelin, PYY and GLP-1 responses in Chinese men."
"PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of timing of surgery and spring characteristics on correction of scaphocephalic deformity in patients undergoing spring-mediated cranioplasty (SMC) for sagittal craniosynostosis. METHODS: The authors conducted a review of patients with sagittal craniosynostosis who underwent SMC at a tertiary referral center between July 2011 and March 2017, with a primary outcome measure of head shape, both preoperatively and postoperatively, determined by cephalic index (CI). Patient demographics and operative details including timing of surgery and spring characteristics were collected. Differences in CI preoperation and postoperation were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Ordinary least-squares linear regression was used to assess the impact of timing, number of springs, maximum single spring force, and total spring force on postoperative change in CI. RESULTS: Thirty-six subjects (12 males and 24 females) were included in the study. Mean age at spring placement was 3.9 months (range: 1.9-9.2) with a mean follow-up of 1.4 years (range: 0.3-5.2). The mean number of springs used was 3 (range: 2-4). The mean maximum single spring force was 9.9 Newtons (N) (range: 6.9-13.0) and the mean total spring force was 24.6 N (range: 12.7-37.0). Mean CI increased from 70 +/- 0.9 preoperatively to 77 +/- 1.0 postoperatively (P < 0.001). Age at spring placement was significantly associated with change in CI: for every month increase in age, the change in CI decreased by 1.3 (P = 0.03). The number of springs used, greatest single spring force, and total spring force did not correlate with changes in CI (P = 0.85, P = 0.42, and P = 0.84, respectively). CONCLUSION: In SMC, earlier age at time of surgery appears to correlate with greater improvement in CI, at least in the short-term. While spring characteristics did not appear to affect head shape, it is possible that the authors were underpowered to detect a difference, and spring-related variables likely deserve additional study.",Spring-Mediated Cranioplasty in Sagittal Synostosis: Does Age at Placement Affect Expansion?
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic respiratory diseases affecting adults and children are widely prevalent, so lung function testing is imperative for diagnosis and management. Spirometry is the traditional standard measure of lung function; however, certain groups of patients are unable to provide accurate and reproducible exhalation maneuvers. Consequently, the impedance oscillometry system (IOS) has been developed as an effort, independent technique to assess airway function in children and the elderly. To better understand this emerging modality, the following review will compare IOS with spirometry, examine the function of the device, provide interpretation strategies, and discuss the evidence supporting its use in adults and children with chronic lung disease. RECENT FINDINGS: In a population of symptomatic adults with suspected COPD, impedance oscillometry resistance measurements correlate with FEV1 and lung resistance increases with the severity of airflow limitation. In patients with asthma, IOS is a sensitive measure of airway hyperresponsiveness and bronchodilator response. Impedance oscillometry is evolving as an alternative measure to assess lung function pediatric and adult populations.",Impedance Oscillometry: Emerging Role in the Management of Chronic Respiratory Disease.
"AIM: To describe factors associated with transfer from paediatric to adult care and poor glycaemic control among young adults with Type 2 diabetes, using the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study. METHODS: Young adults with Type 2 diabetes were included if they had a baseline SEARCH visit while in paediatric care at < 18 years and >/= 1 follow-up SEARCH visit thereafter at 18-25 years. At each visit, HbA1c , BMI, self-reported demographic and healthcare provider data were collected. Associations of demographic factors with transfer of care and poor glycaemic control (HbA1c >/= 75 mmol/mol; 9.0%) were explored with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: 182 young adults with Type 2 diabetes (36% male, 75% minority, 87% with obesity) were included. Most (n = 102, 56%) reported transfer to adult care at follow-up; a substantial proportion (n = 28, 15%) reported no care and 29% did not transfer. Duration of diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1, 1.8] and age at diagnosis (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4, 2.4) predicted leaving paediatric care. Transfer to adult or no care was associated with a higher likelihood of poor glycaemic control at follow-up (adult: OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.8, 11.2; none: OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.4, 14.6), independent of sex, age, race/ethnicity or baseline HbA1c level. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with Type 2 diabetes exhibit worsening glycaemic control and loss to follow-up during the transfer from paediatric to adult care. Our study highlights the need for development of tailored clinical programmes and healthcare system policies to support the growing population of young adults with youth-onset Type 2 diabetes.",Transfer from paediatric to adult care for young adults with Type 2 diabetes: the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study.

"BACKGROUND: Transition from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to home is challenging for caregivers of complex surgical infants. A prospective, observational cohort pilot study using telemedicine to improve transition was implemented in a quaternary level IV NICU. PURPOSE: (1) To assess, identify, and resolve patient care concerns in the immediate postdischarge period. (2) To improve caregiver knowledge and care practices. DESIGN METHODS: Caregivers of medically complex infants participated in telemedicine visits with neonatal providers within 1 week of discharge. Providers reviewed infant health, equipment use, and outpatient follow-up. Video was used to visualize the infant, home environment, and care practices. Caregivers completed a postvisit satisfaction survey. RESULTS: Ninety-three visits were performed from May 2015 to March 2017. Seventy-six percent of visits were postsurgery patients. Seventy-eight postdischarge issues were identified: medication administration (13%), respiratory (19%), feeding (33%), and surgical site (35%). Fifty percent of caregivers reported that telemedicine visits prevented an additional call or visit to a clinician; 12% prompted an earlier visit (n = 93). Caregiver satisfaction rating was high. Median estimation of total mileage saved by respondents was 1755 miles. CONCLUSIONS: Postdischarge telemedicine visits with complex surgical NICU graduates identify clinical issues, provide caregivers with support, and save travel time. Advanced practice nurses are instrumental in patient recruitment, with patient visits, and in providing postdischarge continuity of care. Barriers to implementation were identified. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: A randomized controlled study is warranted to measure the value of telemedicine visits for specific patient cohorts.",Complex Surgical Infants Benefit From Postdischarge Telemedicine Visits.
"BACKGROUND: Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) and esophageal atresia (EA) are rare anomalies in neonates. Up to 50% of neonates with TEF/EA will have Vertebral anomalies (V), Anal atresia (A), Cardiac anomalies (C), Tracheoesophageal fistula (T), Esophageal atresia (E), Renal anomalies (R), and Limb anomalies (L) (VACTERL) association, which has the potential to cause serious morbidity. PURPOSE: Timely management of the neonate can greatly impact the infant's overall outcome. Spreading latest evidence-based knowledge and sharing practical experience with clinicians across various levels of the neonatal intensive care unit and well-baby units have the potential to decrease the rate of morbidity and mortality. METHODS/SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Review, and Google Scholar were used to search key words- tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, TEF/EA, VACTERL, long gap, post-operative management, NICU, pediatric surgery-for articles that were relevant and current. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Advancements in both technology and medicine have helped identify and decrease postsurgical complications. More understanding and clarity are needed to manage acid suppression and its effects in a timely way. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Knowing the clinical signs of potential TEF/EA, clinicians can initiate preoperative management and expedite transfer to a hospital with pediatric surgeons who are experts in TEF/EA management to prevent long-term morbidity. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Various methods of perioperative management exist, and future studies should look into standardizing perioperative care. Other areas of research should include acid suppression recommendation, reducing long-term morbidity seen in patients with TEF/EA, postoperative complications, and how we can safely and effectively decrease the length of time to surgery for long-gap atresia in neonates.",Basic Knowledge of Tracheoesophageal Fistula and Esophageal Atresia.
"BACKGROUND: Consumer credit may reflect financial hardship that patients face due to cancer treatment, which in turn may impact ability to manage health after cancer; however, credit's relationship to economic burden and health after cancer has not been evaluated. METHODS: From May to September 2015, 123 women with a history of breast cancer residing in Pennsylvania or New Jersey completed a cross-sectional survey of demographics, socioeconomic position, comorbidities, SF-12 self-rated health, economic burden since cancer diagnosis, psychosocial stress, and self-reported (poor to excellent) credit quality. Ordinal logistic regression evaluated credit's contribution to economic burden and self-rated health. RESULTS: Mean respondent age was 64 years. Mean year from diagnosis was 11.5. Forty percent of respondents were Black or Other and 60% were White. Twenty-four percent self-reported poor credit, and 76% reported good to excellent credit quality. In adjusted models, changing income, using savings, borrowing money, and being unable to purchase a health need since cancer were associated with poorer credit. Better credit was associated with 7.72 ([1.22, 14.20], p = 0.02) higher physical health t-score, and a - 2.00 ([- 3.92, - 0.09], p = 0.04) point change in psychosocial stress. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory analysis establishes the premise for consumer credit as a marker of economic burden and health for breast cancer survivors. Future work should validate these findings in larger samples and for other health conditions. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Stabilizing and monitoring consumer credit may be a potential intervention point for mitigating economic burden after breast cancer.",Consumer credit as a novel marker for economic burden and health after cancer in a diverse population of breast cancer survivors in the USA.

"Mammalian sleep consists of distinct rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) states. The midbrain region ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is known to be important for gating REM sleep, but the underlying neuronal mechanism is not well understood. Here, we show that activating vlPAG GABAergic neurons in mice suppresses the initiation and maintenance of REM sleep while consolidating NREM sleep, partly through their projection to the dorsolateral pons. Cell-type-specific recording and calcium imaging reveal that most vlPAG GABAergic neurons are strongly suppressed at REM sleep onset and activated at its termination. In addition to the rapid changes at brain state transitions, their activity decreases gradually between REM sleep and is reset by each REM episode in a duration-dependent manner, mirroring the accumulation and dissipation of REM sleep pressure. Thus, vlPAG GABAergic neurons powerfully gate REM sleep, and their firing rate modulation may contribute to the ultradian rhythm of REM/NREM alternation.",Regulation of REM and Non-REM Sleep by Periaqueductal GABAergic Neurons.
"Resolution of leishmaniasis depends upon parasite control and limiting inflammation. CD4(+) Th1 cells are required to control parasites, whereas CD8(+) T cells play a dual role: they promote Th1 cell differentiation but can also increase inflammation at the site of infection as a consequence of cytolysis. Although CD8(+) T cells taken from leishmanial lesions are cytolytic, in this study, we showed that only a few CD8(+) T cells produced IFN-gamma. Correspondingly, only low levels of IL-12 and/or IL-12 mRNA were present in lesions from infected mice, as well as patients. Addition of IL-12 increased IFN-gamma production by CD8(+) T cells isolated from leishmanial lesions, suggesting that a lack of IL-12 at the site of infection limits IFN-gamma production by CD8(+) T cells. To determine whether CD8(+) T cells could promote resistance in vivo if IL-12 was present, we administered IL-12 to Leishmania-infected RAG mice reconstituted with CD8(+) T cells. IL-12 treatment increased the ability of CD8(+) T cells to make IFN-gamma, but CD8(+) T cells still failed to control the parasites. Furthermore, despite the ability of CD8(+) T cells to promote immunity to secondary infections, we also found that CD8(+) T cells from immune mice were unable to control Leishmania in RAG mice. Taken together, these results indicate that lesional CD8(+) T cells fail to make IFN-gamma because of a deficit in IL-12 but that, even with IL-12, CD8(+) T cells are unable to control Leishmania in the absence of CD4(+) T cells.",CD8(+) T Cells Lack Local Signals To Produce IFN-gamma in the Skin during Leishmania Infection.
"Choriocarcinoma is part of the spectrum of gestational trophoblastic disease that occurs in women of reproductive age. Although the most common metastatic site of choriocarcinoma is the lung, primary pulmonary choriocarcinoma is rare. To diagnose primary pulmonary choriocarcinoma, the patient should have no previous gynecologic malignancy, have elevated human chorionic gonadotropin, and have pathological confirmation of the disease excluding gonadal primary site of the tumor. Due to the paucity of data, there are no guidelines for treatment. Prognosis of this malignancy is extremely poor. We report a rare case of metastatic primary lung choriocarcinoma in a 69-year-old postmenopausal woman who was treated with combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The patient had a good outcome and is doing well after 1-year follow-up.",A Rare Case of Metastatic Choriocarcinoma of Lung Origin.
,Obstructive sleep apnea drug therapy: apnea-hypopnea index leaves us high and dry.
"Coordinated rhythmic movements are ubiquitous in animal behavior. In many organisms, chains of neural oscillators underlie the generation of these rhythms. In C. elegans, locomotor wave generation has been poorly understood; in particular, it is unclear where in the circuit rhythms are generated, and whether there exists more than one such generator. We used optogenetic and ablation experiments to probe the nature of rhythm generation in the locomotor circuit. We found that multiple sections of forward locomotor circuitry are capable of independently generating rhythms. By perturbing different components of the motor circuit, we localize the source of secondary rhythms to cholinergic motor neurons in the midbody. Using rhythmic optogenetic perturbation, we demonstrate bidirectional entrainment of oscillations between different body regions. These results show that, as in many other vertebrates and invertebrates, the C. elegans motor circuit contains multiple oscillators that coordinate activity to generate behavior.",Distributed rhythm generators underlie Caenorhabditis elegans forward locomotion.
"Tissue PCO values have not been previously estimated under conditions where the blood carboxyhemoglobin % saturation ([COHb]) is at a normal level or increased. Tissue PCO values are not known for conditions when [COHb] is increased during CO therapy or during CO poisoning. Using a modified Krogh parallel capillary-tissue model, mean tissue PCO was calculated for when [COHb] was 1, 5, 10, and 15% saturation, relevant to CO therapy, and 20, 30, and 40% saturation, relevant to CO poisoning. Calculations were made for the time during which CO was being inhaled, after cessation of CO uptake, and for different O2 extractions from blood flowing in the model capillary. The T1/2 of relevant CO reactions was used in these calculations. When the [COHb] increased to 5 to 10% saturation, mean tissue PCO values increased to 500 to 1,100% of values when the [COHb] was 1% saturation. When the [COHb] increased to 20 to 40% saturation, mean tissue PCO values increased to 2,300 to 5,700% of the 1% saturation value. Results indicate the utility of the modified Krogh model in furthering understanding the physiology of determinants of tissue PCO and should facilitate future studies of in vivo CO binding to different extravascular heme proteins during CO therapy and during CO poisoning. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Tissue PCO levels resulting from carboxyhemoglobin concentrations achieved during CO therapy or during CO poisoning have not been previously estimated. Results published here show that at carboxyhemoglobin levels achieved during CO therapy there are 500 to 1,100% increases in mean tissue PCO values. With carboxyhemoglobin increases associated with toxic effects, there are 2,300 to 5,700% increases in the mean tissue PCO. These differences suggest a basis for understanding the therapeutic and toxic effects of CO.",The partial pressure of carbon monoxide in human tissues calculated using a parallel capillary-tissue cylinder model.
"A persistent change in illumination causes light-adaptive changes in retinal neurons. Light adaptation improves visual encoding by preventing saturation and by adjusting spatiotemporal integration to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and utilize signaling bandwidth efficiently. In dim light, the visual input contains a greater relative amount of quantal noise, and vertebrate receptive fields are extended in space and time to increase SNR. Whereas in bright light, SNR of the visual input is high, the rate of synaptic vesicle release from the photoreceptors is low so that quantal noise in synaptic output may limit SNR postsynaptically. Whether and how reduced synaptic SNR impacts spatiotemporal integration in postsynaptic neurons remains unclear. To address this, we measured spatiotemporal integration in retinal horizontal cells and ganglion cells in the guinea pig retina across a broad illumination range, from low to high photopic levels. In both cell types, the extent of spatial and temporal integration changed according to an inverted U-shaped function consistent with adaptation to low SNR at both low and high light levels. We show how a simple mechanistic model with interacting, opponent filters can generate the observed changes in ganglion cell spatiotemporal receptive fields across light-adaptive states and postulate that retinal neurons postsynaptic to the cones in bright light adopt low-pass spatiotemporal response characteristics to improve visual encoding under conditions of low synaptic SNR.",Impact of light-adaptive mechanisms on mammalian retinal visual encoding at high light levels.
"Obese and overweight youth are at an increased risk for poor peer relations and psychosocial adjustment. Of particular concern is the high rate of bullying victimization experienced by obese and overweight youth. While it is known that victimized youth are at an increased risk for internalizing symptoms, few studies have examined if weight status exacerbates the association between victimization and internalizing symptoms. The current study drew upon data from over 43,000 youth attending 107 middle and high schools. Multilevel results suggested that compared with normal weight youth, both overweight and obese youth were at an increased risk for experiencing relational, verbal, and cyber victimization, with only obese youth being at an increased risk for experiencing physical victimization. Notably, the odds for experiencing cyber victimization were higher than the odds for experiencing other forms of victimization. Frequently victimized obese youth, but not frequently victimized overweight youth, had significantly higher levels of internalizing symptoms compared to their frequently victimized, normal-weight peers. Together, these findings highlight the increased risk for psychosocial adjustment problems among frequently victimized overweight and obese youth, suggesting these youth may require preventive interventions tailored to meet their unique needs.

"BACKGROUND: How hospital case-volume affects operative outcomes and cost continues to grow in importance. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of case volume with operative outcomes and cost in cleft palate repair. METHODS: Subjects undergoing cleft palate repair between 2004 and 2015 were identified in the Pediatric Health Information System. Outcomes were compared between two groups: those undergoing treatment at a high-volume institution, and those undergoing treatment at a low-volume institution. Primary outcomes were as follows: any complication, prolonged length of stay, and increased total cost. RESULTS: Over 20,000 patients (n = 20,320) from 49 institutions met inclusion criteria. On univariate analysis, those subjects who underwent treatment at a high-volume institution had a lower rate of overall complications (3.4 percent versus 5.1 percent; p < 0.001), and lower rates of prolonged length of stay (4.5 percent versus 5.8 percent; p < 0.001) and increased total cost (48.6 percent versus 50.9 percent; p = 0.002). In multivariate regression analyses, subjects treated in high-volume centers were less likely to experience any complication (OR, 0.678; p < 0.001) and were less likely to have an extended length of stay (OR, 0.82; p = 0.005). Subjects undergoing palate repair at a high-volume institution were no less likely to incur increased total cost (OR, 1.01; p = 0.805). CONCLUSION: In institutions performing a high volume of cleft palate repairs, subjects had significantly decreased odds of experiencing a complication or prolonged length of stay.

"Background: Inappropriate ordering and acquisition of urine cultures leads to unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Treatment of ASB contributes to antimicrobial resistance particularly among hospital-acquired organisms. Our objective was to investigate urine culture ordering and collection practices among nurses to identify key system-level and human factor barriers and facilitators that affect optimal ordering and collection practices. Methods: We conducted two focus groups, one with ED nurses and the other with ICU nurses. Questions were developed using the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework. We used iterative categorization (directed content analysis followed by summative content analysis) to code and analyze the data both deductively (using SEIPS domains) and inductively (emerging themes). Results: Factors affecting optimal urine ordering and collection included barriers at the person, process, and task levels. For ED nurses, barriers included patient factors, physician communication, reflex culture protocols, the electronic health record, urinary symptoms, and ED throughput. For ICU nurses, barriers included physician notification of urinalysis results, personal protective equipment, collection technique, patient body habitus, and Foley catheter issues. Conclusions: We identified multiple potential process barriers to nurse adherence with evidence-based recommendations for ordering and collecting urine cultures in the ICU and ED. A systems approach to identifying barriers and facilitators can be useful to design interventions for improving urine ordering and collection practices.",Reducing unnecessary culturing: a systems approach to evaluating urine culture ordering and collection practices among nurses in two acute care settings.
"The known functions of the human GCOM1 complex hub gene include transcription elongation and the intercalated disk of cardiac myocytes. However, in all likelihood, the gene's most interesting, and thus far least understood, roles will be found in the central nervous system. To investigate the functions of the GCOM1 gene in the CNS, we have cloned human and rat brain cDNAs encoding novel, 105kDa GCOM1 combined (Gcom) proteins, designated Gcom15, and identified a new group of GCOM1 interacting genes, termed Gints, from yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens. We showed that Gcom15 interacts with the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor by co-expression in heterologous cells, in which we observed bi-directional co-immunoprecipitation of human Gcom15 and murine NR1. Our Y2H screens revealed 27 novel GCOM1 interacting genes, many of which are synaptic proteins and/or play roles in neurologic diseases. Finally, we showed, using rat brain protein preparations, that the Gint internexin-alpha (INA), a known interactor of the NMDAR, co-IPs with GCOM1 proteins, suggesting a GCOM1-GRIN1-INA interaction and a novel pathway that may be relevant to neuroprotection.",The human GCOM1 complex gene interacts with the NMDA receptor and internexin-alpha.
"PURPOSE: We observed that many of our helical therapy lung stereotactic body radiation therapy plans did not meet the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recommended R50% (volume of 50% of the prescription dose/planning target volume), which characterizes the steepness of dose fall off. We hypothesized that despite not meeting R50%, helical therapy lung stereotactic body radiation therapy plans would confer similar local control and minimal side effects as previously reported using nonhelical treatment platforms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a retrospective review of all consecutive patients treated off-protocol with stereotactic body radiation therapy for peripheral lung lesions from 2008 to 2013 utilizing helical therapy. Seventy-four patients (81 lesions and 79 plans) were treated with doses ranging from 48 to 60 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions prescribed to the edge of the planning target volume. RESULTS: Forty-eight (61%) plans had major deviation from R50%. Only 1 (<1%) plan had a major deviation from the R100%. All plans had > 95% planning target volume coverage by prescription dose, 7(8.6%) plans with 121% to 133% maximum dose, and lung V20 Gy <10% in 70 (89%) plans. With a median follow-up of 4.7 years (95% confidence interval: 4.1-5.3), local control for all patients at 1, 2, and 5 years was 94.6%, 83.4%, and 74%, respectively. For patients with primary stage I-II lung cancer (n = 46), the 1, 2, and 5-year local control: 97.2%, 94.2%, and 86.9%; RC: 97.6%, 82.5%, and 69.5%; and DM: 3%, 16%, and 33.4%, respectively. Patients treated for lung metastases (n = 26) had worse local control at 1, 2, and 5 years: 94.4%, 69.3%, and 55.5%, respectively. Side effects were rare with 2 (3%) patients reporting chest wall pain and 6 (8%) patients experiencing radiation pneumonitis, including 1 patient who had grade 5 radiation pneumonitis.

Participants (279 verbally-fluent youth aged 8-16 years, NASD = 144, NTD = 135) completed the SASC-R. Youth with ASD exhibited higher social anxiety across informants. While TD youth endorsed higher anxiety than did parents, self- and parent-reports did not differ in youth with ASD. For children with ASD, higher parent-youth agreement was associated with lower lifetime ASD symptoms and higher adaptive skills. For TD youth, agreement on high anxiety was associated with lowest adaptive skills. Demographic factors (age, verbal IQ, gender) did not relate to agreement for either group.

"Homocysteine (Hcy) is a heritable biomarker for CVD, peripheral artery disease, stroke, and dementia. Little is known about genetic associations with Hcy in individuals of African ancestry. We performed a genome-wide association study for Hcy in 4927 AAs from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Coronary Artery Risk in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Analyses were stratified by sex and results were meta-analyzed within and across sex. In the sex-combined meta-analysis, we observed genome-wide significant evidence (p < 5.0 x 10(-8)) for the NOX4 locus (lead variant rs2289125, beta = -0.15, p = 5.3 x 10(11)). While the NOX4 locus was previously reported as associated with Hcy in European-American populations, rs2289125 remained genome-wide significant when conditioned on the previously reported lead variants. Previously reported genome-wide significant associations at NOX4, MTR, CBS, and MMACHC were also nominally (p < 0.050) replicated in AAs. Associations at the CPS1 locus, previously reported in females only, also was replicated specifically in females in this analysis, supporting sex-specific effects for this locus. These results suggest that there may be a combination of cross-population and population-specific genetic effects, as well as differences in genetic effects between males and females, in the regulation of Hcy levels.","Genome-wide association study of homocysteine in African Americans from the Jackson Heart Study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and the Coronary Artery Risk in Young Adults study."

TBI was speculated to reduce orexin neuronal activity through decreased regional excitatory (glutamate) and/or increased inhibitory (GABA) input. Therefore, we hypothesized that TBI would decrease synaptic glutamate and/or increase synaptic GABA in nerve terminals contacting orexin neurons, and BCAA supplementation would restore TBI-induced changes in synaptic glutamate and/or GABA. Methods: Brain tissue was processed for orexin pre-embed diaminobenzidine labeling and glutamate or GABA postembed immunogold labeling. The density of glutamate and GABA immunogold within presynaptic nerve terminals contacting orexin-positive lateral hypothalamic neurons was quantified using electron microscopy in three groups of mice (n = 8 per group): Sham/noninjured controls, TBI without BCAA supplementation, and TBI with BCAA supplementation (given for 5 days, 48 hr post-TBI). Glutamate and GABA were also quantified within the cortical penumbral region (layer VIb) adjacent to the TBI lesion. Results: In the hypothalamus and cortex, TBI decreased relative glutamate density in presynaptic terminals making axodendritic contacts. However, BCAA supplementation only restored relative glutamate density within presynaptic terminals contacting orexin-positive hypothalamic neurons. BCAA supplementation did not change relative glutamate density in presynaptic terminals making axosomatic contacts, or relative GABA density in presynaptic terminals making axosomatic or axodendritic contacts, within either the hypothalamus or cortex. Conclusions: These results suggest TBI compromises orexin neuron function via decreased glutamate density and highlight BCAA supplementation as a potential therapy to restore glutamate density to orexin neurons.",Dietary therapy restores glutamatergic input to orexin/hypocretin neurons after traumatic brain injury in mice.

"microRNAs (miRNAs) are critical for neuronal function and their dysregulation is repeatedly observed in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we implemented high content image analysis for investigating the impact of several miRNAs in mouse primary motor neurons. This survey directed our attention to the neuron-specific miR-124, which controls axonal morphology. By performing next generation sequencing analysis and molecular studies, we characterized novel roles for miR-124 in control of mitochondria localization and function. We further demonstrated that the intermediate filament Vimentin is a key target of miR-124 in this system. Our data establishes a new pathway for control of mitochondria function in motor neurons, revealing the value of a neuron-specific miRNA gene as a mechanism for the re-shaping of otherwise ubiquitously-expressed intermediate filament network, upstream of mitochondria activity and cellular metabolism.",High content image analysis reveals function of miR-124 upstream of Vimentin in regulating motor neuron mitochondria.
"Court-involved youth engage in risky sex behaviors at higher rates than non-offending peers and are at particular risk for adverse sexual health outcomes. Parenting practices, such as parent-child sexual communication and parental monitoring, may protect court-involved youth from engaging in risky sexual behavior. Parent psychological distress and family dysfunction may, however, compromise parenting practices for court-involved youth. This study examined associations among parent mental health symptoms, family functioning, and parenting practices within 157 parent-youth dyads who were court-referred for mental health treatment. Results revealed that greater parent mental health symptoms were directly related to greater family dysfunction and indirectly associated with poorer parental monitoring through worse family functioning. Findings suggest that directly addressing parent mental health needs in family-based adolescent sexual health programming for court-involved youth may be effective in improving parent-child relationships and family processes that support long term sexual health outcomes for adolescents.",The role of family functioning in parenting practices of court-involved youth.
"During sprouting angiogenesis in the vertebrate vascular system, and primary branching in the Drosophila tracheal system, specialized tip cells direct branch outgrowth and network formation. When tip cells lumenize, they form subcellular (seamless) tubes. How these seamless tubes are made, shaped and maintained remains poorly understood. Here we characterize a Drosophila mutant called ichor (ich), and show that ich is essential for the integrity and shape of seamless tubes in tracheal terminal cells. We find that Ich regulates seamless tubulogenesis via its role in promoting the formation of a mature apical extracellular matrix (aECM) lining the lumen of the seamless tubes. We determined that ich encodes a zinc finger protein (CG11966) that acts, as a transcriptional activator required for the expression of multiple aECM factors, including a novel membrane-anchored trypsin protease (CG8213). Thus, the integrity and shape of seamless tubes are regulated by the aECM that lines their lumens.",An Ichor-dependent apical extracellular matrix regulates seamless tube shape and integrity.

"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the features of immune-mediated non-celiac villous atrophies, such as autoimmune enteropathy (AIE). We investigated the demographic, clinical, and histologic features of adults with AIE compared to adults with refractory celiac disease type 1. We also report outcomes of treatment with open-label budesonide. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control of patients with AIE (n = 30) seen at the Mayo Clinic (in Rochester, Minnesota) from 2000 through 2015. Patients with refractory celiac disease type 1 who were treated with open-label budesonide served as controls (n = 42). Biopsy specimens were reviewed for all patients. We collected demographic, clinical, biochemical and histologic data from patients. We also collected data on responses to open-capsule budesonide from patients with AIE (available from 22 patients) and controls (available from 42 patients); the median duration of follow up was 28 months (range, 0-1421 months). RESULTS: Patients with AIE had a higher proportion of men (60%) and were younger (mean, 44 +/- 18 years) than patients with refractory celiac disease type 1 (29% men; P = .002 and mean age, 57 +/- 16 years; P = .007). A higher proportion of patients with AIE presented with chronic diarrhea (100%) and weight loss (90%) than patients with refractory celiac disease type 1 (71%; P < .001 and 71%; P = .05, respectively). Based on histologic analysis, there was no significant difference in degree of villous atrophy in intestinal tissues from patients with AIE vs controls (P = .68). However, a greater proportion of patients with RCD had increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (>40 per 100 epithelial cells in 100%) compared with patients with AIE (in 50%) (P = .003). Conventional therapy (systemic steroids) had failed in most patients with AIE (a complete clinical response was reported in only 7 patients) before treatment with open-capsule budesonide was initiated. A clinical response to open-capsule budesonide was reported for 85% of patients with AIE (50% complete response, 35% partial response) compared to 92% of controls (68% complete response, 24% partial response). CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective study of 30 patients with AIE, followed for a median 28 months, we found this disease to have has distinct demographic, clinical, and histologic characteristics compared to refractory celiac disease type 1. Most patients with AIE (85%) have a clinical response to budesonide, all of whom were unsuccessfully treated with conventional therapies.",Features of Adult Autoimmune Enteropathy Compared With Refractory Celiac Disease.
"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for neonates is applied routinely at major children's hospitals around the world. While the practice seems routine, the peculiar physiology of the small human imposes particular constraints on selection of equipment, performance of the circuit, and risks to the child. The physiology of small patients and physics of circuit elements leave many areas opaque and far from optimal, but still allow assembly of a set of useful heuristics for good practice. Here, we examine individual mechanical components of the ECMO circuit with attention to selection, pitfalls, and peculiarities of each when applied to the neonate.",Special equipment considerations for neonatal ECMO.

"Neuroblastomas are characterized by heterogeneous clinical behavior, from spontaneous regression or differentiation into a benign ganglioneuroma, to relentless progression despite aggressive, multimodality therapy. Indeed, neuroblastoma is unique among human cancers in terms of its propensity to undergo spontaneous regression. The strongest evidence for this comes from the mass screening studies conducted in Japan, North America and Europe and it is most evident in infants with stage 4S disease. This propensity is associated with a pattern of genomic change characterized by whole chromosome gains rather than segmental chromosome changes but the mechanism(s) underlying spontaneous regression are currently a matter of speculation. There is evidence to support several possible mechanisms of spontaneous regression in neuroblastomas: (1) neurotrophin deprivation, (2) loss of telomerase activity, (3) humoral or cellular immunity and (4) alterations in epigenetic regulation and possibly other mechanisms. It is likely that a better understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous regression will help to identify targeted therapeutic approaches for these tumors. The most easily targeted mechanism is the delayed activation of developmentally programmed cell death regulated by the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) pathway. Pan-Trk inhibitors are currently in clinical trials and so Trk inhibition might be used as the first line of therapy in infants with biologically favorable tumors that require treatment. Alternative approaches consist of breaking immune tolerance to tumor antigens but approaches to telomere shortening or epigenetic regulation are not easily druggable. The different mechanisms of spontaneous neuroblastoma regression are reviewed here, along with possible therapeutic approaches.",Spontaneous regression of neuroblastoma.
ABCA1 functions as a lipid transporter because it mediates the transfer of cellular phospholipid (PL) and free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) to apoA-I and related proteins present in the extracellular medium. ABCA1 is a membrane PL translocase and its enzymatic activity leads to transfer of PL molecules from the cytoplasmic leaflet to the exofacial leaflet of a cell plasma membrane (PM). The presence of active ABCA1 in the PM promotes binding of apoA-I to the cell surface. About 10% of this bound apoA-I interacts directly with ABCA1 and stabilizes the transporter. Most of the pool of cell surface-associated apoA-I is bound to lipid domains in the PM that are created by the activity of ABCA1. The amphipathic alpha-helices in apoA-I confer detergent-like properties on the protein enabling it to solubilize PL and FC in these membrane domains to create a heterogeneous population of discoidal nascent HDL particles. This review focuses on current understanding of the structure-function relationships of human ABCA1 and the molecular mechanisms underlying HDL particle production.,Is ABCA1 a lipid transfer protein?
"Improving our ability to construct and functionally characterize DNA sequences would broadly accelerate progress in biology. Here, we introduce DropSynth, a scalable, low-cost method to build thousands of defined gene-length constructs in a pooled (multiplexed) manner. DropSynth uses a library of barcoded beads that pull down the oligonucleotides necessary for a gene's assembly, which are then processed and assembled in water-in-oil emulsions. We used DropSynth to successfully build more than 7000 synthetic genes that encode phylogenetically diverse homologs of two essential genes in Escherichia coli We tested the ability of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase homologs to complement a knockout E. coli strain in multiplex, revealing core functional motifs and reasons underlying homolog incompatibility. DropSynth coupled with multiplexed functional assays allows us to rationally explore sequence-function relationships at an unprecedented scale.",Multiplexed gene synthesis in emulsions for exploring protein functional landscapes.
"BACKGROUND: Quick and successful vascular access in injured patients arriving in extremis is crucial to enable early resuscitation and rapid OR transport for definitive repair. We hypothesized that intraosseous (IO) access would be faster and have higher success rates than peripheral intravenous (PIV) or central venous catheters (CVCs). METHODS: High-definition video recordings of resuscitations for all patients undergoing emergency department thoracotomy from April 2016 to July 2017 were reviewed as part of a quality improvement initiative. Demographics, mechanism of injury, access type, access location, start and stop time, and success of each vascular access attempt were recorded. Times to completion for access types (PIV, IO, CVC) were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for multiple comparisons, while categorical outcomes, such as success rates by access type, were compared using chi test or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Study patients had a median age of 30 years (interquartile range [IQR], 25-38 years), 92% were male, 92% were African American, and 93% sustained penetrating trauma. A total of 145 access attempts in 38 patients occurred (median, 3.8; SD, 1.4 attempts per patient). There was no difference between duration of PIV and IO attempts (0.63; IQR, 0.35-0.96 vs. 0.39 IQR, 0.13-0.65 minutes, adjusted p = 0.03), but both PIV and IO were faster than CVC attempts (3.2; IQR, 1.72-5.23 minutes; adjusted p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Intraosseous lines had higher success rates than PIVs or CVCs (95% vs. 42% vs. 46%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Access attempts using IO are as fast as PIV attempts but are more than twice as likely to be successful. Attempts at CVC access in patients in extremis have high rates of failure and take a median of over 3 minutes. While IO access may not completely supplant PIVs and CVCs, IO access should be considered as a first-line therapy for trauma patients in extremis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, level III.",The intraosseous have it: A prospective observational study of vascular access success rates in patients in extremis using video review.
"Clinical assessment in psychiatry is commonly based on findings from brief, regularly scheduled in-person appointments. Although critically important, this approach reduces assessment to cross-sectional observations that miss essential information about disease course. The mental health provider makes all medical decisions based on this limited information. Thanks to recent technological advances such as mobile phones and other personal devices, electronic health (eHealth) data collection strategies now can provide access to real-time patient self-report data during the interval between visits. Since mobile phones are generally kept on at all times and carried everywhere, they are an ideal platform for the broad implementation of ecological momentary assessment technology. Integration of these tools into medical practice has heralded the eHealth era. Intelligent health (iHealth) further builds on and expands eHealth by adding novel built-in data analysis approaches based on (1) incorporation of new technologies into clinical practice to enhance real-time self-monitoring, (2) extension of assessment to the patient's environment including caregivers, and (3) data processing using data mining to support medical decision making and personalized medicine. This will shift mental health care from a reactive to a proactive and personalized discipline.",From eHealth to iHealth: Transition to Participatory and Personalized Medicine in Mental Health.
"Genetics play a significant role in venous thromboembolism (VTE), yet current clinical laboratory-based testing identifies a known heritable thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation G20210A, or a deficiency of protein C, protein S, or antithrombin) in only a minority of VTE patients. We hypothesized that a substantial number of VTE patients could have lesser-known thrombophilia mutations. To test this hypothesis, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 64 patients with VTE, focusing our analysis on a novel 55-gene extended thrombophilia panel that we compiled. Our extended thrombophilia panel identified a probable disease-causing genetic variant or variant of unknown significance in 39 of 64 study patients (60.9%), compared with 6 of 237 control patients without VTE (2.5%) (P < .0001). Clinical laboratory-based thrombophilia testing identified a heritable thrombophilia in only 14 of 54 study patients (25.9%). The majority of WES variants were either associated with thrombosis based on prior reports in the literature or predicted to affect protein structure based on protein modeling performed as part of this study. Variants were found in major thrombophilia genes, various SERPIN genes, and highly conserved areas of other genes with established or potential roles in coagulation or fibrinolysis. Ten patients (15.6%) had >1 variant. Sanger sequencing performed in family members of 4 study patients with and without VTE showed generally concordant results with thrombotic history. WES and extended thrombophilia testing are promising tools for improving our understanding of VTE pathogenesis and identifying inherited thrombophilias.",Whole-exome sequencing in evaluation of patients with venous thromboembolism.
"High-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) is crucial for the self-renewal of fetal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) but is downregulated in adult HSCs via repression by MIRlet-7 and the polycomb-recessive complex 2 (PRC2) including EZH2. The HMGA2 messenger RNA (mRNA) level is often elevated in patients with myelofibrosis that exhibits an advanced myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) subtype, and deletion of Ezh2 promotes the progression of severe myelofibrosis in JAK2(V617F) mice with upregulation of several oncogenes such as Hmga2. However, the direct role of HMGA2 in the pathogenesis of MPNs remains unknown. To clarify the impact of HMGA2 on MPNs carrying the driver mutation, we generated DeltaHmga2/JAK2(V617F) mice overexpressing Hmga2 due to deletion of the 3' untranslated region. Compared with JAK2(V617F) mice, DeltaHmga2/JAK2(V617F) mice exhibited more severe leukocytosis, anemia and splenomegaly, and shortened survival, whereas severity of myelofibrosis was comparable. DeltaHmga2/JAK2(V617F) cells showed a greater repopulating ability that reproduced the severe MPN compared with JAK2(V617F) cells in serial bone marrow transplants, indicating that Hmga2 promotes MPN progression at the HSC level. Hmga2 also enhanced apoptosis of JAK2(V617F) erythroblasts that may worsen anemia. Relative to JAK2(V617F) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), over 30% of genes upregulated in DeltaHmga2/JAK2(V617F) HSPCs overlapped with those derepressed by Ezh2 loss in JAK2(V617F)/Ezh2(Delta/Delta) HSPCs, suggesting that Hmga2 may facilitate upregulation of Ezh2 targets. Correspondingly, deletion of Hmga2 ameliorated anemia and splenomegaly in JAK2(V617F)/Ezh2(Delta/wild-type) mice, and MIRlet-7 suppression and PRC2 mutations correlated with the elevated HMGA2 mRNA levels in patients with MPNs, especially myelofibrosis. These findings suggest the crucial role of HMGA2 in MPN progression.",Hmga2 collaborates with JAK2V617F in the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms.
"Anti-protamine (PRT)/heparin antibodies are a newly described class of heparin-dependent antibodies occurring in patients exposed to PRT and heparin during cardiac surgery. To understand the biologic significance of anti-PRT/heparin antibodies, we developed a murine monoclonal antibody (ADA) specific for PRT/heparin complexes and compared it to patient-derived anti-PRT/heparin antibodies, as well as comparing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies with anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin. Using monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal patient-derived antibodies, we show distinctive binding patterns of anti-PRT/heparin antibodies as compared with PF4/heparin antibodies. Whereas heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody binding to PF4/heparin is inhibited by relatively low doses of heparin (0-1 U/mL), anti-PRT/heparin antibodies, including ADA, retain binding to PRT/heparin over a broad range of heparin concentrations (0-50 U/mL). Unlike PF4/heparin antibodies, which recognize PF4 complexed to purified or cell-associated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), anti-PRT/heparin antibodies show variable binding to cell-associated GAGs. Further, binding of anti-PRT/heparin antibodies to PRT/dextran complexes correlates closely with the ability of antibodies to bind to cell-surface PRT. These findings suggest that antibody binding to PRT/dextran may identify a subset of clinically relevant anti-PRT/heparin antibodies that can bind to cell-surface GAGs. Together, these findings show important serologic differences between HIT and anti-PRT/heparin antibodies, which may account for the variability in disease expression of the two classes of heparin-dependent antibodies.",Serologic characterization of anti-protamine/heparin and anti-PF4/heparin antibodies.
"Asymmetric cell division results in two distinctly fated daughter cells. A molecular hallmark of asymmetric division is the unequal partitioning of cell fate determinants. We have previously established that growth factor signaling promotes protein depalmitoylation to foster polarized protein localization, which, in turn, drives migration and metastasis. We report protein palmitoylation as a key mechanism for the asymmetric partitioning of the cell fate determinants Numb and beta-catenin through the activity of the depalmitoylating enzyme APT1. Using point mutations, we showed that specific palmitoylated residues on Numb were required for its asymmetric localization. By live-cell imaging, we showed that reciprocal interactions between APT1 and the Rho family GTPase CDC42 promoted the asymmetric localization of Numb and beta-catenin to the plasma membrane. This, in turn, restricted Notch- or Wnt-responsive transcriptional activity to one daughter cell. Moreover, we showed that altering APT1 abundance changed the transcriptional signatures of MDA-MB-231 triple receptor-negative breast cancer cells, similar to changes in Notch and beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling. We also showed that loss of APT1 depleted a specific subpopulation of tumorigenic cells in colony formation assays. Together, our findings suggest that APT1-mediated depalmitoylation is a major mechanism of asymmetric cell division that maintains Notch- and Wnt-associated protein dynamics, gene expression, and cellular functions.",The depalmitoylase APT1 directs the asymmetric partitioning of Notch and Wnt signaling during cell division.

"Whole-exome and targeted sequencing of 13 individuals from 10 unrelated families with overlapping clinical manifestations identified loss-of-function and missense variants in KIAA1109 allowing delineation of an autosomal-recessive multi-system syndrome, which we suggest to name Alkuraya-Kucinskas syndrome (MIM 617822). Shared phenotypic features representing the cardinal characteristics of this syndrome combine brain atrophy with clubfoot and arthrogryposis. Affected individuals present with cerebral parenchymal underdevelopment, ranging from major cerebral parenchymal thinning with lissencephalic aspect to moderate parenchymal rarefaction, severe to mild ventriculomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia with brainstem dysgenesis, and cardiac and ophthalmologic anomalies, such as microphthalmia and cataract. Severe loss-of-function cases were incompatible with life, whereas those individuals with milder missense variants presented with severe global developmental delay, syndactyly of 2(nd) and 3(rd) toes, and severe muscle hypotonia resulting in incapacity to stand without support. Consistent with a causative role for KIAA1109 loss-of-function/hypomorphic variants in this syndrome, knockdowns of the zebrafish orthologous gene resulted in embryos with hydrocephaly and abnormally curved notochords and overall body shape, whereas published knockouts of the fruit fly and mouse orthologous genes resulted in lethality or severe neurological defects reminiscent of the probands' features.",KIAA1109 Variants Are Associated with a Severe Disorder of Brain Development and Arthrogryposis.
"OBJECTIVE: Booster seats ensure appropriate belt fit for children that a traditional vehicle seat belt cannot offer to small occupants. In this study, the responses of the PIPER 6-year-old human body model are compared to the traditional Q6 anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD). METHODS: Eight frontal impact finite element simulations were run using 4 different child restraining systems on the FMVSS 213 test bench. Kinematics and kinetics were extracted and compared between the 2 child models. RESULTS: The PIPER 6-year-old showed variation by 11.2 +/- 14.1% (head resultant acceleration, G), 20.4 +/- 50.3% (chest resultant acceleration, G), 272.9 +/- 188.4% (chest displacement, mm), 24.8 +/- 17.5% (maximum head excursion, mm), -31.5 +/- 5.1% (neck force, Fz, N), -73.8 +/- 2.8% (neck moment, My, N.m), and -60.4 +/- 7.2% (Nij) compared to the Q6. However, the kinematics of both models were nearly similar. CONCLUSIONS: The PIPER model has a flexible neck and shows higher chest displacement compared to the Q6. We hypothesize that this is due to the inherent anatomical and mechanical differences between the human body model and the ATD model. More research is needed to explore these differences systematically.",Evaluating the response of the PIPER scalable human body model across child restraining seats in simulated frontal crashes.
"INTRODUCTION: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) represent clinically silent haemorrhagic events. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) portend negative neurovascular and cognitive outcomes in the general population and are associated with cognitive impairment in persons with haemophilia (PWH). Prevalence, patterns, and risk factors for CMBs in PWH have not been directly compared to persons without coagulopathy. AIM: To examine prevalence, patterns, and risk factors for CMBs in PWH vs normal controls. METHODS: Adults with haemophilia A or B and haemostatically normal controls were recruited. Subjects were excluded if taking an antithrombotic agent other than low-dose aspirin (<100 mg). All subjects underwent T2*MRI of the brain; scans were reviewed independently by two neuroradiologists blinded to subject group to determine the presence of CMBs. RESULTS: We recruited 31 PWH and 32 controls. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were more prevalent in PWH; smoking was more common among controls. Cardiovascular (CV) risk factors were similar between groups. Prevalence of CMBs was 35% in PWH and 25% in controls (P = .42). Among PWH, advanced age, history of HCV infection, and CV risk factors were associated with CMBs. Multiple and large (>5 mm) CMBs were seen only in PWH. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are common in adults with haemophilia, but not clearly more prevalent than in haemostatically normal controls. In PWH, older age, HCV infection, CV risk factors, and the presence of an inhibitor were associated with CMBs. Large CMBs and multiple CMBs may be more prevalent in PWH than in the general population. The clinical impact of CMBs in PWH requires further study.",Prevalence of and risk factors for cerebral microbleeds among adult patients with haemophilia A or B.

"OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of vaginal delivery after vaginal trial of labor (TOL) among women with triplet gestations. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of all women delivering a viable triplet gestation between 2005 and 2016. The primary outcome was rate of vaginal delivery among all women attempting vaginal delivery. Secondary outcomes included factors associated with undergoing triplet TOL, and maternal and neonatal complications by planned delivery approach. RESULTS: Of the 83 eligible women, 21 (25.3%) underwent TOL. A majority of these (57.1, 95% confidence interval 36.5-75.5%) achieved a vaginal delivery of all three triplets. Women who underwent TOL were more likely to be multiparous or to have spontaneous preterm labor. There were no differences in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes by planned delivery approach.

"OBJECTIVE: One barrier to timely access to outpatient pediatric subspecialty care is the complexity of scheduling processes. We evaluated the impact of implementing electronically transmitted referrals on subspecialty visit attendance. METHODS: Through collaboration with stakeholders, an electronically transmitted referral order system was designed, piloted, and implemented in 15 general pediatrics practices, with 24 additional practices serving as controls. We used statistical process control methods and difference-in-differences analysis to examine visits attended, appointments scheduled, appointment nonattendance, and referral volume. Electronically transmitted referrals then were expanded to all 39 practices. We surveyed referring pediatricians at all practices before and after implementation. RESULTS: From April 2015 through September 2016 there were 33,485 referral orders across all practices (7770 before the pilot, 11,776 during the pilot, 13,939 after full implementation). At pilot practices, there was a significant and sustained improvement in subspecialty visits attended within 4 weeks of referral (10.9% to 20.0%; P < .001). Relative to control practices, pilot practices experienced an 8.6% improvement (P = .001). After implementation at control practices, rates of visits attended also improved but to a smaller degree: 11.8% to 14.7% (P < .001). In survey responses, referring pediatricians noted improved scheduling processes but had continued concerns with appointment availability and referral tracking. CONCLUSIONS: While electronically transmitted referrals improved visit attendance after pediatric subspecialty referral, the sizable percentage of children without attended visits, the muted effect at control practices, and pediatrician survey responses indicate that additional work is needed to address barriers to pediatric subspecialty care.",Impact of Implementation of Electronically Transmitted Referrals on Pediatric Subspecialty Visit Attendance.
"The design of hospital environments is receiving increased attention as an important contributor to patient satisfaction and experience, which have a direct impact on reimbursement. Well-designed health care environments can decrease stress, improve concentration, and contribute to improved patient outcomes and enhanced staff morale.

"BACKGROUND: Surgical-site infections (SSIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in neurosurgical patients. Topical antibiotics are one potential method to reduce the incidence of these infections. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of topical vancomycin applied within the wound during craniotomy in a large prospective cohort study at a major academic center. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-five patients were studied prospectively in this cohort study; 205 patients received 1 g of topical vancomycin powder in the subgaleal space while 150 matched control patients did not. Patients otherwise received identical care. The primary outcome variable was SSI rate factored by cohort. Secondary analysis examined cost savings from vancomycin usage estimated from hospital costs associated with SSI in craniotomy patients. RESULTS: The addition of topical vancomycin was associated with a significantly lower rate of SSI than standard of care alone (0.49% [1/205] vs 6% [9/150], P = .002). Based on the costs of revision surgery for infections, topical vancomycin usage was estimated to save $1367 446 per 1000 craniotomy patients. No adverse reactions occurred. CONCLUSION: Topical vancomycin is a safe, effective, and cost-saving measure to prevent SSIs following craniotomy. These results have broad implications for standard of care in craniotomy.","Topical Vancomycin Reduces Surgical-Site Infections After Craniotomy: A Prospective, Controlled Study."
"Lung cancer remains one of the most prominent public health challenges, accounting for the highest incidence and mortality among all human cancers. While pulmonary invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (PIMA) is one of the most aggressive types of non-small cell lung cancer, transcriptional drivers of PIMA remain poorly understood. In the present study, we found that Forkhead box M1 transcription factor (FOXM1) is highly expressed in human PIMAs and associated with increased extracellular mucin deposition and the loss of NKX2.1. To examine consequences of FOXM1 expression in tumor cells in vivo, we employed an inducible, transgenic mouse model to express an activated FOXM1 transcript in urethane-induced benign lung adenomas. FOXM1 accelerated tumor growth, induced progression from benign adenomas to invasive, metastatic adenocarcinomas, and induced SOX2, a marker of poorly differentiated tumor cells. Adenocarcinomas in FOXM1 transgenic mice expressed increased MUC5B and MUC5AC, and reduced NKX2.1, which are characteristics of mucinous adenocarcinomas. Expression of FOXM1 in KrasG12D transgenic mice increased the mucinous phenotype in KrasG12D-driven lung tumors. Anterior Gradient 2 (AGR2), an oncogene critical for intracellular processing and packaging of mucins, was increased in mouse and human PIMAs and was associated with FOXM1. FOXM1 directly bound to and transcriptionally activated human AGR2 gene promoter via the -257/-247 bp region. Finally, using orthotopic xenografts we demonstrated that inhibition of either FOXM1 or AGR2 in human PIMAs inhibited mucinous characteristics, and reduced tumor growth and invasion.

We hypothesize that allograft and recipient survivals in offspring-to-parent living donor kidney transplantation differ between men and women due to donor-specific alloimmunization during pregnancy. We retrospectively analyzed long-term allograft and patient survival among men and women who received an offspring living donor kidney compared with those who received other haplotype-matched living donor kidneys. Based on multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling of Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data from 2001 to 2015, we found that both men and women who received offspring living donor kidneys had significantly increased mortality compared with recipients who received nonoffspring living donor kidneys. While male recipients of any living donor kidney had greater risk of mortality and allograft failure than female recipients, there was no significant difference in all-cause allograft failure or mortality in male versus female recipients of offspring living donor kidney transplantations. Our analysis demonstrated no significant interaction between recipient sex and donor offspring status. We conclude that nonoffspring living donors should be considered whenever feasible for both men and women with multiple donor options.",Inferior long-term allograft and patient outcomes among recipients of offspring living donor kidneys.
"Significant concerns have been raised owing to the rapid global spread of infection and disease caused by the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV). Recent studies suggest that ZIKV can also be transmitted sexually, further increasing the exposure risk for this virus. Associated with this spread is a dramatic increase in cases of microcephaly and additional congenital abnormalities in infants of ZIKV-infected mothers, as well as a rise in the occurrence of Guillain Barre' syndrome in infected adults. Importantly, there are no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection. In this study, we generate and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel, synthetic, DNA vaccine targeting the pre-membrane+envelope proteins (prME) of ZIKV. Following initial in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct, mice and non-human primates were immunised with this prME DNA-based immunogen through electroporation-mediated enhanced DNA delivery. Vaccinated animals were found to generate antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and neutralisation activity. In mice lacking receptors for interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta (designated IFNAR(-/-)) immunisation with this DNA vaccine induced, following in vivo viral challenge, 100% protection against infection-associated weight loss or death in addition to preventing viral pathology in brain tissue. In addition, passive transfer of non-human primate anti-ZIKV immune serum protected IFNAR(-/-) mice against subsequent viral challenge. This study in NHP and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prME in ZIKV infection and suggests that additional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for ZIKV control and disease prevention in humans.",In vivo protection against ZIKV infection and pathogenesis through passive antibody transfer and active immunisation with a prMEnv DNA vaccine.
"Purpose: Spine surgeons have increasingly used intraoperative application of topical vancomycin powder (TVP) to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). The goals of this study were to define the rate of pharmacological adverse reaction to TVP in young patients undergoing posterior spinal surgery and to summarise institutional variation in TVP dosing. Methods: This retrospective observational study included ten spine centres in the United States and one in Europe. Patients with early onset scoliosis who underwent posterior spine surgery were eligible for inclusion. Age, weight, TVP dose and surgery type were recorded. Surgeries where patient age was > 12 years were excluded. Pharmacological adverse reactions were defined as clinical instances of Red Man Syndrome, rash, nephrotoxicity, proteinuria, hepatotoxicity or ototoxicity. The rate of pharmacological adverse reaction to TVP was calculated. Dosing practices were summarised. Results: Patient age was in the range of seven months to 12 years (median ten years). Of 1398 observations, there was one possible pharmacological adverse reaction. This was in a ten-year-old, 20.4-kg female patient with neuromuscular sco-liosis undergoing growing rod implantation. She was dosed with 1500 mg of TVP and immediately developed a transient rash without systemic symptoms. This abated over minutes without any medical intervention. There were no other adverse reactions in the sample. The population rate of pharmacological adverse reaction was 0.072% (95% confidence interval 0 to 0.4). Significant variability in dosing practices existed between centres. Conclusion: Pharmacological adverse reactions to TVP are rare. Future work may establish evidence-based guidelines for TVP dosing based on patient weight and other variables.",Clinically apparent adverse reactions to intra-wound vancomycin powder in early onset scoliosis are rare.
"The day-to-day rigors of medical education often preclude learners from gaining a longitudinal perspective on who they are becoming. Furthermore, the current focus on competencies, coupled with concerning rates of trainee burnout and a decline in empathy, have fueled the search for pedagogic tools to foster students' reflective capacity. In response, many scholars have looked to the tradition of narrative medicine to foster ""reflective spaces"" wherein holistic professional identity construction can be supported. This article focuses on the rationale, content, and early analysis of the reflective space created by the narrative medicine-centered portfolio at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. In January 2015, the authors investigated learning outcomes derived from students' ""Signature Reflections,"" end-of-semester meta-reflections on their previous portfolio work. The authors analyzed the Signature Reflections of 97 (of 132) first-year medical students using a constant comparative process. This iterative approach allowed researchers to identify themes within students' writings and interpret the data. The authors identified two overarching interpretive themes-recognition and grappling-and six subthemes. Recognition included comments about self-awareness and empathy. Grappling encompassed the subthemes of internal change, dichotomies, wonder and questioning, and anxiety. Based on the authors' analyses, the Signature Reflection seems to provide a structured framework that encourages students' reflective capacity and the construction of holistic professional identity. Other medical educators may adopt meta-reflection, within the reflective space of a writing portfolio, to encourage students' acquisition of a longitudinal perspective on who they are becoming and how they are constructing their professional identity.",Looking Back to Move Forward: First-Year Medical Students' Meta-Reflections on Their Narrative Portfolio Writings.
"Objective: Evaluate the effects of an online commercial weight management program, with and without provision of a 'smart' scale with instructions to weigh daily and weekly tailored feedback, on weight loss and the frequency of body-weight self-monitoring. Methods: Participants (N = 92; body mass index 27-40 kg/m(2)) were randomized to 6 months of no-cost access to the Weight Watchers Online (WWO) platform alone, or enhanced with a cellular-connected 'smart' scale, instructions to weigh daily and weekly pre-scripted email feedback (Weight Watchers Online Enhanced [WWO-E]). The number of days that weight was self-monitored (via 'smart' scale in WWO-E and manually in WWO) was recorded automatically across the 6-month trial. Objective weight was measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Results: While both groups achieved statistically significant weight loss, mean +/- standard error weight loss did not differ between WWO-E and WWO at 3 months (5.1 +/- 0.6 kg vs. 4.0 +/- 0.7 kg, respectively; p = 0.257) or 6 months (5.3 +/- 0.6 kg vs. 3.9 +/- 0.7 kg, respectively; p = 0.116). However, a greater proportion of WWO-E lost >/=5% of initial body weight at 3 months (52.2% vs. 28.3%; p = 0.033), but not 6 months (43.5% vs. 30.4%; p = 0.280), compared with WWO. Mean +/- standard deviation days with self-monitored weight was higher in WWO-E (80.5 +/- 5.6; 44.7% of days) than WWO (12.0 +/- 1.0; 6.7% of days; p < 0.001) across the 6-month study period. Conclusions: This is the first study to show that provision of a 'smart' scale with weekly tailored feedback substantially increased the frequency of self-weighing and the proportion of participants achieving an initial clinically significant >/=5% weight loss (52% vs. 28%) in an online commercial weight management program. Both WWO and WWO-E produced significant weight loss over 6 months. While mean weight losses were slightly greater in the enhanced group, the difference was not statistically significant in this small sample. This study provides support for the clinical utility of online commercial weight management programs and the potential for supporting technology such as 'smart' scales to improve adherence to body-weight self-monitoring and clinical outcomes.",Weight loss and frequency of body-weight self-monitoring in an online commercial weight management program with and without a cellular-connected 'smart' scale: a randomized pilot study.
"Type I males of the Pacific midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) vibrate their swimbladder to generate mating calls, or ""hums,"" that attract females to their nests. In contrast to the intermittent calls produced by male Atlantic toadfish (Opsanus tau), which occur with a duty cycle (calling time divided by total time) of only 3-8%, midshipman can call continuously for up to an hour. With 100% duty cycles and frequencies of 50-100 Hz (15 degrees C), the superfast muscle fibers that surround the midshipman swimbladder may contract and relax as many as 360,000 times in 1 h. The energy for this activity is supported by a large volume of densely packed mitochondria that are found in the peripheral and central regions of the fiber. The remaining fiber cross section contains contractile filaments and a well-developed network of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and triadic junctions. Here, to understand quantitatively how Ca(2+) is managed by midshipman fibers during calling, we measure (a) the Ca(2+) pumping-versus-pCa and force-versus-pCa relations in skinned fiber bundles and (b) changes in myoplasmic free [Ca(2+)] (Delta[Ca(2+)]) during stimulated activity of individual fibers microinjected with the Ca(2+) indicators Mag-fluo-4 and Fluo-4. As in toadfish, the force-pCa relation in midshipman is strongly right-shifted relative to the Ca(2+) pumping-pCa relation, and contractile activity is controlled in a synchronous, not asynchronous, fashion during electrical stimulation. SR Ca(2+) release per action potential is, however, approximately eightfold smaller in midshipman than in toadfish. Midshipman fibers have a larger time-averaged free [Ca(2+)] during activity than toadfish fibers, which permits faster Ca(2+) pumping because the Ca(2+) pumps work closer to their maximum rate. Even with midshipman's sustained release and pumping of Ca(2+), however, the Ca(2+) energy cost of calling (per kilogram wet weight) is less than twofold more in midshipman than in toadfish.",Small Ca(2+) releases enable hour-long high-frequency contractions in midshipman swimbladder muscle.
"One of the crucial functions of the lymphatic system is maintenance of fluid balance. Nonetheless, due to lack of clinical imaging and interventional techniques, the lymphatic system has been under the radar of the medical community. The recently developed intranodal lymphangiography and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography provide new insight into lymphatic pathology. Thoracic duct embolization has become the method of choice for the treatment of patients with chylous leaks. Interstitial lymphatic embolization further expanded the lymphatic embolization approaches. Liver lymphatic lymphangiography and embolization allow treatment of postsurgical liver lymphorrhea and protein-losing enteropathy. The potential for further growth of lymphatic interventions is vast and includes liver lymphatic procedures and advanced thoracic duct interventions, such as thoracic duct externalization and stenting. These current and future advances will open up a realm of new treatments and diagnostic opportunities.",Modern Techniques of Lymphangiography and Interventions: Current Status and Future Development.

"The scientific evidence to support the value of a range of non-pharmacological interventions for people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasing. However, showing unequivocally that specific interventions are better than usual care is not straightforward because of generic drawbacks of clinical trials. Here, we address these challenges, specifically related to the context of evaluating complex non-pharmacological interventions for people with PD. Moreover, we discuss the potential merits of undertaking ""real world"" analyses using medical claims data. We illustrate this approach by discussing an interesting recent publication in The Lancet Neurology, which used such an approach to demonstrate the value of specialized physiotherapy for PD patients, over and above usual care physiotherapy.",Using Medical Claims Analyses to Understand Interventions for Parkinson Patients.
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recurrent hospital admissions for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are costly and contribute to a low quality of life for patients. We implemented a clinical pathway to safely discharge SCD patients with fever who are evaluated in the emergency department (ED) of a large tertiary care center. METHODS: An interdisciplinary team of ED and hematology physicians, nurses, and an improvement advisor developed a clinical pathway that identified febrile SCD patients at low risk of serious bacterial infection based on historical, clinical, and laboratory criteria who could be discharged from the ED. Phone follow-up was planned through the use of an automated electronic notification that was sent to an established hematology follow-up pool at the time of ED discharge. We conducted two ""fake front end"" trials in the ED to receive feedback on our process before full implementation. A postpathway implementation quality improvement team monitored discharge rates, phone follow-up rates and adverse events. RESULTS: In the first 9 weeks postpathway implementation, 100 SCD patients were evaluated for fever; 84 (24%) met low-risk criteria and were discharged home. This reduction in admission rate has been maintained throughout the 3 years postimplementation. Successful phone follow-up was achieved in all discharged patients within 24 hours and no adverse events were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Low-risk febrile patients with SCD can be safely discharged from the ED. An automated notification system within the electronic medical record system can facilitate patient follow-up after ED discharge. Future quality improvement efforts aimed to further reduce admissions in this population should target patients with modifiable risk factors for serious bacterial infection.",A Standardized Clinical Pathway to Decrease Hospital Admissions Among Febrile Children With Sickle Cell Disease.

"With the advent of international precision medicine initiatives, it is important to evaluate existing large-scale studies to inform future investigation. This study sought to review, describe, and evaluate all large-scale cardiovascular disease (CVD) studies completed in China. We undertook a review of all large-scale CVD studies completed in China to describe and evaluate their design, implementation, and dissemination in published medical reports. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. There were substantial variations in study design, geographic location, and data collection. Most studies lacked standard study names, did not publish their methods, and provided no publicly available data. Few studies included underdeveloped regions or minority groups. Most published articles contained only descriptions of the average population at risk of CVD, and no study predicted individual CVD risk or identified people at high risk. Future CVD studies in China may need to incorporate stronger systematic data collection methods, increased data transparency, clearer documentation, and standard study names to most gain from China's burgeoning field of CVD research.","Large-Scale Epidemiologic Studies of Cardiovascular Diseases in China: Need for Improved Data Collection, Methods, Transparency, and Documentation."
"With the transformation of HIV infection from an acutely life-threatening disease into a chronic condition (as a consequence of the development of effective antiretroviral medication), the perceived clinical importance of diagnosing and treating microsporidian infections diminished, at least in industrialized countries. In locales where effective antiretroviral therapy is not available, as well as in patients with immunodeficiency for reasons other than HIV infection (e.g., following organ transplantation), and in individuals with suspected ocular microsporidiosis, diagnosing microsporidian infections remains a clinical priority.

"beta- and gamma-cytoplasmic actin are nearly indistinguishable in their amino acid sequence, but are encoded by different genes that play non-redundant biological roles. The key determinants that drive their functional distinction are unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that beta- and gamma-actin functions are defined by their nucleotide, rather than their amino acid sequence, using targeted editing of the mouse genome. Although previous studies have shown that disruption of beta-actin gene critically impacts cell migration and mouse embryogenesis, we demonstrate here that generation of a mouse lacking beta-actin protein by editing beta-actin gene to encode gamma-actin protein, and vice versa, does not affect cell migration and/or organism survival. Our data suggest that the essential in vivo function of beta-actin is provided by the gene sequence independent of the encoded protein isoform. We propose that this regulation constitutes a global 'silent code' mechanism that controls the functional diversity of protein isoforms.","Diverse functions of homologous actin isoforms are defined by their nucleotide, rather than their amino acid sequence."
"BACKGROUND: Current studies that analyze the usefulness of amino acid and FDG-PET in distinguishing brain metastasis recurrence and radionecrosis after radiation therapy are limited by small cohort size. PURPOSE: Our aim was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of amino acid and FDG-PET in differentiating brain metastasis recurrence from radionecrosis after radiation therapy. DATA SOURCES: Studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. STUDY SELECTION: Fifteen studies were included from the literature. Each study used PET to differentiate radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in contrast-enhancing lesions on follow-up brain MR imaging after treating brain metastasis with radiation therapy. DATA ANALYSIS: Data were analyzed with a bivariate random-effects model. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio were pooled, and a summary receiver operating characteristic curve was fit to the data. DATA SYNTHESIS: The overall pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of PET were 0.85, 0.88, 7.0, 0.17, and 40, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.93. On subgroup analysis of different tracers, amino acid and FDG-PET had similar diagnostic accuracy. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the method of quantification based on patient, lesion, or PET scan (based on lesion versus not, P = .07) contributed to the heterogeneity. LIMITATIONS: Our study was limited by small sample size, and 60% of the included studies were of retrospective design.

"Graduate medical education (GME) in the United States is financed by contributions from both federal and state entities that total over $15 billion annually. Within institutions, these funds are distributed with limited transparency to achieve ill-defined outcomes. To address this, the Institute of Medicine convened a committee on the governance and financing of GME to recommend finance reform that would promote a physician training system that meets society's current and future needs. The resulting report provided several recommendations regarding the oversight and mechanisms of GME funding, including implementation of performance-based GME payments, but did not provide specific details about the content and development of metrics for these payments. To initiate a national conversation about performance-based GME funding, the authors asked: What should GME be held accountable for in exchange for public funding? In answer to this question, the authors propose 17 potential performance-based metrics for GME funding that could inform future funding decisions. Eight of the metrics are described as exemplars to add context and to help readers obtain a deeper understanding of the inherent complexities of performance-based GME funding. The authors also describe considerations and precautions for metric implementation.",Proposed Performance-Based Metrics for the Future Funding of Graduate Medical Education: Starting the Conversation.

"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether trauma exposure moderates the genetic correlation between substance use disorders and psychiatric disorders, we tested whether trauma exposure modifies the association of genetic risks for mental disorders with alcohol misuse and nicotine dependence (ND) symptoms. METHODS: High-resolution polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were calculated for 10 732 US Army soldiers (8346 trauma-exposed and 2386 trauma-unexposed) based on genome-wide association studies of bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. RESULTS: The main finding was a significant BD PRS-by-trauma interaction with respect to alcohol misuse (P = 6.07 x 10(-3) ). We observed a positive correlation between BD PRS and alcohol misuse in trauma-exposed soldiers (r = 0.029, P = 7.5 x 10(-3) ) and a negative correlation in trauma-unexposed soldiers (r = -0.071, P = 5.61 x 10(-4) ). Consistent (nominally significant) result with concordant effect, directions were observed in the schizophrenia PRS-by-trauma interaction analysis. The variants included in the BD PRS-by-trauma interaction showed significant enrichments for gene ontologies related to high voltage-gated calcium channel activity (GO:0008331, P = 1.51 x 10(-5) ; GO:1990454, P = 4.49 x 10(-6) ; GO:0030315, P = 2.07 x 10(-6) ) and for Beta1/Beta2 adrenergic receptor signaling pathways (P = 2.61 x 10(-4) ). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the genetic overlap between alcohol misuse and BD is significantly moderated by trauma exposure.

"PURPOSE: The majority of type 2 endoleaks (T2EL) are identified on computed tomography angiography (CTA) both on arterial and venous phase. There is a subset of T2EL that are demonstrated only on venous phase CTA. This study was done to report the outcomes of T2EL detected only on venous phase CTA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 261 consecutive T2EL treated via embolization were reviewed for the presence of endoleak demonstrated only on venous phase CTA. A group of 16 patients (12 men, 4 women; mean age, 80.1 years) was identified who had pre-embolization venous phase T2EL. Patients were evaluated for presence of T2EL after embolization, change in aneurysm diameter, and need for further intervention. RESULTS: The prevalence of venous phase T2EL was 6.1% (16/261; 95%CI: 3.2%-9.0%). On post-embolization CTA, the rate of successful embolization at 6 months was 2/12 (17%; 95%CI: 0%-38%). At 6-month follow-up, mean change in aneurysm diameter was +2.3mm (n=12; 95%CI: -0.5mm to +5.0mm). In total, 4/16 (25%; 95%CI: 4%-46%) underwent re-embolization and 4/16 (25%, 95%CI: 4%-46%) underwent conversion to open repair. There was one aneurysm rupture, which was successfully treated surgically. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that venous phase T2EL are not as responsive to embolization as standard T2EL and emphasize the need to follow patients with venous phase T2EL closely.",Outcomes of type 2 endoleaks detected on venous phase CT arteriography.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lung transplantation offers an effective treatment modality for patients with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The exact determination of when to refer, list, and offer transplant as well as the preferred transplant procedure type remains unclear. Additionally, there are special considerations specific to patients with COPD being considered for lung transplantation, including the implications of single lung transplantation on lung cancer risk, native lung hyperinflation, and overall survival. RECENT FINDINGS: The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation's most recent recommendations rely on an assessment of COPD severity based on BODE index. Despite the lack of evidence supporting a mortality benefit of bilateral over single lung transplantation for COPD patients, the majority of transplants performed in this population remain bilateral. Some of the concerns specific to single lung transplantation remain the possibility of de novo native lung cancer and the hemodynamic and physiologic implications of acute native lung hyperinflation. SUMMARY: COPD remains the most common worldwide indication for lung transplantation. Ongoing study is still required to assess the overall survival benefit of lung transplantation and assess the overall quality of life impact on the COPD patient population.","Lung transplantation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: past, present, and future directions."
"In the mature adult skeleton, new bone formation is normally restricted to regeneration of osseous tissue at sites of fracture. However, heterotopic ossification, or the formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, can occur within muscle, adipose, or fibrous connective tissue. Periarticular non-hereditary heterotopic ossification (NHHO) may occur after musculoskeletal trauma, following CNS injury, with certain arthropathies, or following injury or surgery that is often sustained in the context of age-related pathology. The histological mechanism of bone development in these forms of heterotopic ossification has thus far been uncharacterized. We performed a histological analysis of 90 bone specimens from 18 patients with NHHO secondary to defined precipitating conditions, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular accident, trauma without neurologic injury, and total hip or knee arthroplasty. All bone specimens revealed normal endochondral osteogenesis at heterotopic sites. We defined the order of sequence progression in NHHO lesion formation as occurring through six distinct histological stages: (1) perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, (2) lymphocytic migration into soft tissue, (3) reactive fibroproliferation, (4) neovascularity, (5) cartilage formation, and (6) endochondral bone formation. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of the predominant histopathological findings associated with multiple forms of NHHO and shows that they share a common mechanism of lesion formation.",Histopathology of periarticular non-hereditary heterotopic ossification.

"BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia affect billions of people worldwide. Infants and young children are the most vulnerable. The Ninos Primeros en Salud pediatric clinic aims to follow the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendation to screen all children at 12 months of age, a vital period for development and the time of greatest risk. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinic's performance screening for, diagnosing, and treating iron deficiency anemia; and to describe the prevalence and severity of anemia in infants and children attending a perirural clinic in the Dominican Republic. METHODS: A total of 293 charts were reviewed for hemoglobin tests performed between 9 and 15 months of age. If a hemoglobin screening was performed, then sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, and laboratory data were collected. If blood tests revealed anemia, then the presence or absence of documented anemia diagnosis as well as the presence or absence of documented provision of iron therapy were recorded. FINDINGS: Less than one-third (87, 29.7%) of patients had a documented hemoglobin test performed in this age range. Of these, 89.6% indicated anemia and nearly half (48.6%) revealed moderate anemia. One-third (34%) of hemoglobin results revealing anemia were not accompanied by a documented diagnosis. The vast majority (86.5%) of results indicated microcytosis, yet just more than half (50.8%) of anemic patients received iron therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Many children at the clinic were not screened for iron deficiency anemia during the period of highest risk. In the participants screened, iron deficiency anemia was underdiagnosed and often untreated. Anemia is a significant burden in this community-one demanding reliable screening and universal supplementation.",Evaluation of Iron Deficiency Anemia in a Pediatric Clinic in the Dominican Republic.
"BACKGROUND: Single-site laparoscopy is increasingly popular for straightforward operations like appendectomy. Due to limited triangulation and maneuverability, single-site cholecystectomy is riskier and more difficult. Robotics offer to make it easier and safer. METHODS: Twenty children and adolescents underwent robotic-assisted single-site cholecystectomy at a large academic children's hospital. Patients were not randomized; patients were offered the option of robotic-assisted single-site (SSR) or standard four-incision laparoscopic (LAP) cholecystectomy. Demographics and perioperative details were compared with those of a comparable cohort who underwent LAP during the same period. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in physical characteristics and indications for operation. The robotic operations took longer but both groups received similar PRN doses of parenteral opiates. Patients in the SSR group were all discharged on the first postoperative day. There were no major complications in either group but a slightly higher incidence of minor wound complications in the SSR group. CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted single-site cholecystectomy appears to be a safe alternative to standard laparoscopy with a similar postoperative pain profile, short postoperative lengths of stay, and, for some, a superior cosmetic result. Nevertheless, it comes with longer set-up and operative times, a higher incidence of minor wound complications, an unknown but possibly higher risk of incisional hernia, and higher costs.",Single-site robotic-assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy in children and adolescents: a report of 20 cases.
"The dendritic tree is a key determinant of neuronal information processing. In the motor system, the dendritic tree of spinal cord neurons undergoes dramatic remodeling in an activity-dependent manner during early postnatal life. This leads to the proper segmental spinal cord connectivity that subserves normal locomotor behavior. One molecular system driving the establishment of dendrite architecture of mammalian motor neurons relies on AMPA receptors (AMPA-Rs) assembled with the GluA1 subunit, and this occurs in an NMDA receptor (NMDA-R)-independent manner. The dendrite growth promoting activity of GluA1-containing AMPA-Rs depends on its intracellular binding partner, SAP97, and SAP97's PDZ3 domain. We show here that cysteine-rich interactor of PDZ3 (CRIPT) is a bona fide SAP97 PDZ3-domain binding partner, localizes to synapses with GluA1 and SAP97 along the dendritic tree, and is a determinant of the dendritic growth of mammalian spinal cord neurons. We further show that CRIPT has a well-conserved ortholog in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, and animals lacking CRIPT display decreased dendrite branching of the well-studied PVD neuron in vivo. The lack of CRIPT leads to a selective defect in touch perception, and this is rescued by expression of wild-type (WT) human CRIPT (hCRIPT) in the nervous system. This work brings new light into the molecular machinery that drives dendritic growth during development and may prove relevant to the promotion of nervous system plasticity following insult.",SAP97 Binding Partner CRIPT Promotes Dendrite Growth In Vitro and In Vivo.
"We studied whether ambient air pollution is associated with interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) and high attenuation areas (HAAs), which are qualitative and quantitative measurements of subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD) on computed tomography (CT).We performed analyses of community-based dwellers enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study. We used cohort-specific spatio-temporal models to estimate ambient pollution (fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3)) at each home. A total of 5495 participants underwent serial assessment of HAAs by cardiac CT; 2671 participants were assessed for ILAs using full lung CT at the 10-year follow-up. We used multivariable logistic regression and linear mixed models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, tobacco use, scanner technology and study site.The odds of ILAs increased 1.77-fold per 40 ppb increment in NOx (95% CI 1.06 to 2.95, p = 0.03). There was an overall trend towards an association between higher exposure to NOx and greater progression of HAAs (0.45% annual increase in HAAs per 40 ppb increment in NOx; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.92, p = 0.06). Associations of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), NOx and NO2 concentrations with progression of HAAs varied by race/ethnicity (p = 0.002, 0.007, 0.04, respectively, for interaction) and were strongest among non-Hispanic white people.We conclude that ambient air pollution exposures were associated with subclinical ILD.",Air pollution and subclinical interstitial lung disease: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) air-lung study.
"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic and histologic healing are emerging as new therapeutic goals in ulcerative colitis (UC), as these endpoints are associated with less relapse, hospitalization and colectomy. AIM: To investigate the association of serum infliximab trough concentrations during maintenance therapy with endoscopic or histologic healing in UC. METHODS: In this multi-center retrospective cohort study, we included consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe UC on infliximab maintenance therapy who had an endoscopic evaluation and underwent therapeutic drug monitoring within three months of the colonoscopy, between February 2008 and March 2016. Per event analysis was performed. Endoscopic healing was defined as Mayo endoscopic sub-score of </=1. Histologic healing was defined as no or only focal mild active inflammation. RESULTS: Seventy colonoscopies from 56 patients were evaluated. Infliximab trough concentrations (median [interquartile range]) were significantly higher in patients with endoscopic (11.3 [7.6-14.5] vs 6.3 [0-9.8] mug/mL, P < .001) or histologic (11.1 [6.7-14.5] vs 6.7 [0-9.9] mug/mL, P = .002) healing, respectively, compared to patients without healing. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses identified infliximab trough concentration thresholds of 7.5 (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.758) and 10.5 (AUC: 0.721) mug/mL to be associated with endoscopic and histologic healing, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified infliximab trough concentration >/=7.5 (P = .013; odds ratio [OR]: 4.3; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.4-13.3) and >/=10.5 mug/mL (P = .013; OR: 3.8; 95% CI: 1.3-11) as independent factors associated with endoscopic and histologic healing, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that infliximab trough concentrations during maintenance therapy are associated with endoscopic and histologic healing in patients with UC.",Infliximab trough concentrations during maintenance therapy are associated with endoscopic and histologic healing in ulcerative colitis.
"Mesothelioma is an incurable cancer for which effective therapies are required. Aberrant MET expression is prevalent in mesothelioma, although targeting using small molecule-based therapeutics has proven disappointing. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) couple the HLA-independent binding of a cell surface target to the delivery of a tailored T-cell activating signal. Here, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of MET re-targeted CAR T-cells against mesothelioma. Using immunohistochemistry, MET was detected in 67% of malignant pleural mesotheliomas, most frequently of epithelioid or biphasic subtype. The presence of MET did not influence patient survival. Candidate MET-specific CARs were engineered in which a CD28+CD3zeta endodomain was fused to one of 3 peptides derived from the N and K1 domains of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which represents the minimum MET binding element present in this growth factor. Using an NIH3T3-based artificial antigen-presenting cell system, we found that all 3 candidate CARs demonstrated high specificity for MET. By contrast, these CARs did not mediate T-cell activation upon engagement of other HGF binding partners, namely CD44v6 or heparan sulfate proteoglycans, including Syndecan-1. NK1-targeted CARs demonstrated broadly similar in vitro potency, indicated by destruction of MET-expressing mesothelioma cell lines, accompanied by cytokine release. In vivo anti-tumor activity was demonstrated following intraperitoneal delivery to mice with an established mesothelioma xenograft. Progressive tumor regression occurred without weight loss or other clinical indicators of toxicity. These data confirm the frequent expression of MET in malignant pleural mesothelioma and demonstrate that this can be targeted effectively and safely using a CAR T-cell immunotherapeutic strategy.",CAR T-cell immunotherapy of MET-expressing malignant mesothelioma.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Provide a practical update on drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) for anesthesia providers, which can also serve as a reference for those preparing to establish a DISE program. RECENT FINDINGS: New developments in surgical approaches to OSA and the growing global incidence of the condition have stimulated increased interest and demand for drug-induced sleep endoscopy. New techniques include transoral robotic surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulation. Recent DISE literature has sought to address numerous debates including relevance of DISE findings to those during physiologic sleep and the most appropriate depth and type of sedation for DISE. Propofol and dexmedetomidine have supplanted midazolam as the drugs of choice for DISE. Techniques based on pharmacokinetic models of propofol are superior to empiric dosing with regard to risk of respiratory compromise and the reliability of dexmedetomidine to achieve adequate conditions for a complete DISE exam is questionable. SUMMARY: The role of DISE in surgical evaluation and planning for treatment of OSA continues to develop. Numerous questions as to the optimal anesthetic approach remain unanswered. Multicenter studies that employ a standardized approach using EEG assessment, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, and objectively defined clinical endpoints will be helpful. There may be benefit to undertaking DISE studies in non-OSA patients.",Drug-induced sleep endoscopy: from obscure technique to diagnostic tool for assessment of obstructive sleep apnea for surgical interventions.

"INTRODUCTION: Child occupant safety in motor-vehicle crashes is evaluated using Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATD) seated in optimal positions. However, child occupants often assume suboptimal positions during real-world driving trips. Head impact to the seat back has been identified as one important injury causation scenario for seat belt restrained, head-injured children (Bohman et al., 2011). There is therefore a need to understand the interaction of children with the Child Restraint System to optimize protection. METHOD: Naturalistic driving studies (NDS) will improve understanding of out-of-position (OOP) trends. To quantify OOP positions, an NDS was conducted. Families used a study vehicle for two weeks during their everyday driving trips. The positions of rear-seated child occupants, representing 22 families, were evaluated. The study vehicle - instrumented with data acquisition systems, including Microsoft Kinect V1 - recorded rear seat occupants in 1120 driving 26 trips. Three novel analytical methods were used to analyze data. To assess skeletal tracking accuracy, analysts recorded occurrences where Kinect exhibited invalid head recognition among a randomly-selected subset (81 trips). Errors included incorrect target detection (e.g., vehicle headrest) or environmental interference (e.g., sunlight). When head data was present, Kinect was correct 41% of the time; two other algorithms - filtering for extreme motion, and background subtraction/head-based depth detection are described in this paper and preliminary results are presented. Accuracy estimates were not possible because of their experimental nature and the difficulty to use a ground truth for this large database. This NDS tested methods to quantify the frequency and magnitude of head positions for rear-seated child occupants utilizing Kinect motion-tracking. RESULTS: This study's results informed recent ATD sled tests that replicated observed positions (most common and most extreme), and assessed the validity of child occupant protection on these typical CRS uses. SUMMARY: Optimal protection in vehicles requires an understanding of how child occupants use the rear seat space. This study explored the feasibility of using Kinect to log positions of rear seated child occupants. Initial analysis used the Kinect system's skeleton recognition and two novel analytical algorithms to log head location. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This research will lead to further analysis leveraging Kinect raw data - and other NDS data - to quantify the frequency/magnitude of OOP situations, ATD sled tests that replicate observed positions, and advances in the design and testing of child occupant protection technology.",Automated recognition of rear seat occupants' head position using Kinect 3D point cloud.
"PURPOSE: Obesity is associated with both obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation. Differences in adipose tissue distribution are thought to underlie the development of both OSA and hypoventilation. We explored the relationships between the distribution of upper airway, neck, chest, abdominal and muscle fat in very obese individuals. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of individuals presenting to a tertiary sleep clinic or for assessment for bariatric surgery. Individuals underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of their upper airway, neck, chest, abdomen and thighs; respiratory polygraphy; 1 week of autotitrating CPAP; and morning arterial blood gas to determine carbon dioxide partial pressure and base excess. RESULTS: Fifty-three individuals were included, with mean age of 51.6 +/- 8.4 years and mean BMI of 44.3 +/- 7.9 kg/m(2); there were 27 males (51%). Soft palate, tongue and lateral wall volumes were significantly associated with the AHI in univariable analyses (p < 0.001). Gender was a significant confounder in these associations. No significant associations were found between MRI measures of adiposity and hypoventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In very obese individuals, our results indicate that increased volumes of upper airway structures are associated with increased severity of OSA, as previously reported in less obese individuals. Increasingly large upper airway structures that reduce pharyngeal lumen size are likely to lead to OSA by increasing the collapsibility of the upper airway. However, we did not show any significant association between regional fat distribution and propensity for hypoventilation, in this population.",Relationships between MRI fat distributions and sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome in very obese patients.
"Bromodomain and extraterminal motif (BET) proteins have been widely investigated for their roles in gene regulation and their potential as therapeutic targets in cancer. Pharmacologic BET inhibitors target the conserved bromodomain-acetyllysine interaction and do not distinguish between BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4. Thus, comparatively little is known regarding the distinct roles played by individual family members, as well as the underlying mechanisms that drive the transcriptional effects of BET inhibitors. Here we review studies regarding the contributions of BET proteins to genome structure and function, including recent work identifying a role for BRD2 as a component of functional and physical chromatin domain boundaries. We also discuss directions of future studies aimed at providing insights into broader architectural functions of BET proteins and their roles in chromatin domain boundary formation.",The Role of Bromodomain and Extraterminal Motif (BET) Proteins in Chromatin Structure.
": Research findings have consistently demonstrated that women living with HIV in the United States and globally experience declines in medication adherence and retention in care after giving birth. A number of studies have identified factors associated with postpartum retention in care, but the evidence base for interventions to address the problem and close this gap in the HIV care continuum is limited. Furthermore, the majority of studies have been conducted in low-resource or moderate-resource countries and may be less applicable or require adaptation for use in high resource countries. In the United States, up to two-thirds of women drop out of care after delivery and are unable to maintain or achieve viral suppression postpartum, at a time when maternal and pediatric health are closely linked. We conducted a critical review of the literature to identify existing gaps regarding maternal retention in the United States and conceptualize the problem through the lens of the integrated and ecological models of health behavior. This review describes existing barriers and facilitators to retention in HIV care postpartum from published studies and suggests steps that can be taken, using a multilevel approach, to improve maternal retention. We propose five core action steps related to increasing awareness of the problem of poor postpartum retention, addressing needs for improved care coordination and case management, and using novel approaches to adapt and implement peer support and technology-based interventions to improve postpartum retention and clinical outcomes of women living with HIV.",Improving postpartum retention in care for women living with HIV in the United States.
"PURPOSE: To study changes in the foveal microvascular anatomy using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) after intravenous chemotherapy (IVC) for retinoblastoma (RB). METHODS: A retrospective comparative case-control series included 10 age-matched normal eyes with no documented ocular pathology (control), 10 fellow eyes of patients with unilateral RB treated with IVC (RB fellow), and 10 eyes with extramacular RB in patients with bilateral RB treated with IVC (RB tumor). All eyes were scanned using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography and OCTA. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography measurements of central macular thickness and subfoveolar choroidal thickness as well as OCTA measurements of foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area in superficial (sFAZ) and deep (dFAZ) plexus and capillary density (CD) in the superficial (sCD) and deep (dCD) plexus were performed. Comparison among the three groups was conducted. RESULTS: Among the three cohorts (control, RB fellow, and RB tumor), there was no difference in mean age at measurement (12, 10, and 12 years) and mean interval between last IVC and OCTA (RB fellow and RB tumor) (9, 10 years). Optical coherence tomography and OCTA revealed no significant difference in central macular thickness (all P >/= 0.161), choroidal thickness (all P >/= 0.066), sFAZ (all P >/= 0.618), dFAZ (all P >/= 0.610), and sCD (all P >/= 0.638) comparing controls versus RB fellow, controls versus RB tumor, and RB fellow versus RB tumor. By contrast, mean dCD was significantly greater in controls (52%), compared with both RB fellow (49%, P = 0.026) and RB tumor (48%, P = 0.028) groups, but no difference was found between RB fellow and RB tumor (49% vs. 48%, P = 0.515). LogMAR visual acuity showed no difference among the three groups (all P >/= 0.150). CONCLUSION: At mean 10-year follow-up, slight reduction in dCD seems to occur after IVC for RB without alterations in central macular thickness, choroidal thickness, FAZ, or sCD and without visual compromise.",OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY FINDINGS OF DEEP CAPILLARY PLEXUS MICROISCHEMIA AFTER INTRAVENOUS CHEMOTHERAPY FOR RETINOBLASTOMA.
"One of the most substantial challenges facing the field of injury and violence prevention is bridging the gap between scientific knowledge and its real-world application to achieve population-level impact. Much synergy is gained when academic and practice communities collaborate; however, a number of barriers prevent better integration of science and practice.

"Individuals with chronic tic disorders (CTDs) frequently describe aversive subjective sensory sensations that precede their tics. The first aim of the present study was to explore the psychometric properties of a standardized self-report measure to assess premonitory urges in CTDs, The Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS), by replicating the analyses of Woods et al. (J Dev Behav Pediatr 26:397-403, 2005) using a sample twice the size of theirs. The second aim was to conduct an exploratory factor analysis of the PUTS. Eighty-four youth with CTDs, recruited from a pediatric OCD and tic specialty clinic, completed the PUTS while their caregivers completed The Parent Tic Questionnaire (PTQ) and a demographic measure. Consistent with (Woods et al. J Dev Behav Pediatr 26:397-403, 2005), the PUTS was found to be internally consistent (alpha = 0.82) and significantly correlated with overall tic severity as measured by the PTQ (r = 0.24, p < 0.05) as well as the PTQ number (r = 0.34, p < 0.01) and intensity (r = 0.24, p < 0.05) subscales. A factor-analysis of the PUTS revealed a two-factor solution with one factor capturing the quality of premonitory sensations while the other factor assessed the overall intensity of the urges. These results support the use of the PUTS in reliably measuring premonitory urges, particularly in children over the age of 10 years. Additionally, these findings highlight that urges are uniformly reported across gender and age and are more closely associated with number of tics than the frequency or intensity of tics.",Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS): replication and extension of psychometric properties in youth with chronic tic disorders (CTDs).
"AIM: To correlate the Pang and Lee class with the clinical course in a consecutive series of patients presenting with painful torticollis. METHODS: Forty-seven dynamic rotational computed tomography (CT) scans in 35 patients were classified into one of the five types defined by Pang and Li, including types I (atlantoaxial rotatopry fixation), II (""pathologic stickiness"" without crossover of C1 on C2), III (""pathologic stickiness"" with crossover of C1 on C2), IV (normal or muscular torticollis), and V (diagnostic grey zone). The Pang and Li class was then compared with the radiologist's report, which was graded abnormal, diagnosis of rotatory subluxation or fixation, or non-diagnostic. Medical records were reviewed and the clinical course was compared among the five sub-types. RESULTS: We reviewed 47 CT scans in 35 patients, and the majority were performed without sedation. The average age was 7.7 years (4-14 years old) and associated conditions included minor trauma (20%), surgical procedures around the head and neck (29%), and Grisels syndrome (20%). Twenty-six percent of our studies fell within the pathologic spectrum (5% type 1 or rotatory fixation, 21% types 2 and 3 or rotatory subluxation), while 45% were classified as muscular torticollis (45%) and 28% fell within the diagnostic grey zone. Seven radiologists interpreted these studies, and their interpretation was discordant in 45% of cases. Clinical resolution occurred in 27 of 29 cases for which follow-up was available. One of two patients with fixed rotatory subluxation required a C1-C2 arthrodesis. CONCLUSION: The Pang and Li classification characterizes a spectrum of abnormalities in rotation to facilitate communication, although the indications for dynamic CT scan should be further defined.",Atlantoaxial rotatory displacement in children.
"BACKGROUND: TNF-alpha is suggested to be involved in muscle damage and muscle inflammation (myositis). In order to evaluate whether TNF-alpha is involved in the myositis that occurs in response to muscle overuse, the aim was to examine the expression patterns of TNF receptors in this condition. METHODS: A rabbit muscle overuse model leading to myositis in the soleus muscle was used. The expression patterns of the two TNF receptors Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor type 1 (TNFR1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor type 2 (TNFR2) were investigated. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence were utilized. Immunostainings for desmin, NK-1R and CD31 were made in parallel. RESULTS: Immunoreactions (IR) for TNF receptors were clearly observed in white blood cells, fibroblasts and vessel walls, and most interestingly also in muscle fibers and nerve fascicles in the myositis muscles. There were very restricted reactions for these in the muscles of controls. The upregulation of TNF receptors was for all types of structures seen for both the experimental side and the contralateral nonexperimental side. TNF receptor expressing muscle fibers were present in myositis muscles. They can be related to attempts for reparation/regeneration, as evidenced from results of parallel stainings. Necrotic muscle fibers displayed TNFR1 mRNA and TNFR2 immunoreaction (IR) in the invading white blood cells. In myositis muscles, TNFR1 IR was observed in both axons and Schwann cells while TNFR2 IR was observed in Schwann cells. Such observations were very rarely made for control animals. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there is a pronounced involvement of TNF-alpha in the developing myositis process. Attempts for reparation of the muscle tissue seem to occur via both TNFR1 and TNFR2. As the myositis process also occurs in the nonexperimental side and as TNF receptors are confined to nerve fascicles bilaterally it can be asked whether TNF-alpha is involved in the spreading of the myositis process to the contralateral side via the nervous system. Taken together, the study shows that TNF-alpha is not only associated with the inflammation process but that both the muscular and nervous systems are affected and that this occurs both on experimental and nonexperimental sides.",Bilateral muscle fiber and nerve influences by TNF-alpha in response to unilateral muscle overuse - studies on TNF receptor expressions.

"OBJECTIVES: To examine, in a large, nationally representative sample of high school students, the association between bullying victimization and carrying weapons to school and to determine to what extent past experience of 1, 2, or 3 additional indicators of peer aggression increases the likelihood of weapon carrying by victims of bullying (VoBs). METHODS: National data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey were analyzed for grades 9 to 12 (N = 15 624). VoB groups were determined by self-report of being bullied at school and additional adverse experiences: fighting at school, being threatened or injured at school, and skipping school out of fear for one's safety. Weapon carrying was measured by a dichotomized (ie, >/=1 vs 0) report of carrying a gun, knife, or club on school property. VoB groups were compared with nonvictims with respect to weapon carrying by logistic regression adjusting for sex, grade, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: When surveyed, 20.2% of students reported being a VoB in the past year, and 4.1% reported carrying a weapon to school in the past month. VoBs experiencing 1, 2, or 3 additional risk factors were successively more likely to carry weapons to school. The subset of VoBs who experienced all 3 additional adverse experiences were more likely to carry weapons to school compared with nonvictims (46.4% vs 2.5%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians should recognize that VoBs, especially those who have experienced 1 or more indicators of peer aggression in conjunction, are at substantially increased risk of weapon carrying.",Weapon Carrying Among Victims of Bullying.
"The DNA damage response is an essential process for the survival of living cells. In a subset of stress-responsive genes in humans, Elongin controls transcription in response to multiple stimuli, such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, and heat shock. Yeast Elongin (Ela1-Elc1), along with Def1, is known to facilitate ubiquitylation and degradation of RNA polymerase II (pol II) in response to multiple stimuli, yet transcription activity has not been examined. We have found that Def1 copurifies from yeast whole-cell extract with TFIIH, the largest general transcription factor required for transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair. The addition of recombinant Def1 and Ela1-Elc1 enhanced transcription initiation in an in vitro reconstituted system including pol II, the general transcription factors, and TFIIS. Def1 also enhanced transcription restart from TFIIS-induced cleavage in a pol II transcribing complex. In the Deltadef1 strain, heat shock genes were misregulated, indicating that Def1 is required for induction of some stress-responsive genes in yeast. Taken together, our results extend the understanding of the molecular mechanism of transcription regulation on cellular stress and reveal functional similarities to the mammalian system.",Def1 interacts with TFIIH and modulates RNA polymerase II transcription.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cholesterol metabolism has been the object of intense investigation for decades. This review focuses on classical and novel methods assessing in vivo cholesterol metabolism in humans. Two factors have fueled cholesterol metabolism studies in the last few years: the renewed interest in the study of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) as an atheroprotective mechanism and the importance of the gut microbiome in affecting cholesterol metabolism. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent applications of these methods have spanned from the assessment of the effect on cholesterol synthesis, absorption or excretion of drugs (such as ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors and plant sterols) and the gut microbiome to the more complex assessment of transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE) and RCT.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss considerations of new paradigms for clinical drug development in pediatric oncology that incorporate our expanding knowledge and complexity of molecular alterations associated with cancer; advances in cancer immunology and cellular therapy; the increasing number of new anticancer drugs, therapeutic approaches, and potential combinations; and recent initiatives by regulatory agencies to improve access to safe and effective therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Cancer in children and adolescents is a rare event with significant long-term impact on individuals and society. Using multimodality therapy, stratified by patient and disease characteristics, the cure rate for childhood cancer exceeds 80%. Cancer genomics has transformed anticancer drug development. Understanding the genetic basis of pediatric cancers and the use of genomics for risk stratification has changed the focus of drug development from cytotoxic drugs to targeted therapeutic approaches. Advances in cancer immunology, immune checkpoint blockade, and cellular therapy offer novel approaches to harness T cells to treat cancer. To improve the outcome for children and adolescents with cancer and accelerate drug development, understanding drug and target interactions in preclinical models of pediatric cancer should be coupled with efficient clinical trial designs that incorporate biomarker selection, assessment of toxicity and drug exposure, and improved measures of response. SUMMARY: Clinical trials for children and adolescents with cancer evaluate cytotoxic drugs, molecularly target drugs, immunotherapy as well as combination therapies. The framework for oncology clinical trials will continually adapt to improve efficiency of trials and evaluate new therapeutic approaches.",Evolving paradigms for new agent development in pediatric oncology.
"Purpose To update the guideline recommendations on the use of larynx-preservation strategies in the treatment of laryngeal cancer. Methods An Expert Panel updated the systematic review of the literature for the period from January 2005 to May 2017. Results The panel confirmed that the use of a larynx-preservation approach for appropriately selected patients does not compromise survival. No larynx-preservation approach offered a survival advantage compared with total laryngectomy and adjuvant therapy as indicated. Changes were supported for the use of endoscopic surgical resection in patients with limited disease (T1, T2) and for initial total laryngectomy in patients with T4a disease or with severe pretreatment laryngeal dysfunction. New recommendations for positron emission tomography imaging for the evaluation of regional nodes after treatment and best measures for evaluating voice and swallowing function were added. Recommendations Patients with T1, T2 laryngeal cancer should be treated initially with intent to preserve the larynx by using endoscopic resection or radiation therapy, with either leading to similar outcomes. For patients with locally advanced (T3, T4) disease, organ-preservation surgery, combined chemotherapy and radiation, or radiation alone offer the potential for larynx preservation without compromising overall survival. For selected patients with extensive T3 or large T4a lesions and/or poor pretreatment laryngeal function, better survival rates and quality of life may be achieved with total laryngectomy. Patients with clinically involved regional cervical nodes (N+) who have a complete clinical and radiologic imaging response after chemoradiation do not require elective neck dissection. All patients should undergo a pretreatment baseline assessment of voice and swallowing function and receive counseling with regard to the potential impact of treatment options on voice, swallowing, and quality of life.

"Early identification of PCa patients at risk for biochemical recurrence (BCR) post-therapy will potentially complement definitive therapy with either neo- or adjuvant therapy to improve prognosis. BCR post definitive therapy is often associated with disease progression that might cause a bulge in the prostate gland. In this work we explored if an atlas-based comparison approach reveals shape differences in the prostate capsule as observed on pre-treatment T2-weighted MRI between prostate cancer patients who do (BCR (+)) and do not (BCR (-)) have BCR following definitive therapy. A single center IRB approved study included 874 patients. Complete image datasets, clinically localized PCa, availability of Gleason score, data available for post-treatment PSA and follow-up for at least 3 years in patients without BCR were the inclusion criteria to select 77 patients out of the 874 patients. Further controlling for Gleason score, stage, age and to maintain equal number of cases for the BCR (+) and BCR (-) categories, the total number of cases was reduced to 50. Manually segmented prostate capsules were aligned to a BCR (-) template for statistical comparison between the BCR (+) and BCR (-) groups. Statistically significant shape difference between the two groups was observed towards the lateral and the posterior sides of prostate.",Prostate shapes on pre-treatment MRI between prostate cancer patients who do and do not undergo biochemical recurrence are different: Preliminary Findings.

"AIM: To describe and quantify the out-of-pocket expenses, employment loss, and other financial impact related to caring for a child using home mechanical ventilation (HMV). METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of U.S. families with children who used HMV. Eligible participants were invited to complete a questionnaire addressing household and child characteristics, out-of-pocket expenses, employment loss/reduction, and financial stress. Participants were recruited with the help of three national patient registries. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-six participants from 32 states (152 with children who used invasive ventilation and 74 with children who used noninvasive ventilation) completed the questionnaire. Participants' median reported yearly household income was $90 000 (IQR 70 000-150 000). The median amount paid in out-of-pocket expenses in the previous 3 months to care for their child using HMV totaled $3899 (IQR $2900-4550). Reported levels of financial stress decreased as income increased; 37-60% of participants, depending on income quintile, reported moderate financial stress with ""some"" of that stress due to their out-of-pocket expenses. A substantial majority reported one or more household members stopped or reduced work and took unpaid weeks off of work to care for their child. CONCLUSION: The financial impact of caring for a child using HMV is considerable for some families. Providers need to understand these financial burdens and should inform families of them to help families anticipate and plan for them.",Survey of financial burden of families in the U.S. with children using home mechanical ventilation.

"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Shutter-speed model analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging allows estimation of mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (a measure of cellular energy metabolism) and volume transfer constant (a measure of hemodynamics). The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic utility of pretreatment mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant in predicting overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to stratify p16-positive patients based upon survival outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 60 patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging before treatment. Median, mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant values from metastatic nodes were computed from each patient. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to associate mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant and their combination with overall survival for the first 2 years, 5 years, and beyond (median duration, >7 years). RESULTS: By the last date of observation, 18 patients had died, and median follow-up for surviving patients (n = 42) was 8.32 years. Patients with high mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (4 deaths) had significantly (P = .01) prolonged overall survival by 5 years compared with those with low mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (13 deaths). Similarly, patients with high mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (4 deaths) had significantly (P = .006) longer overall survival at long-term duration than those with low mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (14 deaths). However, volume transfer constant was a significant predictor for only the 5-year follow-up period. There was some evidence (P < .10) to suggest that mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant were associated with overall survival for the first 2 years. Patients with high mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and high volume transfer constant were associated with significantly (P < .01) longer overall survival compared with other groups for all follow-up periods. In addition, p16-positive patients with high mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and high volume transfer constant demonstrated a trend toward the longest overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: A combined analysis of mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant provided the best model to predict overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.",Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI-Derived Intracellular Water Lifetime (tau i ): A Prognostic Marker for Patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas.
"The spectrum of Castleman disease (CD) has considerably extended since its first description in 1956. Recently, an international collaborative working group has reached consensus on the diagnostic criteria and classification of CD. We herein report 273 patients with lymph node histopathology consistent with CD and investigate the newly established diagnostic criteria. Twenty of these patients with Castleman-like histopathology were removed from analyses, because they were diagnosed with an exclusionary disorder (18 with haematological malignancy). Among the 253 remaining patients, 57 were considered unicentric CD (UCD), 169 were multicentric CD associated with Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8+MCD), including 140 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and 29 patients without HIV infection, and 27 were HHV-8 negative/idiopathic multicentric CD (iMCD). 2-((18) F)fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography was useful in 62 patients for staging/classification of the disease and for excluding associated lymphoma. UCD was mainly associated with hyaline-vascular histopathological features, and most patients were asymptomatic. Of the 27 patients that we had originally diagnosed with iMCD, 26 met the newly established diagnostic criteria. Patients with iMCD and HHV-8+ MCD demonstrated similar characteristics, including fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia and inflammatory symptoms. However, the disease was more aggressive in HHV-8+ MCD, particularly in HIV-infected patients.",The full spectrum of Castleman disease: 273 patients studied over 20 years.
"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of medical illness detected by laboratory screening in children entering foster care in a single, urban county. METHODS: All children entering foster care in a single county in Ohio were seen at a consultation foster care clinic and had laboratory screening, including testing for infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and tuberculosis as well as for hemoglobin and lead levels. RESULTS: Over a 3-year period (2012-2015), laboratory screening was performed on 1977 subjects entering foster care in a consultative foster care clinic. The prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and tuberculosis were all found to be <1%. There were no cases of HIV. Seven percent of teenagers entering foster care tested positive for Chlamydia. A secondary finding was that 54% of subjects were hepatitis B surface antibody-negative, indicating an absence of detected immunity to the hepatitis B virus. CONCLUSIONS: Routine laboratory screening for children entering foster care resulted in a low yield. Targeted, rather than routine, laboratory screening may be a more clinically meaningful approach for children entering foster care.",Laboratory Screening for Children Entering Foster Care.
"BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) infusion may lead to development of anti-IFX antibodies, and subsequent infusion reactions (IRs). The safety of rapid IFX infusion administered over 60 minutes has been under-investigated in children with inflammatory bowel disease. In a multicenter study, the frequency and nature of rapid infusion-associated IRs were examined. METHODS: The medical records of all consecutive children with inflammatory bowel disease receiving rapid IFX infusions between January 2014 and December 2016 were reviewed. Poisson regression analysis was used to identify possible associated factors with IRs. RESULTS: A total of 4120 rapid infusions for 453 children (median age 16 yrs [interquartile range 13.8-17.8], 289 males, 374 with Crohn's disease) were included. One hundred thirty-five participants (29.8%) received rapid IFX infusion for induction and maintenance while the rest received rapid IFX infusion after a median of 5 (interquartile range 4-9) standard infusions. The median dose of IFX using rapid protocol was 8 mg/kg/infusion (interquartile range 6-10). Two hundred sixty-seven (59%) patients received 1 or more premedications and 161 (35.5%) participants received concomitant immunosuppression. Twenty-one participants (4.6%) had IRs with rapid infusions and 2 participants discontinued IFX because of IRs (0.4%). Antihistamine premedications were associated with less frequent IR (adjusted relative risk = 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.64; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In children with inflammatory bowel disease, rapid IFX infusion administered over 60 minutes is safe and well-tolerated. Antihistamine premedications may reduce frequency of IRs (see Video Abstract, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/IBD/B632).",Rapid Infliximab Infusion in Children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Multicenter North American Experience.
"Clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of analgesics across all pediatric age cohorts are needed to avoid inappropriate extrapolation of adult data to children. However, the selection of acute pain models and trial design attributes to maximize assay sensitivity, by pediatric age cohort, remains problematic. Acute pain models used for drug treatment trials in adults are not directly applicable to the pediatric age cohorts-neonates, infants, toddlers, children, and adolescents. Developmental maturation of metabolic enzymes in infants and children must be taken into consideration when designing trials to test analgesic treatments for acute pain. Assessment tools based on the levels of cognitive maturation and behavioral repertoire must be selected as outcome measures. Models and designs of clinical trials of analgesic medications used in the treatment of acute pain in neonates, infants, toddlers, children, and adolescents were reviewed and discussed at an Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) Pediatric Pain Research Consortium consensus meeting. Based on extensive reviews and continuing discussions, the authors recommend a number of acute pain clinical trial models and design attributes that have the potential to improve the study of analgesic medications in pediatric populations. Recommendations are also provided regarding additional research needed to support the use of other acute pain models across pediatric age cohorts.","Clinical trial designs and models for analgesic medications for acute pain in neonates, infants, toddlers, children, and adolescents: ACTTION recommendations."

"BACKGROUND: VRC01 is an HIV-1 CD4 binding site broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) that is active against a broad range of HIV-1 primary isolates in vitro and protects against simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) when delivered parenterally to nonhuman primates. It has been shown to be safe and well tolerated after short-term administration in humans; however, its clinical and functional activity after longer-term administration has not been previously assessed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) 104 was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of VRC01 administered either subcutaneously or by intravenous (IV) infusion and to assess the pharmacokinetics and in vitro immunologic activity of the different dosing regimens. Additionally, this study aimed to assess the effect that the human body has on the functional activities of VRC01 as measured by several in vitro assays. Eighty-eight healthy, HIV-uninfected, low-risk participants were enrolled in 6 United States clinical research sites affiliated with the HVTN between September 9, 2014, and July 15, 2015. The median age of enrollees was 27 years (range, 18-50); 52% were White (non-Hispanic), 25% identified as Black (non-Hispanic), 11% were Hispanic, and 11% were non-Hispanic people of diverse origins. Participants were randomized to receive the following: a 40 mg/kg IV VRC01 loading dose followed by five 20 mg/kg IV VRC01 doses every 4 weeks (treatment group 1 [T1], n = 20); eleven 5 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) VRC01 (treatment group 3 [T3], n = 20); placebo (placebo group 3 [P3], n = 4) doses every 2 weeks; or three 40 mg/kg IV VRC01 doses every 8 weeks (treatment group 2 [T2], n = 20). Treatment groups T4 and T5 (n = 12 each) received three 10 or 30 mg/kg IV VRC01 doses every 8 weeks, respectively. Participants were followed for 32 weeks after their first VRC01 administration and received a total of 249 IV infusions and 208 SC injections, with no serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, nor evidence for anti-VRC01 antibodies observed. Serum VRC01 levels were detected through 12 weeks after final administration in all participants who received all scheduled doses. Mean peak serum VRC01 levels of 1,177 mug/ml (95% CI: 1,033, 1,340) and 420 mug/ml (95% CI: 356, 494) were achieved 1 hour after the IV infusion series of 30 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively. Mean trough levels at week 24 in the IV infusion series of 30 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively, were 16 mug/ml (95% CI: 10, 27) and 6 mug/ml (95% CI: 5, 9) levels, which neutralize a majority of circulating strains in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] > 5 mug/ml). Post-infusion/injection serum VRC01 retained expected functional activity (virus neutralization, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, and virion capture). The limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size of each VRC01 administration regimen and missing data from participants who were unable to complete all study visits. CONCLUSIONS: VRC01 administered as either an IV infusion (10-40 mg/kg) given monthly or bimonthly, or as an SC injection (5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks, was found to be safe and well tolerated. In addition to maintaining drug concentrations consistent with neutralization of the majority of tested HIV strains, VRC01 concentrations from participants' sera were found to avidly capture HIV virions and to mediate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, suggesting a range of anti-HIV immunological activities, warranting further clinical trials.

"OBJECTIVES: Studies of cancer recurrences and second primary tumors require information on outcome dates. Little is known about how well electronic health record-based algorithms can identify dates or how errors in dates can bias analyses. RESEARCH DESIGN: We assessed rule-based and model-fitting approaches to assign event dates using a previously published electronic health record-based algorithm for second breast cancer events (SBCE). We conducted a simulation study to assess bias due to date assignment errors in time-to-event analyses. SUBJECTS: From a cohort of 3152 early-stage breast cancer patients, 358 women accurately identified as having had an SBCE served as the basis for this analysis. MEASURES: Percent of predicted SBCE dates identified within +/-60 days of the true date was the primary measure of accuracy. In the simulation study, bias in hazard ratios (HRs) was estimated by averaging the difference between HRs based on algorithm-assigned dates and the true HR across 1000 simulations each with simulated N=4000. RESULTS: The most accurate date algorithm had a median difference between the true and predicted dates of 0 days with 82% of predicted dates falling within 60 days of the true date. Bias resulted when algorithm sensitivity and specificity varied by exposure status, but was minimal when date assignment errors were of the magnitude observed for our date assignment method. CONCLUSIONS: SBCE date can be relatively accurately assigned based on a previous algorithm. While acceptable in many scenarios, algorithm-assigned dates are not appropriate to use when operating characteristics are likely to vary by the study exposure.",An Electronic Health Record-based Algorithm to Ascertain the Date of Second Breast Cancer Events.
"BACKGROUND: Multiple echocardiographic methods are used to measure left ventricular size and function. Clinical management is based on individual evaluations and longitudinal trends. The Pediatric Heart Network VVV study (Ventricular Volume Variability) in pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy has reported reproducibility of several of these measures, and how disease state and number of beats impact their reproducibility. In this study, we investigated the impact of observer and sonographer variation on reproducibility of dimension, area, and volume methods to determine the best method for both individual and sequential evaluations. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 8 centers, echocardiograms were obtained on 169 patients prospectively. During the same visit, 2 different sonographers acquired the same imaging protocol on each patient. Each acquisition was analyzed by 2 different observers; first observer analyzed the first acquisition twice. Intraobserver, interobserver, interacquisition, and interobserver-acquisition (different observers and different acquisition) reproducibility were assessed on measurements of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, area, and volume. Left ventricular shortening fraction, ejection fraction, mass, and fractional area change were calculated. Percent difference was calculated as (interobservation difference/mean)x100. Interobserver reproducibility for both acquisitions was better for both volume and dimension measurements (P</=0.002) compared with area measurements, whereas intraobserver, interacquisition (for both observers), and interobserver-acquisition reproducibilities (for both observer-acquisition sets) were best for volume measurements (P</=0.01). Overall, interobserver-acquisition percent differences were significantly higher than interobserver and interacquisition percent differences (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, compared with dimension and area methods, left ventricular measurements by volume method have the best reproducibility in settings where assessment is not performed by the same personnel.

"Physicians have an important role addressing the obesity epidemic. Lack of adequate teaching to provide weight management counseling (WMC) is cited as a reason for limited treatment. National guidelines have not been translated into an evidence-supported, competency-based curriculum in medical schools. Weight Management Counseling in Medical Schools: A Randomized Controlled Trial (MSWeight) is designed to determine if a multi-modal theoretically-guided WMC educational intervention improves observed counseling skills and secondarily improve perceived skills and self-efficacy among medical students compared to traditional education (TE). Eight U.S. medical schools were pair-matched and randomized in a group randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether a multi-modal education (MME) intervention compared to traditional education (TE) improves observed WMC skills. The MME intervention includes innovative components in years 1-3: a structured web-course; a role play exercise, WebPatientEncounter, and an enhanced outpatient internal medicine or family medicine clerkship. This evidence-supported curriculum uses the 5As framework to guide treatment and incorporates patient-centered counseling to engage the patient. The primary outcome is a comparison of scores on an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) WMC case among third year medical students. The secondary outcome compares changes in scores of medical students from their first to third year on an assessment of perceived WMC skills and self-efficacy. MSWeight is the first RCT in medical schools to evaluate whether interventions integrated into the curriculum improve medical students' WMC skills. If this educational approach for teaching WMC is effective, feasible and acceptable it can affect how medical schools integrate WMC teaching into their curriculum.",Design and rationale of the medical students learning weight management counseling skills (MSWeight) group randomized controlled trial.

"BACKGROUND: Residency programs use electronic portfolios (efolios) to organize data, track resident performance, and sometimes teach and assess lifelong learning (LLL) skills. Published studies on efolios in graduate medical education are mostly descriptions of implementation at individual institutions. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was sent to 199 pediatric residency program directors across the United States. Efolio usage patterns were described and compared between program directors that perceived efolios effective at fostering LLL and those that did not. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 82 of 199 program directors (41%), and 55% used efolios. The 20% (9 of 45) of program directors that believed efolios were effective at teaching LLL more often used self-assessment (88% vs. 50%, p = 0.05) and goal-setting (75% vs. 40%, p = 0.03) functionalities. Common efolio challenges included limited usability and difficulty integrating data. Most non-users (65%) would like to invest in efolios. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents reported technical and convenience-related challenges to efolio use, which need to be addressed for efolios to meet their potential as valuable learning tools. The use of self-assessments and goal-setting features was associated with program directors' perceptions that efolios were effective at fostering LLL.",Electronic portfolio use in pediatric residency and perceived efficacy as a tool for teaching lifelong learning.
"Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is an inherited syndrome characterized by abnormal lymphocyte survival caused by failure of apoptotic mechanisms to maintain lymphocyte homeostasis. This failure leads to the clinical manifestations of non-infectious and non-malignant lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and autoimmune pathology, most commonly, autoimmune cytopenias. Since ALPS was first characterized in the early 1990s, insights in disease biology have improved both diagnosis and management of this syndrome. Sirolimus is the best-studied and most effective corticosteroid-sparing therapy for ALPS and should be considered first-line for patients in need of chronic treatment. This review highlights practical clinical considerations for the diagnosis and management of ALPS. Further studies could reveal new proteins and regulatory pathways that are critical for lymphocyte activation and apoptosis.",Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome: more than a FAScinating disease.
"BACKGROUND: With their increasing availability in resource-limited settings, mobile phones may provide an important tool for participatory syndromic surveillance, in which users provide symptom data directly into a centralized database. OBJECTIVE: We studied the performance of a mobile phone app-based participatory syndromic surveillance system for collecting syndromic data (acute febrile illness and acute gastroenteritis) to detect dengue virus and norovirus on a cohort of children living in a low-resource and rural area of Guatemala. METHODS: Randomized households were provided with a mobile phone and asked to submit weekly reports using a symptom diary app (Vigilant-e). Participants reporting acute febrile illness or acute gastroenteritis answered additional questions using a decision-tree algorithm and were subsequently visited at home by a study nurse who performed a second interview and collected samples for dengue virus if confirmed acute febrile illness and norovirus if acute gastroenteritis. We analyzed risk factors associated with decreased self-reporting of syndromic data using the Vigilant-e app and evaluated strategies to improve self-reporting. We also assessed agreement between self-report and nurse-collected data obtained during home visits. RESULTS: From April 2015 to June 2016, 469 children in 207 households provided 471 person-years of observation. Mean weekly symptom reporting rate was 78% (range 58%-89%). Households with a poor (<70%) weekly reporting rate using the Vigilant-e app during the first 25 weeks of observation (n=57) had a greater number of children (mean 2.8, SD 1.5 vs mean 2.5, SD 1.3; risk ratio [RR] 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4), were less likely to have used mobile phones for text messaging at study enrollment (61%, 35/57 vs 76.7%, 115/150; RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9), and were less likely to access care at the local public clinic (35%, 20/57 vs 67.3%, 101/150; RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.6). Parents of female enrolled participants were more likely to have low response rate (57.1%, 84/147 vs 43.8%, 141/322; RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9). Several external factors (cellular tower collapse, contentious elections) were associated with periods of decreased reporting. Poor response rate (<70%) was associated with lower case reporting of acute gastroenteritis, norovirus-associated acute gastroenteritis, acute febrile illness, and dengue virus-associated acute febrile illness (P<.001). Parent-reported syndromic data on the Vigilant-e app demonstrated agreement with nurse-collected data for fever (kappa=.57, P<.001), vomiting (kappa=.63, P<.001), and diarrhea (kappa=.61, P<.001), with decreased agreement as the time interval between parental report and nurse home visit increased (<1 day: kappa=.65-.70; >/=2 days: kappa=.08-.29). CONCLUSIONS: In a resource-limited area of rural Guatemala, a mobile phone app-based participatory syndromic surveillance system demonstrated a high reporting rate and good agreement between parental reported data and nurse-reported data during home visits. Several household-level and external factors were associated with decreased syndromic reporting. Poor reporting rate was associated with decreased syndromic and pathogen-specific case ascertainment.",Performance of a Mobile Phone App-Based Participatory Syndromic Surveillance System for Acute Febrile Illness and Acute Gastroenteritis in Rural Guatemala.
"We report the discovery and medicinal chemistry optimization of a novel series of pyrazole-based inhibitors of human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Utilization of a quantitative high-throughput screening paradigm facilitated hit identification, while structure-based design and multiparameter optimization enabled the development of compounds with potent enzymatic and cell-based inhibition of LDH enzymatic activity. Lead compounds such as 63 exhibit low nM inhibition of both LDHA and LDHB, submicromolar inhibition of lactate production, and inhibition of glycolysis in MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer and A673 sarcoma cells. Moreover, robust target engagement of LDHA by lead compounds was demonstrated using the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and drug-target residence time was determined via SPR. Analysis of these data suggests that drug-target residence time (off-rate) may be an important attribute to consider for obtaining potent cell-based inhibition of this cancer metabolism target.","Discovery and Optimization of Potent, Cell-Active Pyrazole-Based Inhibitors of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)."

"While more women are in leadership positions in academic medicine now than ever before in U.S. history, evidence from recent surveys of women and graduating medical students demonstrates that sexual harassment continues in academic health centers. Academic medicine's ability to change its culture is hampered by victims' fear of reporting episodes of harassment, which is largely due to fear of retaliation. In this Perspective, the authors describe efforts in scientific societies to address the issue of sexual harassment and to begin to establish safe environments at national meetings.

"Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is an autoimmune rheumatic disorder that is characterized by fibrosis, vascular dysfunction, and autoantibody production that involves most visceral organs. It is characterized by a high morbidity and mortality rate, mainly due to disease-related complications. Epidemiological data describing mortality and survival in this population have been based on both population and observational studies. Multiple clinical and non-clinical factors have been found to predict higher likelihood of death among thepatients. Here, we do an extensive review of the available literature, utilizing the PubMed database, to describe scleroderma and non-scleroderma related determinants of mortality in this population. We found that even though the mortality among the general population has declined, scleroderma continues to carry a very high morbidity and mortality rate, however we have made some slow progress in improving the mortality among scleroderma patients over the last few decades.",Determinants of mortality in systemic sclerosis: a focused review.
"OBJECTIVE: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disease with very high levels of circulating low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels that leads to accelerated atherosclerosis. Lipoprotein apheresis is an effective treatment option for patients with FH and results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) are markers of overall vascular health and diminished levels have been associated with decreased reparative potential and worse outcomes. We assessed the short-term change in CPC levels following a single lipoprotein apheresis session in FH patients who are already on stable lipoprotein apheresis therapy. We hypothesized that in addition to a reduction in atherogenic lipids, the cardiovascular benefit from lipoprotein apheresis therapy is mediated by enhanced vascular reparative capacity through mobilization of CPCs. METHODS: Eight FH patients (1 homozygous and 7 heterozygous) on stable lipoprotein apheresis therapy for at least three months had CPCs measured at baseline (prior to apheresis) and two hours after apheresis. Results were compared with data from age-matched hyperlipidemic (HLP) patients on statin therapy and healthy volunteers. RESULTS: FH patients had higher baseline circulating levels of CD34+/CD133+ and CD34+/CD133+/CXCR4+ cells compared to HLP and healthy subjects. There was no significant change in CPCs after apheresis in FH patients. CONCLUSIONS: FH patients had higher CPC counts at baseline compared to age-matched HLP and healthy controls, suggesting activation of reparative mechanism in this high risk population. Larger studies are needed to better characterize differences in CPC counts between FH subjects and HLP patients over time.",Circulating progenitor cells in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
"OBJECTIVE: To characterize exercise behaviors among adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN), atypical AN, or bulimia nervosa (BN), and determine associations between exercise and medical risk. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional electronic medical records of all patients evaluated by the Eating Disorder Program at Stanford between January 1997 and February 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: 1,083 subjects (961 females, 122 males; mean age 15.6) met eligibility criteria. Most patients (89.7%) reported exercise (mean 7.0 h per week over mean 5.4 days per week) prior to presentation. Running (49.9%), calisthenics (40.7%), walking (23.4%), soccer (20.9%), and swimming (18.2%) were the most common exercises; a majority (60.6%) reported team sport participation. Males were less likely to report team exercise (p = .005). Bradycardia (heart rate <50) at presentation was associated with team sport participation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.72) and hours of exercise per week (AOR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09), controlling for diagnosis, sex, age, duration of illness, rate of weight loss, and percent median body mass index (%mBMI). DISCUSSION: Adolescents with AN, atypical AN, and BN reported high levels of exercise. Females reported more team sport participation. Greater exercise frequency and team sport participation were associated with bradycardia.

"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the psychometric properties of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) 2-question alcohol screen within 16 Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network pediatric emergency departments. This article describes the study methodology, sample characteristics, and baseline outcomes of the NIAAA 2-question screen. METHODS: Participants included 12- to 17-year-olds treated in one of the participating pediatric emergency departments across the United States. After enrollment, a criterion assessment battery including the NIAAA 2-question screen and other measures of alcohol, drug use, and risk behavior was self-administered by participants on a tablet computer. Two subsamples were derived from the sample. The first subsample was readministered the NIAAA 2-question screen 1 week after their initial visit to assess test-retest reliability. The second subsample is being reassessed at 12 and 24 months to examine predictive validity of the NIAAA 2-question screen. RESULTS: There were 4834 participants enrolled into the study who completed baseline assessments. Participants were equally distributed across sex and age. Forty-six percent of the participants identified as white, and 26% identified as black. Approximately one quarter identified as Hispanic. Using the NIAAA 2-question screen algorithm, approximately 8% were classified as low risk, 12% were classified as moderate risk, and 4% were classified as highest risk. Alcohol use was less likely to be reported by black participants, non-Hispanic participants, and those younger than 16 years. DISCUSSION: This study successfully recruited a large, demographically diverse sample to establish rates of the NIAAA screen risk categories across age, sex, ethnicity, and race within pediatric emergency departments.",Methodology and Demographics of a Brief Adolescent Alcohol Screen Validation Study.
"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand pediatric emergency department (ED) and primary care (PC) health care provider attitudes and beliefs regarding the intersection between childhood adversities and health care. METHODS: We conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews in 2 settings (ED and PC) within an urban health care system. Purposive sampling was used to balance the sample among 3 health care provider roles. Interview questions were based on a modified health beliefs model exploring the ""readiness to act"" among providers. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded. Interviews continued until theme saturation was reached. RESULTS: Saturation was achieved after 26 ED and 19 PC interviews. Emergency department/primary care providers were similar in their perception of patient susceptibility to childhood adversity. Childhood mental health problems were the most frequently referenced adverse outcome, followed by poor childhood physical health. Adult health outcomes because of childhood adversity were rarely mentioned. Many providers felt that knowing about childhood adversity in the medical setting was important because it relates to provision of tangible resources. There were mixed opinions about whether or not pediatric health care providers should be identifying childhood adversities at all. CONCLUSIONS: Although providers exhibited knowledge about childhood adversity, the perceived effect on health was only immediate and tangible. The effect of childhood adversity on lifelong health and the responsibility and potential accountability health systems have in addressing these important health determinants was not recognized by many respondents in our study. Addressing these provider perspectives will be a critical component of successful transformation toward more accountable health care delivery systems.",Pediatric Emergency Department and Primary Care Provider Attitudes on Assessing Childhood Adversity.
"OBJECTIVE: Alarm fatigue is a widely recognized safety and quality problem where exposure to high rates of clinical alarms results in desensitization leading to dismissal of or slowed response to alarms.

We asked a primary key question; ""what interventions have been attempted and resulted in the success of reducing alarm fatigue?"" and 3-secondary key questions; ""what are the negative effects on patients/families; what are the balancing outcomes (unintended consequences of interventions); and what human factor approaches apply to making an effective alarm?"" DATA EXTRACTION: Articles relevant to the Key Questions were selected through an iterative review process and relevant data was extracted using a standardized tool. DATA SYNTHESIS: We found 62 articles that had relevant and usable data for at least one key question. We found that no study used/developed a clear definition of ""alarm fatigue."" For our primary key question 1, the relevant studies focused on three main areas: quality improvement/bundled activities; intervention comparisons; and analysis of algorithm-based false and total alarm suppression. All sought to reduce the number of total alarms and/or false alarms to improve the positive predictive value. Most studies were successful to varying degrees. None measured alarm fatigue directly. CONCLUSIONS: There is no agreed upon valid metric(s) for alarm fatigue, and the current methods are mostly indirect. Assuming that reducing the number of alarms and/or improving positive predictive value can reduce alarm fatigue, there are promising avenues to address patient safety and quality problem. Further investment is warranted not only in interventions that may reduce alarm fatigue but also in defining how to best measure it.",Technological Distractions (Part 2): A Summary of Approaches to Manage Clinical Alarms With Intent to Reduce Alarm Fatigue.
"Current antiseizure therapy is ineffective in approximately one third of people with epilepsy and is often associated with substantial side effects. In addition, most current therapeutic paradigms offer treatment, but not cure, and no therapies are able to modify the underlying disease, that is, can prevent or halt the process of epileptogenesis or alleviate the cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities. Preclinical research in the field of epilepsy has been extensive, but unfortunately, not all the animal models being used have been validated for their predictive value. The overall goal of TASK2 of the AES/ILAE Translational Task Force is to organize and coordinate systematic reviews on selected topics regarding animal research in epilepsy. Herein we describe our strategy. In the first part of the paper we provide an overview of the usefulness of systematic reviews and meta-analysis for preclinical research and explain the essentials for their conduct. Then we describe in detail the protocol for a first systematic review, which will focus on the identification and characterization of outcome measures reported in animal models of epilepsy. The specific goals of this study are to define systematically the phenotypic characteristics of the most commonly used animal models, and to effectively compare these with the manifestations of human epilepsy. This will provide epilepsy researchers with detailed information on the strengths and weaknesses of epilepsy models, facilitating their refinement and future research. Ultimately, this could lead to a refined use of relevant models for understanding the mechanism(s) of the epilepsies and developing novel therapies.",Identification and characterization of outcome measures reported in animal models of epilepsy: Protocol for a systematic review of the literature-A TASK2 report of the AES/ILAE Translational Task Force of the ILAE.
"Anesthesiologists are increasingly called on to care for pediatric patients undergoing diagnostic imaging and invasive procedures in interventional radiology. These procedures are typically classified as either nonvascular or vascular, and can range from short diagnostic imaging studies or biopsies to significantly longer and more invasive intravascular procedures. Anesthesia providers must consider each child's ability to cooperate reliably during the procedure, their age, and any cognitive impairment to define the best anesthetic plan. Several unique pediatric patient populations with specific procedural implications and anesthetic considerations who will benefit from additional periprocedural planning are discussed.",Pediatric Anesthesia Considerations for Interventional Radiology.
"BACKGROUND: There are approximately 2000 mobile health clinics operating in the United States. While researchers have established that mobile health clinics can be cost effective and improve outcomes, there is scant research examining the healthcare experience on a mobile health clinic from patients' perspectives. METHODS: Data were gathered from interviews with 25 clients receiving care on a Boston-based mobile health clinic and analyzed using grounded theory methodology. RESULTS: Emerging patterns in the data revealed three relational and three structural factors most significant to participants' experience of care on The Family Van. Relational factors include providers who 1) Communicate understandably, 2) Create a culture of respect and inclusivity, and 3) Are diverse with knowledge of the community. Structural factors include 1) A focus on preventative health and managing chronic disease, 2) Expeditious, free, and multiple services, and 3) Location. CONCLUSIONS: The participant accounts in this report serve to expand on prior research exploring mobile health clinics' role in patients' healthcare, to more clearly define the most salient aspects of the mobile health clinic model for the patients they serve, and to give voice to patients too seldom heard in the academic literature.","Preventative health, diversity, and inclusion: a qualitative study of client experience aboard a mobile health clinic in Boston, Massachusetts."
"Apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) is a small exchangeable apolipoprotein found on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), such as chylomicrons (CM) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and on high-density lipoproteins (HDL), particularly during fasting. ApoC-II plays a critical role in TRL metabolism by acting as a cofactor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the main enzyme that hydrolyses plasma triglycerides (TG) on TRL. Here, we present an overview of the role of apoC-II in TG metabolism, emphasizing recent novel findings regarding its transcriptional regulation and biochemistry. We also review the 24 genetic mutations in the APOC2 gene reported to date that cause hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). Finally, we describe the clinical presentation of apoC-II deficiency and assess the current therapeutic approaches, as well as potential novel emerging therapies.","Apolipoprotein C-II: New findings related to genetics, biochemistry, and role in triglyceride metabolism."
"BACKGROUND: Congenital infantile fibrosarcoma (CIF) is rare and represents less than 1% of all childhood cancers. It is a tumor that originates in the connective fibrous tissue found at the ends of long bones and then spreads to other surrounding soft tissues. These lesions are typically large, grow rapidly, and can often be mistaken for teratomas. Diagnosis is confirmed by pathology, where cellular proliferation of fibroblasts occurs. Imaging is an important part of the diagnosis, which includes the use of magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography scan. Although surgical resection is the primary treatment, chemotherapeutic agents may be used as adjuvant therapy. PURPOSE: To describe modalities for accurate diagnosis and treatment of CIF. METHODS/SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed was searched using terms ""congenital infantile fibrosarcoma"" and ""infantile fibrosarcoma."" Eleven relevant, English language articles were identified and utilized in the preparation of this case presentation. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Complications addressed in this case presentation are prenatal diagnostic challenges, pharmacologic interventions in the setting of prematurity, immunosuppression, and acute liver and renal failure. Pharmacologic treatments will include chemotherapy agents, antimicrobial agents, as well as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for immunosuppression. Nursing challenges included positioning and integumentary disturbances. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Utilization of diagnostic imaging and pathology to accurately identify and diagnose CIF is essential. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Safety and efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents in premature infants with CIF need to be established.",Congenital Infantile Fibrosarcoma in the Premature Infant.
"Noncontact low-frequency ultrasound (NLFU) is used to treat various types of chronic wounds including venous, diabetic, and pressure ulcers. The objective for this substudy of the IN BALANCE RCT VLU trial was to characterize and compare the NLFU treatment group and patients receiving standard of care (SOC) with respect to the effect of the assigned study treatment on content/quantity of inflammatory cytokines and fibrinogen as well as bacteria. Higher mean wound area reduction was observed in the NLFU treatment group (67.0%) compared to the SOC group (41.6%, p < 0.05). Hypertension, diabetes type II, coronary artery disease, and anemia were identified as the most common comorbidities of the Chronic venous leg ulcer (CVLU) patients included in the study. Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, and unclassified Enterobacteriaceae were dominant in the highest number of samples. Anaerococcus, Peptoniphilus, and Finegoldia, had the highest median proportion in the samples overall. Peptoniphilus abundance decreased more in the NLFU treatment group relative to SOC; similar trends were observed for Anaerococcus and Finegoldia. Progression of mediators like TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 as well as PF4, TGF-beta, and fibrinogen was monitored and trends for several of the mediators were identified. Fibrinogen amounts were significantly reduced over time in the NLFU treatment group (p < 0.05). IL-8 levels declined in wound fluid from NLFU responders as well as SOC responders. Bacterial load (total bacterial abundance) determined local parameters of ulcer inflammation. If a bioburden of >/= 10E(5) was found compared to < 10E(5) , levels of IL-1beta, IL-8, and TNF-alpha were significantly higher. In conclusion, NLFU treatment is an effective adjuvant tool for CVLU therapy. This study demonstrates that it improves wound healing by equally inhibiting abundant levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as by reducing the overall bacterial burden.",Does noncontact low-frequency ultrasound therapy contribute to wound healing at the molecular level?
"Young adult solid organ transplant recipients who transfer from pediatric to adult care experience poor outcomes related to decreased adherence to the medical regimen. Our pilot trial for young adults who had heart transplant (HT) who transfer to adult care tests an intervention focused on increasing HT knowledge, self-management and self-advocacy skills, and enhancing support, as compared to usual care. We report baseline findings between groups regarding (1) patient-level outcomes and (2) components of the intervention. From 3/14 to 9/16, 88 subjects enrolled and randomized to intervention (n = 43) or usual care (n = 45) at six pediatric HT centers. Patient self-report questionnaires and medical records data were collected at baseline, and 3 and 6 months after transfer. For this report, baseline findings (at enrollment and prior to transfer to adult care) were analyzed using Chi-square and t-tests. Level of significance was p < 0.05. Baseline demographics were similar in the intervention and usual care arms: age 21.3 +/- 3.2 vs 21.5 +/- 3.3 years and female 44% vs 49%, respectively. At baseline, there were no differences between intervention and usual care for use of tacrolimus (70 vs 62%); tacrolimus level (mean +/- SD = 6.5 +/- 2.3 ng/ml vs 5.6 +/- 2.3 ng/ml); average of the within patient standard deviation of the baseline mean tacrolimus levels (1.6 vs 1.3); and adherence to the medical regimen [3.6 +/- 0.4 vs 3.5 +/- 0.5 (1 = hardly ever to 4 = all of the time)], respectively. At baseline, both groups had a modest amount of HT knowledge, were learning self-management and self-advocacy, and perceived they were adequately supported. Baseline findings indicate that transitioning HT recipients lack essential knowledge about HT and have incomplete self-management and self-advocacy skills.",Pediatric Heart Transplantation: Transitioning to Adult Care (TRANSIT): Baseline Findings.
"Children with autism spectrum disorder have deficits in adaptive functioning. This study examines the adaptive behavior, its association with cognitive ability, gender, age, and symptom severity in children with autism spectrum disorder. Using data from Autism Treatment Network registry, the adaptive behavior profiles were examined in 2538 school-aged children (between 5 and 17 years, mean: 8.8 years, standard deviation: 3.0) who had an overall intelligence quotient and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale scores available. The children were grouped according to their intelligence quotient (low intelligence quotient < 70; borderline intelligence quotient = 70-85; average intelligence quotient > 85), age (5-10 and 11-17 years), and gender for the analyses. Significantly lower Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale scores were found in borderline and average intelligence quotient groups when compared to mean intelligence quotient, while an opposite pattern was seen in the low intelligence quotient group, with better adaptive behavior scores than mean intelligence quotient. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale standard scores were positively correlated with intelligence quotient and poorly associated with autism spectrum disorder severity. Younger children had significantly higher Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale scores. Adjusted comparisons by gender were not significant. Adaptive behavior profiles in the intelligence quotient categories are discussed. This study confirms a positive relationship between adaptive behavior and intellectual function in autism and indicates that children with higher intelligence quotient and older age are specifically impaired, with lower adaptive behavior, highlighting the need for assessment and targeted intervention in these groups. Future directions for research are discussed.",Correlates of adaptive behavior profiles in a large cohort of children with autism: The autism speaks Autism Treatment Network registry data.

"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to explore current community emergency department (ED) experiences available to pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) trainees and estimate the proportion of graduates taking positions that involve working in a community ED setting. METHODS: We conducted an e-mail-based survey among PEM fellowship directors and assistant directors. RESULTS: There were 55 program director respondents (74% response rate). Thirty-one percent of the surveyed PEM fellowship programs provide training exposure to a community ED setting. Twenty-nine percent of the surveyed programs reported that 25% to 49% of graduating trainees accepted positions that involve working in a community hospital ED setting, 13% responded 50% to 74%, and 4% report 75% to 100% from 2012 to 2016. CONCLUSIONS: There is an overall paucity of a dedicated community rotation for PEM trainees, yet many graduates are seeking employment in community-based EDs. Because the need for community-based PEM physicians continues to rise and to adequately prepare the PEM workforce, PEM fellowship training should consider a curriculum that includes community-based ED clinical experiences.",Clinical Experience in a Community Setting During Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellowship Training.
"SUMMARYThe cytoskeleton is the major mechanical structure of the cell; it is a complex, dynamic biopolymer network comprising microtubules, actin, and intermediate filaments. Both the individual filaments and the entire network are not simple elastic solids but are instead highly nonlinear structures. Appreciating the mechanics of biopolymer networks is key to understanding the mechanics of cells. Here, we review the mechanical properties of cytoskeletal polymers and discuss the implications for the behavior of cells.",Mechanical Properties of the Cytoskeleton and Cells.

"Genetic defects that affect intestinal epithelial barrier function can present with very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD). Using whole-genome sequencing, a novel hemizygous defect in NOX1 encoding NAPDH oxidase 1 was identified in a patient with ulcerative colitis-like VEOIBD. Exome screening of 1,878 pediatric patients identified further seven male inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with rare NOX1 mutations. Loss-of-function was validated in p.N122H and p.T497A, and to a lesser degree in p.Y470H, p.R287Q, p.I67M, p.Q293R as well as the previously described p.P330S, and the common NOX1 SNP p.D360N (rs34688635) variant. The missense mutation p.N122H abrogated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cell lines, ex vivo colonic explants, and patient-derived colonic organoid cultures. Within colonic crypts, NOX1 constitutively generates a high level of ROS in the crypt lumen. Analysis of 9,513 controls and 11,140 IBD patients of non-Jewish European ancestry did not reveal an association between p.D360N and IBD. Our data suggest that loss-of-function variants in NOX1 do not cause a Mendelian disorder of high penetrance but are a context-specific modifier. Our results implicate that variants in NOX1 change brush border ROS within colonic crypts at the interface between the epithelium and luminal microbes.",NOX1 loss-of-function genetic variants in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

"BACKGROUND: The traditional focus of residency training programs has been on the development of clinical and surgical skills. The expectation has been that nonclinical skills, including professional development, will be learned in an informal manner rather than through formal teaching. METHODS: After recognizing the absence of formal teaching on professional development in the residency curriculum, we developed a symposium to specifically address this omission. Topics included applying for fellowships, military promotions, overseas assignments, moonlighting, board certification, time management, lifelong orthopaedic learning, and finding a job after the military. Residents were surveyed before and after the symposium to determine the overall usefulness and value of the individual topics. RESULTS: All participating residents reported that they would recommend the symposium to other residents. The course received a mean overall rating of 4.64 (range, 4-5) on a on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 points (excellent). High ratings were received for course usefulness, content, and relevance to future practice. CONCLUSIONS: A formal professional development program to address topics that are relevant to practice and learning should be integrated into an orthopaedic surgery residency curriculum.",Teaching Professional Development to Orthopaedic Residents.
"BACKGROUND: Currant jelly stool is a late manifestation of intussusception and is rarely seen in clinical practice. Other forms of GI bleeding have not been thoroughly studied and little is known about their respective diagnostic values. OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive value of GI bleeding (positive guaiac test, bloody stool and rectal bleeding in evaluation of intussusception. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study cohort of all children, ages 1month-6years of age, who had an abdominal ultrasound obtained evaluating for intussusception over 5year period. We identified intussusception if diagnosed by ultrasound, air-contrast enema or surgery. Univariate and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: During the study period 1258 cases met the study criteria; median age was 1.7years (IQR 0.8, 2.9) and 37% were females. Overall 176 children had intussusception; 153 (87%) were ileo-colic and 23 were ileo-ileal. Univariate risk ratio and adjusted Odds ratio were 1.3 (95% CI, 0.8, 2.0) and 1.3 (0.7, 2.4) for positive guaiac test, 1.1 (0.6, 2.1) and 0.9 (0.3, 3.0) for bloody stool, and 1.7 (1.02, 2.8) and 1.3 (0.5, 3.1) for rectal bleeding . CONCLUSION: Blood in stool, whether visible or tested by guaiac test has poor diagnostic performance in the evaluation of intussusception and is not independently predictive of intussusception. If the sole purpose of a rectal exam in these patients is for guaiac testing it should be reconsidered.",Positive guaiac and bloody stool are poor predictors of intussusception.

"Targeted therapies have revolutionized cancer care, but the development of resistance remains a challenge in the clinic. To identify rational targets for combination strategies, we used an established melanoma mouse model and selected for resistant tumors following genetic suppression of NRAS expression. Complete tumor regression was observed in all mice, but 40% of tumors recurred. Analysis of resistant tumors showed that the most common mechanism of resistance was overexpression and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Interestingly, the most commonly overexpressed RTK was Met and inhibition of Met overcame NRAS resistance in this context. Analysis of NRAS mutant human melanoma cells showed enhanced efficacy of cytotoxicity with combined RTK and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibition. In this study, we establish the importance of adaptive RTK signaling in the escape of NRAS mutant melanoma from inhibition of RAS and provide the rationale for combined blockade of RAS and RTK signaling in this context.",Resistance mechanisms to genetic suppression of mutant NRAS in melanoma.

"Many DNA lesions associated with lymphoid malignancies are linked to off-target cleavage by the RAG1/2 recombinase. However, off-target cleavage has mostly been analyzed in the context of DNA repair defects, confounding any mechanistic understanding of cleavage deregulation. We identified a conserved SQ phosphorylation site on RAG2 365 to 366 that is involved in feedback control of RAG cleavage. Mutation of serine 365 to a non-phosphorylatable alanine permits bi-allelic and bi-locus RAG-mediated breaks in the same cell, leading to reciprocal translocations. This phenomenon is analogous to the phenotype we described for ATM kinase inactivation. Here, we establish deregulated cleavage itself as a driver of chromosomal instability without the associated repair defect. Intriguingly, a RAG2-S365E phosphomimetic rescues the deregulated cleavage of ATM inactivation, reducing the incidence of reciprocal translocations. These data support a model in which feedback control of cleavage and maintenance of genome stability involves ATM-mediated phosphorylation of RAG2.",The Conserved ATM Kinase RAG2-S365 Phosphorylation Site Limits Cleavage Events in Individual Cells Independent of Any Repair Defect.
"Declining national rates of current tobacco use to an all-time low of 15.1% represents a public health victory. Undermining this progress, however, are smoking rates of up to 50% among high-risk, low-income populations. Current FDA-approved treatments for nicotine dependence are ineffective with between 70-95% of treatment-seekers relapsing within the first year of attempted abstinence. Thus, identification of novel intervention targets to optimize response to currently available treatments for nicotine dependence is a critical next step. One such target may be sleep insomnia. Insomnia is a clinically verified nicotine withdrawal symptom but, to date, addressing insomnia or other sleep disturbance symptoms as an adjunctive smoking cessation therapy has yet to be fully considered. To this end, this manuscript presents a narrative review of: (1) sleep continuity and architecture in smokers versus nonsmokers; (2) effects of nicotine abstinence on sleep; (3) possible mechanisms linking sleep with smoking cessation outcomes; (4) plausible adjunctive sleep therapies to promote smoking cessation; (5) possible treatments for unhealthy sleep in smokers; and (6) directions for future research. Taken together, this will provide conceptual support for sleep therapy as an adjunctive treatment for smoking cessation. Implications: This narrative literature review presents a comprehensive discussion of the relationship between habitual sleep and cigarette smoking. The extent to which unhealthy sleep in smokers may be a viable intervention target for promoting response to smoking cessation treatment is considered. Ultimately, this review provides conceptual support for sleep therapy as an adjunctive treatment for smoking cessation.",Sleep as a Target for Optimized Response to Smoking Cessation Treatment.
"Several studies exist modeling the Fontan connection to understand its hemodynamic ties to patient outcomes (Chopski in: Experimental and Computational Assessment of Mechanical Circulatory Assistance of a Patient-Specific Fontan Vessel Configuration.

The most patient-accurate of these studies include flexible, patient-specific total cavopulmonary connections. This study improves Fontan hemodynamic modeling by validating Fontan model flexibility against a patient-specific bulk compliance value, and employing real-time phase contrast magnetic resonance flow data. The improved model was employed to acquire velocity field information under breath-held, free-breathing, and exercise conditions to investigate the effect of these conditions on clinically important Fontan hemodynamic metrics including power loss and viscous dissipation rate. The velocity data, obtained by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, was visualized for qualitative three-dimensional flow field comparisons between the conditions. Key hemodynamic metrics were calculated from the velocity data and used to quantitatively compare the flow conditions. The data shows a multi-factorial and extremely patient-specific nature to Fontan hemodynamics.",Using a Novel In Vitro Fontan Model and Condition-Specific Real-Time MRI Data to Examine Hemodynamic Effects of Respiration and Exercise.
"AIMS: To develop a content valid youth-report measure of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) symptoms. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 5 clinicians and 15 youth aged 8-17 with diabetes were conducted to elicit and clarify youth's DPN experiences. A systematic review of existing adult-report DPN symptom measures was conducted to identify item concepts representative of each experience. The concepts were transformed into items that were iteratively revised based on cognitive interviews (n = 13 youth aged 8-17) and readability analyses. RESULTS: Clinician and youth interviews supported a tripartite conceptual framework of youth DPN symptoms: paresthesia, pain, and anesthesia. Forty-eight youth-report items were generated to represent DPN symptoms identified through the semi-structured interviews and a systematic review of 13 symptom questionnaires for adults. Of these, 23 were eliminated and 3 were revised based on cognitive interviews conducted with youth. The remaining 25 items were on average, written at a 3rd grade reading level. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to generate a content valid self-report measure of youth's lived experiences with DPN that uses developmentally appropriate terminology. With further psychometric testing, the measure could be used to advance research on pediatric DPN and enhance clinicians' capacity to identify the condition in childhood.",Development of a youth-report measure of DPN symptoms: Conceptualization and content validation.
"We propose a novel landmark matching based method for aligning multimodal images, which is accomplished uniquely by resolving a linear mapping between different feature modalities. This linear mapping results in a new measurement on similarity of images captured from different modalities. In addition, our method simultaneously solves this linear mapping and the landmark correspondences by minimizing a convex quadratic function. Our method can estimate complex image relationship between different modalities and nonlinear nonrigid spatial transformations even in the presence of heavy noise, as shown in our experiments carried out by using a variety of image modalities.",Multimodal Image Alignment via Linear Mapping between Feature Modalities.
"BACKGROUND: The Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test-Revised (CUDIT-R) is an 8-item measure used to screen for cannabis use disorders (CUD). Despite widespread use of the tool, assessments of the CUDIT-R's validity in subpopulations are limited. OBJECTIVES: The current study tested the structural validity and internal consistency of one of the most widely used screening measures for CUD (i.e., CUDIT-R) among a sample of military veterans who use cannabis for medicinal purposes. METHODS: The present study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the internal consistency and validity of the single-factor structure of the original screener among a sample of veterans who use cannabis for medicinal purposes (n = 90 [90% male]; Mage = 55.31, SD = 15.37). Measures included demographics and the CUDIT-R, obtained from the baseline assessment of an ongoing longitudinal study. RESULTS: The CFA revealed that the single-factor model previously validated in recreational using samples only accounted for 38.34% of total variance in responses on the CUDIT-R (chi(2) = 66.09, df = 28, p < 0.05; RMSEA = 0.06) and demonstrated acceptable but modest internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.73).

"BACKGROUND: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare autoimmune disease associated with a serological antibody to aquaporin-4 (AQP4) detectable in up to 80% of patients. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is one of the most popular methods of testing for anti-AQP4 antibodies that results with a titer in which < 3 Units/ml is negative, 3-5 is borderline and 5+ is positive. The value of the positive titer in predicting long term disease course is currently unknown. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of NMOSD patients from five centers around the world: Baltimore, USA, Philadelphia, USA, Shanghai, China, Berlin, Germany, and Medellin, Columbia, where ELISA titers on anti-AQP4 antibody testing is available. Inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of NMOSD and seropositive anti-AQP4 antibody test with titer = /> 3 Units/ml. Patients were stratified into three groups by titer: 3-30 Units/ml (low), 31-100 Units/ml (medium), and 101+ Units/ml (high). Demographic factors such as age at onset, race, and sex were collected along with clinical features such as annualized relapse rate, duration of disease, location of relapses, and treatment history. RESULTS: A total of 139 NMOSD patients met criteria for inclusion in this study, stratified into three groups by titer: 42 subjects with low titers of 3-30 Units/ml, 30 subjects with medium titers of 31-100 Units/ml and 67 subjects with high titers of 101 or greater ELISA Units/ml. The average age at onset, sex and race distribution were not significantly different among the groups. The number of patients untreated in each group was similar (< 25%) as was the average annualized relapse rate (0.591-0.821 relapses/year). With an average of 10 years follow up, the average disability level was not different among the three titer groups (EDSS range 3.03-3.48). The distribution of lesions, as well as their preventive treatment regimens did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION: Beyond a positive/borderline/negative result, the titer of the anti-AQP4 antibody ELISA assay is not predictive in the disease course for patients with NMOSD. Low titer patients experience the same disease course as medium-titer and high-titer anti-AQP4 antibody patients with NMOSD.",Anti-aquaporin-4 titer is not predictive of disease course in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: A multicenter cohort study.
"INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a common cause of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks necessitating surgical intervention, and grafting of septal, mastoid, or turbinate bone over the defect is increasingly performed to strengthen the repair of the primary defect. However, the postoperative fate of these grafted bone fragments is largely unknown. METHODOLOGY: We performed a retrospective study of patients at the University of Pennsylvania undergoing repair of spontaneous CSF leaks secondary to IIH. Preoperative and postoperative CTs were analyzed to determine the integration status of the transplanted bone. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with IIH and spontaneous CSF leak were analyzed, with a mean postoperative imaging follow-up period of four years. Thirteen patients (93%) had bone present on CT imaging, with 11 of these patients displaying evidence of bone integration. Two patients (14%) had a recurrent CSF leak in the same area, including the patient with absence of bone on imaging follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Bone grafts frequently incorporate when used for repair of spontaneous CSF leaks associated with IIH. The rate of incorporation is comparable to bone grafts used for other etiologies of CSF leak, despite the increased pressure on the repair site. Any rigid repair of the leak site should likely be accompanied by treatment of the underlying intracranial hypertension to avoid leak recurrence.",The fate of the bone graft in cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea endoscopic repair for idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a retrospective case series analysis.
"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether survivorship of multiple primary cancers (MPCs) is associated with psychological distress, positive health behaviors, and benefit finding.. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the 2010 Livestrong cross-sectional survey.. SETTING: Online survey.. SAMPLE: 238 MPC survivors and 3,295 single cancer survivors.. METHODS: Chi-square and t tests for group comparisons were used. Multivariate linear regression, adjusted for covariates, was used to determine associations between variables.. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: MPC versus single cancer; psychological distress, health behavior (healthy lifestyle and positive healthcare utilization), and benefit-finding scores.. FINDINGS: Survivors of MPCs (compared to single cancer survivors) were significantly older, less likely to have a spouse or partner, further out from original cancer diagnosis, and less likely to be employed full-time, and they differed by cancer diagnoses and survivorship stage. Having MPCs was associated with significantly higher psychological distress and healthcare utilization but not healthy lifestyle or benefit finding.. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to those with single cancers, MPC survivors are at increased risk for psychological distress and are more likely to receive recommended cancer screenings. Additional research is needed to understand mechanisms surrounding psychological distress in MPC survivors.. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Targeted distress screening in MPC survivors may allow for early identification and interventions to ameliorate distress and reduce negative downstream health effects.","Psychological Distress, Health Behaviors, and Benefit Finding in Survivors of Multiple Primary Cancers: Results From the 2010 Livestrong Survey."
"There is substantial evidence that early growth response-1 (Egr1) gene, a zinc-finger transcription factor, behaves as a tumor suppressor in leukemia. This includes reports from this laboratory that constitutive Egr1 overrides leukemia conferred by deregulated c-Myc or E2F-1 in the M1 myeloid leukemic cell line by promoting differentiation. To investigate the effect of Egr1 on the initiation and progression of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), lethally irradiated syngeneic wild type mice were reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) from either wild type or Egr1 null mice transduced with a 210-kD BCR-ABL-expressing MSCV-retrovirus (bone marrow transplantation {BMT}). Loss of Egr1 was observed to accelerate the development of BCR-ABL driven leukemia in recipient mice, resulting in the development of a more aggressive disease, a significantly shortened median survival time, and increased BCR-ABL expressing leukemic stem/progenitor cells (GFP+Lin-cKit+Sca+). Egr1 deficient progenitors expressing BCR-ABL exhibited decreased apoptosis, and increased cell viability and proliferation relative to WT counterparts. Secondary BMT of BCR-ABL BM revealed that loss of Egr1 resulted in enrichment of LSCs, consistent with shorter survival time and more aggressive disease of these mice compared to WT counterparts. Furthermore, serial re-plating colony assays indicated that loss of Egr1 increased self-renewal ability of BCR-ABL expressing BM. These novel findings on the tumor suppressor role of Egr1 in CML provide the impetus to study the effect of altering Egr1 expression in AML, where the overall five year survival rate remains low. The effect of loss of Egr1 in CML could reflect its established functions in normal hematopoiesis, maintaining quiescence of HSCs and driving terminal differentiation to the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Gain of function studies should validate these conclusions and provide further rationale for increased Egr1 as a therapeutic target in AML.","Loss of Egr1, a human del5q gene, accelerates BCR-ABL driven chronic myelogenous leukemia."

"BACKGROUND: Medial epicondyle fractures are a common pediatric and adolescent injury accounting for 11% to 20% of elbow fractures in this population. This purpose of this study was to determine the variability among pediatric orthopaedic surgeons when treating pediatric medial epicondyle fractures. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted to determine which patient and injury attributes influence the management of medial epicondyle fractures by pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. A convenience sample of 13 pediatric orthopaedic surgeons reviewed 60 case vignettes of medial epicondyle fractures that included elbow radiographs and patient/injury characteristics. Displacement was incorporated into the study model as a fixed effect. Surgeons were queried if they would treat the injury with immobilization alone or open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Statistical analysis was performed using a mixed effect regression model. In addition, surgeons filled out a demographic questionnaire and a risk assessment to determine if these factors affected clinical decision-making. RESULTS: Elbow dislocation and fracture displacement were the only attributes that significantly influenced surgeons to perform surgery (P<0.05). The presence of an elbow dislocation had the largest impact on surgeons when choosing operative care (beta=-0.14; P=0.02). In addition, for every 1 mm increase in displacement, surgeons tended to favor ORIF by a factor of 0.09 (P<0.01). Sex, mechanism of injury, and sport participation did not influence decision-making. In total, 54% of the surgeons demonstrated a preference for ORIF for the included scenarios. On the basis of the personality Likert scale, participants were neither high-risk takers nor extremely risk adverse with an average-risk score of 2.24. Participant demographics did not influence decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variation among pediatric orthopaedic surgeons when treating medial epicondyle fractures. The decision to operate is significantly based on the degree of fracture displacement and if there is a concomitant elbow dislocation. There is no standardization regarding how to treat medial epicondyle fractures and better treatment algorithms are needed to provide better patient outcomes.

"PurposeHearing loss is more prevalent in the Saudi Arabian population than in other populations; however, the full range of genetic etiologies in this population is unknown. We report the genetic findings from 33 Saudi hearing-loss probands of tribal ancestry, with predominantly prelingual severe to profound hearing loss.MethodsTesting was performed over the course of 2012-2016, and involved initial GJB2 sequence and GJB6-D13S1830 deletion screening, with negative cases being reflexed to a next-generation sequencing panel with 70, 71, or 87 hearing-loss genes.ResultsA ""positive"" result was reached in 63% of probands, with two recurrent OTOF variants (p.Glu57* and p.Arg1792His) accountable for a third of all ""positive"" cases. The next most common cause was pathogenic variants in MYO7A and SLC26A4, each responsible for three ""positive"" cases. Interestingly, only one ""positive"" diagnosis had a DFNB1-related cause, due to a homozygous GJB6-D13S1830 deletion, and no sequence variants in GJB2 were detected.ConclusionOur findings implicate OTOF as a potential major contributor to hearing loss in the Saudi population, while highlighting the low contribution of GJB2, thus offering important considerations for clinical testing strategies for Saudi patients. Further screening of Saudi patients is needed to characterize the genetic spectrum in this population.",Recurrent variants in OTOF are significant contributors to prelingual nonsydromic hearing loss in Saudi patients.
"BACKGROUND: To develop and test a decision aid for counseling parents of children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).Local problem:Parental education about complex conditions is not standardized and communication and understanding may not be adequate. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 neonatal clinicians and 12 parents of children with BPD using a qualitative research design. The interviews were used to identify education topics that were felt to be important in BPD education. These topics were then used to create a visual decision aid to be used in counseling sessions with parents. The decision aid was then used in mock counseling sessions with 15 'experienced' participants and 7 'naive' participants to assess its efficacy. The participants completed a pre and post test to assess change in knowledge as well as an 11-question Likert style acceptability survey. INTERVENTION: Implementation of a decision aid while educating parents about BPD. RESULTS: Topics identified during the interviews were used to create eight educational cards which included pictures, pictographs and statistics. Overall, participants thought the decision aid contained an appropriate amount of information, were easy to understand and improved their knowledge about BPD. Testing demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge in both the 'experienced' (P<0.0001) and 'naive' group (P=0.0064). CONCLUSION: A decision aid for parents of children with BPD may improve understanding of the condition and help facilitate communication between parents and doctors.",Constructing a relevant decision aid for parents of children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if the pattern of monthly medical expense can be used to identify individuals at risk of dying, thus supporting providers in proactively engaging in advanced care planning discussions. BACKGROUND: Identifying the right time to discuss end of life can be difficult. Improved predictive capacity has made it possible for nurse leaders to use large data sets to guide clinical decision making. METHODS: We examined the patterns of monthly medical expense of Medicare beneficiaries with life-limiting illness during the last 24 months of life using analysis of variance, t tests, and stepwise hierarchical linear modeling. RESULTS: In the final year of life, monthly medical expense increases rapidly for all disease groupings and forms distinct patterns of change. CONCLUSION: Type of condition can be used to classify decedents into distinctly different cost trajectories. Conditions including chronic disease, system failure, or cancer may be used to identify patients who may benefit from supportive care.",Complexity of Chronic Conditions' Impact on End-of-Life Expense Trajectories of Medicare Decedents.
"PURPOSE: To explore how students use and benefit from virtual patient cases (VPCs). METHOD: In academic years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, cohorts of students in pediatrics (Peds), family medicine (FM), and internal medicine (IM) clerkships were allocated to either core required use (CRU) or self-directed use (SU) of MedU VPCs. Outcomes included number and time of case review, student perception of learning from VPCs, National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) subject examination scores, and summative clinical ratings for medical knowledge and differential diagnoses/problem solving. Focus groups were conducted each year. Mean differences were compared by t test. RESULTS: A total of 255 students participated in the study. Mean number of cases completed by the CRU group was significantly higher than that by the SU group (13.9 vs. 3.1 for FM, 16.1 vs. 3.9 for Peds, and 10.4 vs. 1.2 for IM) (P < .001). Student-perceived value ratings of VPCs were similar between groups. Students described VPCs as time consuming but useful for supplementing clinical conditions not seen in person. Mean scores on NBME subject examinations for CRU versus SU groups were not different between groups in any clerkship, nor were there significant differences in the summative clinical ratings for medical knowledge or differential diagnosis/clinical reasoning. CONCLUSIONS: Although VPCs continue to serve an important role in exposing students to clinical conditions not seen in person, the optimal employment of this technology in clerkship pedagogy requires further exploration.",Impact of Required Versus Self-Directed Use of Virtual Patient Cases on Clerkship Performance: A Mixed-Methods Study.
"GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors, of which there are two types, are involved in inhibitory synapses within the central nervous system. The GABAA receptor (GABAAR) has a central role in modern anesthesia and sedation practice, which is evident from the high proportion of agents that target the GABAAR. Many GABAAR agonists are used in anesthesia practice and sedation, including propofol, etomidate, methohexital, thiopental, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane. There are advantages and disadvantages to each GABAAR agonist currently in clinical use. With increasing knowledge regarding the pharmacology of GABAAR agonists, however, newer sedative agents have been developed which employ 'soft pharmacology', a term used to describe the pharmacology of agents whereby their chemical configuration allows rapid metabolism into inactive metabolites after the desired therapeutic effect(s) has occurred. These newer 'soft' GABAAR agonists may well approach ideal sedative agents, as they can offer well-controlled, titratable activity and ultrashort action. This review provides an overview of the role that GABAAR agonists currently play in sedation and anesthesia, in addition to discussing the future role of novel GABAAR agonists in anesthesia and sedation.",The Role of GABA Receptor Agonists in Anesthesia and Sedation.
"BACKGROUND: Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) has been associated with increased risk of hip and other fractures, but the linking mechanisms remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and bone loss. METHODS: Individual participant data analysis was performed after a systematic literature search in MEDLINE/EMBASE (1946-2016). Two reviewers independently screened and selected prospective cohorts providing baseline thyroid status and serial bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. We classified thyroid status as euthyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] 0.45-4.49 mIU/L), SHyper (TSH < 0.45 mIU/L) and subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo, TSH >/= 4.50-19.99 mIU/L) both with normal free thyroxine levels. Our primary outcome was annualized percentage BMD change (%DeltaBMD) from serial dual X-ray absorptiometry scans of the femoral neck, total hip and lumbar spine, obtained from multivariable regression in a random-effects two-step approach. RESULTS: Amongst 5458 individuals (median age 72 years, 49.1% women) from six prospective cohorts, 451 (8.3%) had SHypo and 284 (5.2%) had SHyper. During 36 569 person-years of follow-up, those with SHyper had a greater annual bone loss at the femoral neck versus euthyroidism: %DeltaBMD = -0.18 (95% CI: -0.34, -0.02; I(2) = 0%), with a nonstatistically significant pattern at the total hip: %DeltaBMD = -0.14 (95% CI: -0.38, 0.10; I(2) = 53%), but not at the lumbar spine: %DeltaBMD = 0.03 (95% CI: -0.30, 0.36; I(2) = 25%); especially participants with TSH < 0.10 mIU/L showed an increased bone loss in the femoral neck (%Delta BMD = -0.59; [95% CI: -0.99, -0.19]) and total hip region (%DeltaBMD = -0.46 [95% CI: -1.05, -0.13]). In contrast, SHypo was not associated with bone loss at any site. CONCLUSION: Amongst adults, SHyper was associated with increased femoral neck bone loss, potentially contributing to the increased fracture risk.",Association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and change in bone mineral density in prospective cohorts.
"To examine changes in anti-JC Virus (JCV) index measurements over time in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients to better understand this test, which is used in assessing risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with natalizumab. We aim to describe and compare seroconversion rates, variability of JCV antibody index values, and changes in index values over time between patients on natalizumab therapy and patients naive to natalizumab. Anti-JCV index values are used to help decide whether to start, continue, or stop treatment. Assessing how index values vary over time is interpreted to allow a patient's risk of PML to be better characterized. Retrospective analysis was conducted using records of patients with multiple JCV antibody index measurements exposed to therapy with natalizumab (N = 150) or not (N = 145). Rates of seroconversion, variability of indices, and changes in index values over time were calculated and compared. Patients on natalizumab who were initially JCV antibody negative seroconverted at a significantly higher rate than patients naive to natalizumab (23.9 vs. 9.1%, p < 0.01). Variability of anti-JCV indices was also found to be significantly higher for patients on natalizumab (p < 0.05). Patients on natalizumab additionally trended towards a larger increase in index values over time. Therapy with natalizumab was associated with higher rates of seroconversion and greater anti-JCV index variability, suggesting that therapy with natalizumab may influence this test used to assess risk of treatment with it.",Natalizumab therapy is associated with changes in serum JC virus antibody indices over time.
"BACKGROUND: Poor motivation to engage in goal-oriented behavior has been recognized as a hallmark feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ). Low drive in SZ may be related to anticipating rewards as well as to poor working memory. However, few studies to date have examined beliefs about self-efficacy and satisfaction for future rewards (anticipatory pleasure). Additionally, few studies to date have examined how these deficits may impact SZ patients' real world functioning. METHOD: The present study examined SZ patients' (n=57) anticipatory pleasure, working memory, self-efficacy and real world functioning in relation to their negative symptom severity. RESULTS: Results revealed that SZ patients' negative symptom severity was related to decisions in effort allocation and reward probability, working memory deficits, self-efficacy and anticipatory pleasure for future reward. Effort allocation deficits also predicted patients' daily functioning skills. CONCLUSIONS: SZ patients with high levels of negative symptoms are not merely effort averse, but have more difficulty effectively allocating effort and anticipating pleasure engaging in effortful activities. It may be the case that continuously failing to achieve reinforcement from engagement and participation may lead SZ patients to form certain negative beliefs about their abilities which contributes to amotivation and cognitive deficits. Lastly, our findings provide further support for a link between SZ patients functional daily living skills their effort allocation.",Allocating effort and anticipating pleasure in schizophrenia: Relationship with real world functioning.

"Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.",Genetic effects on gene expression across human tissues.
"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test whether implementing a guideline for nonemergent intubation improves the rate of premedication for nonemergent intubations in an academic level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We further sought to test the hypothesis that neonates who receive premedication for a nonemergent intubation have decreased pain scores at the time of intubation, fewer intubation attempts, and no associated adverse events. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study with ongoing audit and feedback as well as statistical process control analysis. Data collection began on October 1, 2014. Clinical guideline implementation began in October 2015. A percent ""P""-chart spanning seven-quarters was constructed with statistical process control analysis plotting premedication rates over time. Student's t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The mean number of nonemergent intubations given premedications increased from 34 to 82%. The mean pain score was lower when premedications were given: 0.34 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10-0.58) versus 2.8 (95% CI: 1.9-3.6) (p < 0.001). The number of intubation attempts did not differ with premedications. CONCLUSION: Adopting a guideline with supporting educational initiatives to standardize premedication before nonemergent intubations increased this practice. This regimen lowered clinical pain scores with no difference in the number of intubation attempts.",Transition to Routine Premedication for Nonemergent Intubations in a Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
"BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a well-recognized phenomenon in adult trauma populations. The ""initial hit"" of the traumatic event is often coupled with a systemic immune response characterized by changes in vital signs and laboratory indicators. A ""second hit"" from surgery during this time frame often results in acute lung injury, along with deterioration of the patient's clinical condition. We hypothesized that children and adolescents would experience SIRS physiology, but would not experience adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ""second hit"" related death to the extent seen in the adult populations. METHODS: We queried the trauma database of our level 1 pediatric trauma center from January 2005 to December 2015 for patients with injury severity scores of >16. We used the electronic medical record to track SIRS criteria in patients days 1 to 4 posttrauma. Trends were examined in patients with an orthopaedic injury (OI) and with no orthopaedic injury. Patients were further subcategorized and analyzed by age group based on the convention for definition of pediatric SIRS. Patients in the orthopaedic cohort were further examined for pulmonary complications and death. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for SIRS physiology in the first 4 days of hospitalization. RESULTS: 81.4% (OI) and 69.1% no orthopaedic injury reached the threshold for SIRS within their first 4 days of hospitalization. Nine patients died in the hospital. Only 3 OI patients developed the criteria for ARDS, and only 3 patients with orthopaedic injuries died, 2 died within 24 hours of presentation and 1 within 48 hours, all had severe brain trauma. Increasing age groups showed increasing proportion of patients with SIRS. Increasing injury severity score and increasing age were independent predictors of SIRS during days 1 to 4. DISCUSSION: SIRS seems to be as common in children as the reported rates for adults, and the proportion of SIRS in children increases with increasing age and injury severity. The high mortality rate and rate of ARDS observed in adults was not observed in our cohort. The presence or absence of major orthopaedic injuries was not a significant predictor. The SIRS response in polytraumatized children is poorly understood. The clinical phenomenon of acute lung injury/ARDS is observed less often in children, but the exact mechanism by which this occurs is unknown.

"Direct electrophilic fluorination using molecular fluorine gas is used in organic synthesis to create novel fluorine-containing compounds with potential beneficial activity that could not be obtained by nucleophilic substitution. In this paper, we report a novel electrophilic substitution of bromine by fluorine in an aromatic system. The mechanism of this type of fluorination was explored using the reaction between bromothymolsulfonphthalein (Bromothymol Blue) and dilute fluorine gas under acidic conditions. Substitution occurs in the bromine atoms located in the ortho-position relative to the hydroxyl group. A similar electrophilic fluorination of thymolsulfonphthalein (Thymol Blue) leads to a substitution of hydrogen atoms in the same position (ortho to hydroxyl). NMR spectroscopy was used to confirm the fluorination sites. NMR spectra of thymolsulfonphthalein and its derivatives under basic conditions can be explained by considering the absence of resonance between the two phenolic rings. Both dibromothymol blue and fluorobromothymol blue revealed intermolecular attenuate Cerenkov radiation selectively near their maximum absorbance in a pH dependent manner.",Synthesis of pH indicators for Cerenkov imaging by electrophilic substitution of bromine by fluorine in an aromatic system.

"Although juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP) generally involves a benign tumor on the larynx and other respiratory tract areas, almost all patients with this disease require repeated surgical intervention (to prevent airway obstruction during the course of illness) and various adjuvant therapies such as interferon, cidofovir, acyclovir, ribavirin, indole-3-carbinol, HspE7, mumps vaccine, photodynamic therapy, propranolol, cimetidine, and bevacizumab. Some case reports recently described the effectiveness of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4) as an adjuvant therapy. On the basis of these reports, we administered HPV4 to a 2-year-old boy with JoRRP. However, no therapeutic effect was found. A review of the available literature revealed that current evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic HPV4 and other adjuvant therapies for JoRRP is inconsistent. Therefore, the prophylactic use of currently available HPV vaccine for adolescents is the most effective strategy for preventing not only anogenital cancers but also genital warts, which might be a risk factor for JoRRP among their children in the future.",Treatment With Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine for Juvenile-Onset Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis: Case Report and Review of the Literature.
"MEK1/2 and BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are used to treat BRAF(V600E)-positive melanoma, with other cancers under evaluation. Genetic perturbation of copper import or pharmacologic reduction of copper with the clinical copper chelator TTM inhibits MEK1/2 kinase activity and reduces BRAF(V600E)-driven tumorigenesis. In this study, we report that TTM inhibited transformed growth of melanoma cell lines resistant to BRAF or MEK1/2 inhibitors and enhanced the antineoplastic activity of these inhibitors. TTM also provided a survival advantage in a genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma, and when accounting for putative overdosing, trended toward an increase in the survival benefit afforded by BRAF inhibition. This effect was phenocopied by genetically inhibiting copper import in tumors, which was linked to a reduction in MAPK signaling. Thus, TTM reduces copper levels and MAPK signaling, thereby inhibiting BRAF(V600E)-driven melanoma tumor growth. These observations inform and support clinical evaluation of TTM in melanoma.

"Marginal structural models are a class of causal models useful for characterizing the effect of treatment in the presence of time-varying confounding. They are more widely used than structural nested models, partly because these models are easier to understand and to implement. We extend marginal structural models to situations with clustered observations with unit- and cluster-level treatment and introduce an appropriate inferential method. We consider how to formulate models with cluster-level and unit-level treatments. For unit-level treatments, we consider cases with and without interference. We also consider the use of unit-specific inverse probability weights and certain working correlation structures to improve the efficiency of estimators in some situations. We apply our method to different scenarios including 2 or 3 units per cluster and a mixture of larger clusters. Simulation examples and data from the treatment arm of a glaucoma clinical trial were used to illustrate our method.",Marginal structural models to estimate the effects of time-varying treatments on clustered outcomes in the presence of interference.
"OBJECTIVES: Compared with normal fetuses, fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) have smaller brain volumes and are at higher risk of brain injury, possibly due to diminished cerebral blood flow and oxygen content. By increasing cerebral oxygen delivery, maternal hyperoxygenation (MH) might improve brain development and reduce the risk of brain injury in these fetuses. This study investigated whether gestational age and baseline cerebrovascular resistance affect the response to MH in fetuses with HLHS. METHODS: The study population comprised 43 fetuses with HLHS or HLHS variant referred for fetal echocardiography between January 2004 and September 2008. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) pulsatility index (PI), a surrogate measure of cerebrovascular resistance, was assessed between 20 and 41 weeks' gestation at baseline in room air (RA) and after 10 min of MH. Z-scores of MCA-PI were generated. A mixed-effects model was used to determine whether change in MCA-PI depends upon gestational age and baseline MCA-PI. RESULTS: In RA and following MH, MCA-PI demonstrated a curvilinear relationship with gestational age in fetuses with HLHS, peaking at around 28 weeks and then falling more steeply near term. MCA-PI Z-score declined in a linear manner, such that it was 1.4 SD below that in normal fetuses at 38 weeks. Increase in MCA-PI Z-score after MH was first seen at >/= 28 weeks. A baseline MCA-PI Z-score </= -0.96 was predictive of an increase in cerebrovascular resistance in response to MH. CONCLUSION: In fetuses with HLHS, MCA-PI first increases in response to MH at >/= 28 weeks' gestation. A baseline MCA-PI Z-score </= -0.96 predicts an increase in cerebrovascular resistance in response to MH. These results may have implications for clinical trials utilizing MH as a neuroprotective agent. Copyright (c) 2017 ISUOG.

"Cytokine storm syndromes are a clinically heterogeneous group of conditions resulting from a maladaptive host response to an inflammatory trigger. These syndromes lead to rapid progression of immune-mediated damage to healthy tissues resulting in life-threatening multi-system organ failure. Prompt recognition of disease and medical intervention to limit damage to healthy tissues is essential to prevent cytokine storm morbidity and mortality. However, the diagnosis of cytokine storm syndromes is challenging, given the clinical heterogeneity in disease presentations. Therefore, expeditious and readily available tests to diagnose disease and differentiate between the various types of cytokine storm syndromes are of clinical utility.

"The objective of this study is to investigate the role of Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) in Cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced mice muscle inflammation. CTX injection i.m. was performed to induce B6 mice acute tibialis anterior (TA) muscle injury. The mice were then injected i.p. with the recombinant CaMKIV protein or its antagonist KN-93. Immunoblotting was used to assess Calmodulin (CaM) and CaMKIV levels. Immunofluorescence was used to detect intramuscular infiltration or major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I expression in damaged muscle. The extent of infiltration was evaluated by fluorescent intensity analysis. Cytokines/chemokines levels were determined by qPCR. CaMKIV gene knockdown in C2C12 cells was performed in order to evaluate the effects of CaMKIV on immuno-behavior of muscle cells. CTX administration induced a strong up-regulation of CaM and p-CaMKIV levels in infiltrated mononuclear cells and regenerated myofibers. In vivo adding of the recombinant CaMKIV protein enhanced intramuscular infiltration of monocytes/macrophages in damaged muscle and increased the number of proinflammatory Ly-6C(+)F4/80(+) macrophage cells. CaMKIV protein treatment induced a striking up-regulation of mRNA levels of IL-1, IL-6, MCP-1, and MCP-3 in CD45(+) cells sorted from damaged muscle; increased the infiltration of CD8(+) T cells; and induced the up-regulation of MHC-I in partial regenerated myofibers, which was rarely observed in muscle damage alone. Additionally, CaMKIV protein treatment diminished the regulatory T cells (Tregs) number and led to the damaged TA muscle repair delay. In vitro CaMKIV gene knockdown reversed IFN-gamma-induced up-regulation of MHC-I/II and TLR3 in the differentiated C2C12 myotubes.

"Many regulated epigenetic elements and base lesions found in genomic DNA can both directly impact gene expression and play a role in disease processes. However, due to their noncanonical nature, they are challenging to assess with conventional technologies. Here, we present a new approach for the targeted detection of diverse modified bases in DNA. We first use enzymatic components of the DNA base excision repair pathway to install an individual affinity label at each location of a selected modified base with high yield. We then probe the resulting material with a solid-state nanopore assay capable of discriminating labeled DNA from unlabeled DNA. The technique features exceptional modularity via selection of targeting enzymes, which we establish through the detection of four DNA base elements: uracil, 8-oxoguanine, T:G mismatch, and the methyladenine analog 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine. Our results demonstrate the potential for a quantitative nanopore assessment of a broad range of base modifications.",Solid-State Nanopore Analysis of Diverse DNA Base Modifications Using a Modular Enzymatic Labeling Process.

"BACKGROUND: Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) is a chelating agent used for the treatment of hyperkalemia. SPS has a wide range of exchange capacity requiring close monitoring of serum electrolytes. We observed two patients who developed acute hypocalcemia and increased metabolic alkalosis after initiating SPS therapy. We report these cases to draw attention to the potential risk of this medication in pediatric patients. CASE DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: Two children with chronic kidney disease on dialysis were started on SPS for hyperkalemia. Within a week after initiation of the medication, both patients developed hypocalcemia on routine labs without overt clinical manifestations. The hypocalcemia was rapidly corrected with oral supplementation and discontinuation of SPS. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypocalcemia can develop after SPS therapy. The metabolic alkalosis in these patients associated with the hypocalcemia put them at increased risk for complications. Hence, careful attention must be paid to the state of calcium metabolism in all patients receiving SPS. Often calcium supplementation is required to maintain normal calcium levels.",Acute Hypocalcemia and Metabolic Alkalosis in Children on Cation-Exchange Resin Therapy.

"Acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) secondary to emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) has an extremely poor natural history, with a reported mortality rate up to 95%.

We report our initial multi-institutional experience using primary radial access in the treatment of acute BAO in nine consecutive cases. Technical success defined as a TICI score of 2B or 3 was achieved in 89% of cases. Average puncture to revascularization time was 35.8 minutes.

The power of the immune system to fight hematologic malignancies is seen in allogeneic stem cell transplant, where donor T cells attack residual malignant cells in the recipient. Now, three innovative therapeutic immunotherapy classes (I) adoptive cellular therapy; (II) immune-checkpoint inhibitors; and (III) novel antibody therapies show promising results in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Genetically engineered T cells, CAR T cells, obtained remissions in lymphomas refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab revolutionized the treatment of many solid tumors, and unprecedented results are now reported in relapsed/refractory lymphoma. Building on the success of rituximab, additional therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed for lymphoma treatment. Antibodies have recently been further engineered with multiple binding sites to directly engage both tumor and T cells. There are exciting early clinical trial results for the first bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE), blinatumomab, as well as promising ongoing studies for dual antibody molecules, Dual-Affinity Re-Targeting (DART) proteins. This review highlights these three immunotherapy classes for relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas and discusses the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, and toxicities of each.",The role of novel immunotherapies in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
"How transcription factors (TFs) reprogram one cell lineage to another remains unclear. Here, we define chromatin accessibility changes induced by the proneural TF Ascl1 throughout conversion of fibroblasts into induced neuronal (iN) cells. Thousands of genomic loci are affected as early as 12 hr after Ascl1 induction. Surprisingly, over 80% of the accessibility changes occur between days 2 and 5 of the 3-week reprogramming process. This chromatin switch coincides with robust activation of endogenous neuronal TFs and nucleosome phasing of neuronal promoters and enhancers. Subsequent morphological and functional maturation of iN cells is accomplished with relatively little chromatin reconfiguration. By integrating chromatin accessibility and transcriptome changes, we built a network model of dynamic TF regulation during iN cell reprogramming and identified Zfp238, Sox8, and Dlx3 as key TFs downstream of Ascl1. These results reveal a singular, coordinated epigenomic switch during direct reprogramming, in contrast to stepwise cell fate transitions in development.",Rapid Chromatin Switch in the Direct Reprogramming of Fibroblasts to Neurons.
"An international survey was conducted to provide insights into current practices related to vocal health among amateur and professional voice users. Vocalists of various genres completed an online survey related to their practice in seeking medical care for vocal health concerns, and their preferences for the type of medical help they seek. Specific vocal symptoms or conditions which the subjects feel would warrant evaluation was also queried, as well as their preference for voice use and management should laryngeal pathology be diagnosed during a medical examination. Participants were knowledgeable in both traditional and alternative medical approaches but showed a preference for those options most readily available, as opposed to those best suited for a vocal issue. Ideally, a combination of traditional and alternative management would appear to be the best long-term strategy for professional and amateur voice users.",A Vocal Health Survey Among Amateur and Professional Voice Users.
"The recent passage of state youth sports concussion laws across the country introduces clinical implications for health care professionals caring for student-athletes. Although the laws were established to provide protections for student-athletes and prevent adverse outcomes, efforts aimed at implementation have uncovered various challenges in concussion diagnosis and management. Some of the most salient issues include medical evaluation, return to play, and return to learn. For this reason, health care professionals play a pivotal role in determining the critical next steps after a student is removed from play with a suspected concussion. Also, state laws may influence an influx of concussion patients to health care facilities and, thereby, present various unforeseen challenges that can be mitigated with adequate clinical preparation. This is key to helping student-athletes recover and resume regular activities in sports, recreation, and education. This review describes the various components of state youth sports concussion laws relevant to clinical practice and nuances that health care professionals should appreciate in this context. Additionally, concussion tools and strategies that can be used in clinical practice are discussed.",The Clinical Implications of Youth Sports Concussion Laws: A Review.
"The insulin-regulated glucose transporter, GluT4, is a key molecule in peripheral insulin signaling. Although GluT4 is abundantly expressed in neurons of specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, the functional role of neuronal GluT4 is unclear. Here, we used pharmacological inhibition of GluT4-mediated glucose uptake to determine whether GluT4 mediates insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the hippocampus. Consistent with previous reports, we found that glucose utilization increased in the dorsal hippocampus of male rats during spontaneous alternation (SA), a hippocampally-mediated spatial working memory task. We previously showed that insulin signaling within the hippocampus is required for processing this task, and that administration of exogenous insulin enhances performance. At baseline levels of hippocampal insulin, inhibition of GluT4-mediated glucose uptake did not affect SA performance. However, inhibition of an upstream regulator of GluT4, Akt, did impair SA performance. Conversely, when a memory-enhancing dose of insulin was delivered to the hippocampus prior to SA-testing, inhibition of GluT4-mediated glucose transport prevented cognitive enhancement. These data suggest that baseline hippocampal cognitive processing does not require functional hippocampal GluT4, but that cognitive enhancement by supra-baseline insulin does. Consistent with these findings, we found that in neuronal cell culture, insulin increases glucose utilization in a GluT4-dependent manner. Collectively, these data demonstrate a key role for GluT4 in transducing the procognitive effects of elevated hippocampal insulin.",Insulin modulates hippocampally-mediated spatial working memory via glucose transporter-4.

"OBJECTIVE: To determine if pessary use prevents preterm birth (PTB) in women with singleton pregnancy, with short cervical length (CL) measured on transvaginal sonography (TVS) and without prior spontaneous PTB (sPTB). METHODS: This was an open-label multicenter randomized trial of asymptomatic women presenting at 18 + 0 to 23 + 6 weeks' gestation with a singleton pregnancy, CL </= 25 mm on TVS and no prior sPTB. sPTB included those with spontaneous onset of labor and those with rupture of membranes prior to labor. Subjects were randomized to receive either a Bioteque cup pessary or no pessary. Pessaries were inserted by trained maternal-fetal medicine staff. Vaginal progesterone was recommended to women with CL </= 20 mm. The primary outcome was PTB < 37 weeks. A sample size of 121 women in each group (n = 242) was needed to detect a reduction in the primary outcome from 30% in the no-pessary group to 15% in the pessary group. The trial was stopped early before complete enrollment. RESULTS: Between 17 March 2014 and 29 July 2016, 17 383 women underwent CL measurement on TVS. Of these, 422 (2.4%) had CL </= 25 mm and 391 (92.7%) met the full eligibility criteria, of which 122 (31.2%) agreed to randomization. Sixty-one (50%) women were randomized to the pessary group and 61 (50%) to the no-pessary group. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. There were no significant differences between the pessary and no-pessary groups in the rate of PTB < 37 weeks (43% vs 40%; relative risk 1.09; 95% CI, 0.71-1.68) or in secondary outcomes, such as rate of PTB < 34 weeks, rate of PTB < 28 weeks, gestational age at delivery, birth weight and rate of composite adverse neonatal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical pessary use was not associated with prevention of PTB in women with a singleton pregnancy, short CL on TVS and no prior sPTB in this small, underpowered randomized controlled trial.

"Patients with community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CO-MRSA) infections contribute to MRSA contamination of the home environment, and may be re-exposed to MRSA strains from this reservoir. This study evaluates One Health risk factors that focus on the relationship between humans, animals and the environment for increased prevalence of multiple antimicrobial resistant MRSA in the home environment. During a trial of patients with CO-MRSA infection, MRSA was isolated from the household environment at baseline and three months later, following randomization of patients and household members to mupirocin-based decolonization therapy or education control. Up to two environmental MRSA isolates per visit were tested. MRSA isolates were identified in 68% (65/95) of homes at baseline (n=104 isolates) and 51% (33/65) of homes three months later (n=56 isolates). Rates of MDR were 61% at baseline and 55% at the three-month visit. At baseline, 100% (14/14) of MRSA isolates from rural homes were MDR. While antimicrobial use in humans or pets was associated with an increased risk for the isolation of MDR MRSA from the environment, clindamycin use was not associated risk for isolation of MDR MRSA. Two (5%) of 39 homes that were randomized to mupirocin treatment, but none of the control families, had incident low-level mupirocin resistant MRSA isolated at three months. Among patients recently treated for a CO-MRSA infection, MRSA and MDR MRSA were common contaminants in the home environment. This study contributes to evidence that occupant use of antimicrobial drugs--except clindamycin--is associated with MDR MRSA in the home environmental reservoir.Importance: MRSA is a common bacterial agent implicated in skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in both community and healthcare settings. Patients with CO-MRSA infections contribute to MRSA contamination and may be re-exposed to MRSA strains from these reservoirs. People interact with natural and built environments, therefore understanding the relationships between humans and animals as well as characteristics of environmental reservoirs is important to advance strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance. Household interactions may influence the frequency and duration of exposure, which in turn may impact the duration of MRSA colonization or probability for recurrent colonization and infection. Therefore, MRSA contamination of the home environment may contribute to human and animal recolonization and decolonization treatment failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate One Health risk factors that may be amenable to intervention and may influence the recovery of MDR and mupR resistance in CO-MRSA isolates.",Multidrug and mupirocin resistance in environmental methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) collected from the homes of people diagnosed with a community-onset (CO-) MRSA infection.
"Nasal continuous positive airway pressure is used increasingly to treat pulmonary immaturity in premature neonates. Nasal injury is common with nasal continuous positive airway pressure use, with full-thickness tissue loss at the columella among the most devastating complications. Columellar necrosis often imparts a full-thickness injury to the overlying columellar skin, the medial crura of the lower lateral nasal cartilages, the anteromedial inner nasal mucosal lining, and potentially the anterior septal cartilage. Consequently, the columella can become scarred and shortened. Although multiple techniques have been described to reconstruct the columella, no known technique has been specifically developed to treat the unique columellar defect common to severe nasal continuous positive airway pressure injury. Donor-site morbidity related to these techniques, and how growth of the reconstructed nose will proceed, are obvious concerns, especially in young children. The authors present a novel reconstruction technique that uses recreation of the defect with posteriorly based book flaps and auricular chondrocutaneous composite graft interposition. This technique has several advantages, including avoiding central facial scars, supplying well-matched skin color and texture, and facilitating robust tip support. The authors retrospectively review the use and outcomes of this technique from 1995 and 2016 on all patients with a history of nasal continuous positive airway pressure columellar necrosis at their center.",Columellar Reconstruction following Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Injury.

"BACKGROUND: Postpartum contraception is especially important for women who use alcohol and other substances, given the risk of possible rapid repeat pregnancy and prenatal substance exposure. However, little is known about postpartum contraceptive use among women with substance use histories. OBJECTIVE: To characterize postpartum contraceptive initiation, 24-month continuation, and rapid repeat pregnancy among women who used substances during pregnancy. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of 161 pregnant women who enrolled in a randomized clinical trial to treat substance use in pregnancy and completed at least one follow-up assessment. Women were eligible if they were less than 28 weeks gestation and reported alcohol or illicit drug use within the past 30 days. Participants were recruited from two hospital-based OB/GYN clinics between 2006 and 2010, and completed assessments at delivery and 3-, 12-, and 24-months postpartum. RESULTS: Past 30-day use of any substance (not including tobacco) was 52.4%, 58.3%, and 59.8% at 3-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up, respectively. Marijuana was the most commonly reported illicit substance (as high as 48.1%). Rates of any contraceptive use were 71.3%, 66.7% and 65.3% at 3-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up, respectively; DepoProvera and condoms were the most common methods. Rapid repeat pregnancy occurred in 28% of participants by 24-month follow-up. Conclusions/Importance: Postpartum contraceptive use among substance using women was at or near 70%, which is comparable to other samples of postpartum women. Innovative efforts are needed to promote effective contraceptive use among postpartum women in general and among those who use substances in particular.",Postpartum Contraceptive use and Rapid Repeat Pregnancy Among Women who use Substances.
"Assessing the adequacy of oxygen delivery to tissues is vital, particularly in the fields of intensive care medicine and surgery. As oxygen delivery to a cell becomes deficient, changes in mitochondrial redox state precede changes in cellular function. We describe a technique for the continuous monitoring of the mitochondrial redox state on the epicardial surface using resonance Raman spectroscopy. We quantify the reduced fraction of specific electron transport chain cytochromes, a metric we name the resonance Raman reduced mitochondrial ratio (3RMR). As oxygen deficiency worsens, heme moieties within the electron transport chain become progressively more reduced, leading to an increase in 3RMR. Myocardial 3RMR increased from baseline values of 18.1 +/- 5.9 to 44.0 +/- 16.9% (P = 0.0039) after inferior vena cava occlusion in rodents (n = 8). To demonstrate the diagnostic power of this measurement, 3RMR was continuously measured in rodents (n = 31) ventilated with 5 to 8% inspired oxygen for 30 min. A 3RMR value exceeding 40% at 10 min predicted subsequent cardiac arrest with 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity [area under the curve (AUC), 0.98], outperforming all current measures, including contractility (AUC, 0.51) and ejection fraction (AUC, 0.39). 3RMR correlated with indices of intracellular redox state and energy production. This technique may permit the real-time identification of critical defects in organ-specific oxygen delivery.",Responsive monitoring of mitochondrial redox states in heart muscle predicts impending cardiac arrest.
"BACKGROUND: Clinicians in low resource settings in malaria endemic regions face many challenges in diagnosing and treating febrile illnesses in children. Given the change in WHO guidelines in 2010 that recommend malaria testing prior to treatment, clinicians are now required to expand the differential when malaria testing is negative. Prior studies have indicated that resource availability, need for additional training in differentiating non-malarial illnesses, and lack of understanding within the community of when to seek care play a role in effective diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this study was to examine the various factors that influence clinician behavior in diagnosing and managing children presenting with fever to health centres in Kenya. METHODS: A total of 20 clinicians (2 paediatricians, 1 medical officer, 2 nurses, and 15 clinical officers) were interviewed, working at 5 different government-sponsored public clinic sites in two areas of Kenya where malaria is prevalent. Clinicians were interviewed one-on-one using a structured interview technique. Interviews were then analysed qualitatively for themes. RESULTS: The following five themes were identified: (1) Strong familiarity with diagnosis of malaria and testing for malaria; (2) Clinician concerns about community understanding of febrile illness, use of traditional medicine, delay in seeking care, and compliance; (3) Reliance on clinical guidelines, history, and physical examination to diagnose febrile illness and recognize danger signs; (4) Clinician discomfort with diagnosis of primary viral illness leading to increased use of empiric antibiotics; and (5) Lack of resources including diagnostic testing, necessary medications, and training modalities contributes to the difficulty clinicians face in assessing and treating febrile illness in children. These themes persisted across all sites, despite variation in levels of medical care. Within these themes, clinicians consistently expressed a need for reliable basic testing, especially haemograms and bacterial cultures. Clinicians discussed the use of counseling and education to improve community understanding of febrile illness in order to decrease preventable deaths in children. CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that since malarial testing has become more widespread, clinicians working in resource-poor environments still face difficulty when evaluating a child with fever, especially when malaria testing is negative. Improving access to additional diagnostics, continuing medical education, and ongoing evaluation and revision of clinical guidelines may lead to more consistent management of febrile illness by providers, and may potentially decrease prescription of unnecessary antibiotics. Additional interventions at the community level may also have an important role in managing febrile illness, however, more studies are needed to identify targets for intervention at both the clinic and community levels.","Principles, practices and knowledge of clinicians when assessing febrile children: a qualitative study in Kenya."
"Maternal history of thyroid disease can cause congenital hypothyroidism due to thyroid-stimulatng hormone (TSH) blocking antibodies. No guidelines exist regarding testing beyond the newborn screen. TSH and T4 levels exhibit significant fluctuations after birth which complicates testing. A total of 561 newborns with thyroid function testing done for maternal history of thyroid disease in the newborn nursery were identified retrospectively via chart review, and thyroid disease status was assessed in 352. Newborn screening data were also obtained. Of these infants, 7 had hypothyroidism with 3 having negative newborn screens. No cases of neonatal graves were identified. The 3 infants with negative newborn screens had TSH levels ranging from 6.58 to 28.4 prior to treatment with levothyroxine. All required treatment beyond age 3 years, despite trial off levothyroxine. Infants with maternal history of thyroid disease may require additional testing beyond the newborn screen. However, providers can consider delaying test until after thyroid levels are more stable.",Thyroid Function Testing in Neonates With Maternal History of Disease.
"OBJECTIVES: Although pediatric intensivists philosophically embrace lung protective ventilation for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, we hypothesized that ventilator management varies. We assessed ventilator management by evaluating changes to ventilator settings in response to blood gases, pulse oximetry, or end-tidal CO2. We also assessed the potential impact that a pediatric mechanical ventilation protocol adapted from National Heart Lung and Blood Institute acute respiratory distress syndrome network protocols could have on reducing variability by comparing actual changes in ventilator settings to those recommended by the protocol. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Eight tertiary care U.S. PICUs, October 2011 to April 2012. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty patients (age range 17 d to 18 yr) with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two thousand hundred arterial and capillary blood gases, 3,964 oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, and 2,757 end-tidal CO2 values were associated with 3,983 ventilator settings. Ventilation mode at study onset was pressure control 60%, volume control 19%, pressure-regulated volume control 18%, and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation 3%. Clinicians changed FIO2 by +/-5 or +/-10% increments every 8 hours. Positive end-expiratory pressure was limited at ~10 cm H2O as oxygenation worsened, lower than would have been recommended by the protocol. In the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation, maximum tidal volume/kg using predicted versus actual body weight was 10.3 (8.5-12.9) (median [interquartile range]) versus 9.2 mL/kg (7.6-12.0) (p < 0.001). Intensivists made changes similar to protocol recommendations 29% of the time, opposite to the protocol's recommendation 12% of the time and no changes 56% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilator management varies substantially in children with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Opportunities exist to minimize variability and potentially injurious ventilator settings by using a pediatric mechanical ventilation protocol offering adequately explicit instructions for given clinical situations. An accepted protocol could also reduce confounding by mechanical ventilation management in a clinical trial.",Variability in Usual Care Mechanical Ventilation for Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Time for a Decision Support Protocol?

"Some of the most difficult clinical ethics consultations involve patients who have both medical and mental health needs, as these cases can result in considerable moral distress on the part of the bedside staff. In this article we examine the issues that such consults raise through the illustrative example of a particular case: several years ago our ethics consultation service received a request from a critical care attending physician who was considering a rarely performed psychosurgical intervention to address intractable and life-threatening agitation and aggression in an adolescent patient for whom standard treatments had proven unsuccessful. We consider strategies that may be useful in addressing not only the ethical dilemmas or the clinical problems, but also the emotional, social, and moral distress that arise in delivering care in such complex cases, in which standard routine practices of care have been exhausted. In addition, we explore the processes that led to this situation and suggest ways to promote early recognition and intervention for similar cases in the future.",Responding to Moral Distress and Ethical Concerns at the Intersection of Medical Illness and Unmet Mental Health Needs.
"CONTEXT: We have reported previously that DAB389IL-2 recombinant fusion toxin targets IL-2R bearing CD4(+) cells, and suppresses demyelinating disease in acute (A) - and chronic (C) - experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal models of multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVES: The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of DAB389IL-2 treatment on various cytokine-secreting cell populations in A-EAE and C-EAE mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of DAB389IL-2 at doses of 200-, 800-, or 1600 kU administered i.v. on days 11-13 and 15 on the clinical score and cytokine-secreting cell populations were examined using flow cytometry. RESULTS: C-EAE mice treated with 1600kU DAB389IL-2, but not A-EAE mice treated with 800 kU had significantly reduced disease. The CD3+CD25+ sub-population in spleens and spinal cords of A-EAE mice treated with 800 kU DAB389IL-2 a was increased, whereas in C-EAE mice treated with 1600 kU this population was increased. DAB389IL-2 treatment reduced CD3(+)CD4(+), CD3(+)CD8(+), CD4(+)CD8(+), CD3(+)IL-2(+), CD3(+)IFN-gamma(+) and CD3(+)TNF-alpha(+) T cell subpopulations in the spinal cord in A-EAE, and C-EAE mice on day 16. CD11b+ macrophages that were IL-2-, IFN-gamma-, and TNF-alpha- positive were reduced in A-EAE mice. DAB389IL-2 treatment reduced CD19(+) B-cells positive for IL-2 or CD11b(+) in the spinal cord in acute and chronic disease. DAB389IL-2 treatment also reduced lymph node CD3(+)CD8(+), CD4(+)CD8(+), CD3(+)CD25(+) populations on day 16, and lymph node CD3(+)IL-10(+) and peripheral blood CD3(+)CD25(+) populations on day 24.

"OBJECTIVES: To examine issues regarding the granularity (size/scale) and potential acceptability of recommendations in a ventilator management protocol for children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN: Survey/questionnaire. SETTING: The eight PICUs in the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-two physicians (attendings and fellows). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We used an online questionnaire to examine attitudes and assessed recommendations with 50 clinical scenarios. Overall 80% of scenario recommendations were accepted. Acceptance did not vary by provider characteristics but did vary by ventilator mode (high-frequency oscillatory ventilation 83%, pressure-regulated volume control 82%, pressure control 75%; p = 0.002) and variable adjusted (ranging from 88% for peak inspiratory pressure and 86% for FIO2 changes to 69% for positive end-expiratory pressure changes). Acceptance did not vary based on child size/age. There was a preference for smaller positive end-expiratory pressure changes but no clear granularity preference for other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall acceptance rate for scenarios was good, there was little consensus regarding the size/scale of ventilator setting changes for children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. An acceptable protocol could support robust evaluation of ventilator management strategies. Further studies are needed to determine if adherence to an explicit protocol leads to better outcomes.",Potential Acceptability of a Pediatric Ventilator Management Computer Protocol.

Slow-cycling cells were previously identified in melanoma, but not fully biologically characterized. Using the label-retention method, we identified a subpopulation of slow-cycling cells, defined as label-retaining cells (LRC), with strong invasive properties. We demonstrate through live imaging that LRC are leaving the primary tumor mass at a very early stage and disseminate to peripheral organs.

"PURPOSE: The recommended first-line treatment for young children infected with HIV includes the liquid formulation of the co-formulated protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra((R)) [Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, Illinois]). Clinical reports indicate that some children readily accept the taste of Kaletra, whereas others strongly reject it, which can deter therapeutic adherence and outcomes. METHODS: As a proof-of-concept approach, a sensory panel of genotyped adults was used to document the range of individual differences in the taste and palatability (hedonics) of the liquid formulation of Kaletra and other taste stimuli, including common excipients. Panelists rated taste sensations using generalized labeled magnitude scales to determine genotype-phenotype relationships. Several months later, the panelists were retested to assess response reliability. FINDINGS: Not all panelists had the same sensory experience when tasting Kaletra. Palatability ratings varied widely, from moderate like to strongest imaginable dislike, and were reliable over time. The more irritating and bitter Kaletra tasted, the more disliked by the panelist. The more they disliked the taste of Kaletra, the more they disliked the taste of its excipient ethanol and the bitter stimulus denatonium. Those who experienced less bitter and sweeter taste sensations had a different genetic signature than the other panelists. Bitterness and irritation ratings of Kaletra varied by the orphaned bitter receptor gene (TAS2R60), whereas sweetness ratings of Kaletra varied according to the cold receptor gene (TRPM8), which is activated by menthol, an excipient of Kaletra. Neither genotype related to ratings for ethanol or denatonium, however. IMPLICATIONS: The use of a sensory panel holds promise as a first step in determining the nature of individual differences in the palatability of existing pediatric drug formulations and sources of variation. In this era of personalized medicine, the need is great to develop psychophysical tools to determine which drugs will show variation in acceptance by children and whether patterns of individual variation in taste as assessed by adults mirror those of young patients.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Human genetics has provided new insights into the role of protein glycosylation in regulating lipoprotein metabolism. Here we review these new developments and discuss the biological insights they provide. RECENT FINDINGS: Case descriptions of patients with congenital defects in N-glycosylation (CDG-I) frequently describe a distinct hypocholesterolemia in these rare multisystem clinical syndromes. Two novel CDGs with disturbed Golgi homeostasis and trafficking defects result in mixed glycosylation disorders, hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia. In addition, the presence of particular N-glycans is essential for physiological membrane expression of scavenger receptor B1 and for adequate lipolytic activity of endothelial lipase. GalNAc-T2, a specific O-glycosyl transferase, was found to be a direct modulator of HDL metabolism across mammals, validating its relationship with HDL-c found in genome-wide association studies. Furthermore, genetic variation in ASGR1, the major subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), was found to be associated with a reduction in LDL-c and risk of coronary artery disease. SUMMARY: Protein glycosylation plays an important regulatory role in lipoprotein metabolism. Greater insight into how protein glycosylation regulates lipoprotein metabolism could provide novel approaches for the treatment of dyslipidemia.",New insights into the role of glycosylation in lipoprotein metabolism.

"OPINION STATEMENT: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes conditions such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is becoming more prevalent with the elderly being the fastest growing group. Parallel to this, there is an increasing interest in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Nearly half of patients with IBD have used CAM at one time. The elderly patients, however, are burdened by comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, and altered functional status. With increasing use of complementary and alternative medicine in our elderly patients with IBD, it is vital for the provider to provide counsel on drug-herb potential interactions. CAM includes herbal products, diet, dietary supplements, acupuncture, and prayer. In this paper, we will review common CAM, specifically herbs, that are used in patients with IBD including the herb background, suggested use, evidence in IBD, and most importantly, potential interactions with IBD medications used in elderly patients. Most important evidence-based adverse events and drug-herb interactions are summarized.

"OBJECTIVE: To obtain and review workforce data, given the critical demand for developmental pediatricians (DPs). METHODS: Survey of demographics and professional activities of DP physician faculty at Developmental-Behavioral Pediatric (DBP) Research Network fellowship training sites. RESULTS: Of the eligible providers at 12 centers, 76% (n = 50) completed surveys. They were on average 50 years old and mostly female (86%), white (82%), and working full time (74%). Full timers reported a mean 50.2-hour week made up of clinical work (23.2 hours), supervision (5.9 hours), research (8.8 hours), administration (5.2 hours), teaching (1.5 hours), advocacy (1.1 hours), and other (4.3 hours). Compared with those >10 years out of training, the 20 physicians (40%) </=10 years out of fellowship were more likely to be nonwhite (p = .003). Overall faculty interest/expertise (I/E) was highest in autism (90%) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 86%). Those </=10 years out of fellowship had more I/E in autism (p = .05) and less in chronic illness (p = .06) and parenting (p = .06). DPs practiced most frequently in a General DBP Clinic (74%), followed by clinics specific for: Autism (36%), Toddlers (22%), ADHD (20%), Infants (18%) and Preschoolers (16%).

SETTING: Six U.S. hospitals PATIENTS:: Children less than or equal to 18 years old ventilated for greater than or equal to 1 day. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified children with pediatric ventilator-associated conditions and matched them to children without ventilator-associated conditions. Medical records were reviewed for comorbidities and acute care factors. We used bivariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression models to identify factors associated with ventilator-associated conditions. We studied 192 pairs of ventilator-associated conditions cases and matched controls (113 in the PICU and cardiac ICU combined; 79 in the neonatal ICU). In the PICU/cardiac ICU, potential risk factors for ventilator-associated conditions included neuromuscular blockade (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.08-4.87), positive fluid balance (highest quartile compared with the lowest, odds ratio, 7.76; 95% CI, 2.10-28.6), and blood product use (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.70-3.28). Weaning from sedation (i.e., decreasing sedation) or interruption of sedation may be protective (odds ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.18-1.11). In the neonatal ICU, potential risk factors included blood product use (odds ratio, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.02-8.78), neuromuscular blockade use (odds ratio, 3.96; 95% CI, 0.93-16.9), and recent surgical procedures (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 0.77-6.28). Weaning or interrupting sedation was protective (odds ratio, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: In mechanically ventilated neonates and children, we identified several possible risk factors associated with ventilator-associated conditions. Next steps include studying propensity-matched cohorts and prospectively testing whether changes in sedation management, transfusion thresholds, and fluid management can decrease pediatric ventilator-associated conditions rates and improve patient outcomes.",Factors Associated With Pediatric Ventilator-Associated Conditions in Six U.S. Hospitals: A Nested Case-Control Study.
"Multitargeted kinase inhibitors have been shown to improve progression-free survival in patients with structurally progressive, radioactive iodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. While the inclusion criteria for phase 3 clinical trials and clinical practice guidelines provide guidance with regard to the minimal requirements that need to be met prior to initiation of a multitargeted kinase inhibitor, a better way to integrate the rate of structural disease progression with the size of the metastatic foci to more precisely define the optimal time to recommend initiation of therapy for individual patients is needed. In this manuscript we describe how to use assessments of tumor size and growth rates (structural disease doubling times) to define the critical point in time when the volume and rate of progression of metastatic structural disease merits consideration for initiation of systemic therapy (the inflection point).",Novel concepts for initiating multitargeted kinase inhibitors in radioactive iodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.
"The local anesthetic bupivacaine is valuable for perioperative analgesia, but its use in the postoperative period is limited by its short duration of action. Here, we evaluated the application of a slow-release liposomal formulation of bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia. The aim was to assess whether liposomal bupivacaine effectively attenuates postoperative mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in a rat model of incisional pain. Rats (n = 36) were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups: saline, 1 mL/kg SC every 12 h for 2 d; buprenorphine HCl, 0.05 mg/kg SC every 12 h for 2 d (Bup HCl); 0.5% bupivacaine, 2 mg/kg SC local infiltration once (Bupi); liposomal bupivacaine, 1 mg/kg SC local infiltration once (Exp1); and liposomal bupivacaine, 6 mg/kg SC local infiltration once (Exp6). Mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity were evaluated daily on days -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The saline group exhibited both hypersensitivities through all 4 evaluated postoperative days. Bup HCl attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity for 2 d and thermal hypersensitivity for 1 d. Bupi attenuated only thermal hypersensitivity for 4 d. Rats in the Exp1 group showed attenuation of both mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity for 4 d, and those in the Exp6 group had attenuation of mechanical hypersensitivity on day 0 and thermal hypersensitivity for 4 d. These data suggest that a single local infiltration of liposomal bupivacaine at a dose of 1 mg/kg SC effectively attenuates postoperative mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity for 4 d in a rat model of incisional pain.",Use of Liposomal Bupivacaine for Postoperative Analgesia in an Incisional Pain Model in Rats (Rattus norvegicus).

"PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the incidence of acetabular dysplasia at six months of age in patients with breech presentation and previously normal hip ultrasounds, reporting primary radiographic measurements to allow for comparison with other patient cohorts. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of breech infants with initially normal clinical examinations and hip ultrasounds was performed to determine the rate of subsequent acetabular dysplasia and to characterise the distribution of acetabular index (AI). At approximately six months of age, AI was measured bilaterally on anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs and reported using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 94 hips in 47 breech infants were eligible for analysis. All infants demonstrated normal ultrasound findings at a mean age of 6.9 +/- 1.7 weeks and returned for follow-up at a mean age of 6.4 +/- 0.5 months. On AP pelvic radiographs, mean right hip AI was 25.0 degrees , with an interquartile range (IQR) (25(th) -75(th) percentile) of 23 degrees to 27 degrees and mean left hip AI was 25.5 degrees , with an IQR of 22 degrees to 28 degrees . If one applies a single commonly used threshold value for defining dysplasia (AI >/= 30 degrees ), 10/94 hips (10.6%) meet diagnostic criteria. Alternatively, strict adherence to previously established normative AI values stratified by gender and laterality results in 4/94 hips (4.3%) qualifying as significantly dysplastic. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of breech infants who, despite normal initial ultrasound findings, were diagnosed with dysplasia at six months supports observation of breech-born patients beyond six weeks. Reliance on different threshold values for diagnosing acetabular dysplasia can lead to discrepancies in incidence rates.",Incidence of acetabular dysplasia in breech infants following initially normal ultrasound: the effect of variable diagnostic criteria.
"Importance: Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) offers superior cosmetic outcomes and has been gaining wide acceptance; however, its role among patients with BRCA mutations remains controversial. Objective: To report on the oncologic safety of NSM and provide evidence-based data to patients and health care professionals regarding preservation of the nipple-areolar complex during a risk-reducing mastectomy in a population with BRCA mutations. Design, Setting, and Participants: We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 9 institutions' experience with prophylactic NSM from 1968 to 2013 in a cohort of patients with BRCA mutations. Patients with breast cancer were included if they underwent contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy; however, only the prophylactic side was considered in the analysis. Patients found to have an occult primary breast cancer at the time of risk-reducing mastectomy, those having variant(s) of unknown significance, and those undergoing free nipple grafts were excluded. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was development of a new breast cancer after risk-reducing NSM. Three reference data sources were used to model the expected number of events, and this was compared with our observed number of events. Results: A total of 548 risk-reducing NSMs in 346 patients were performed at 9 institutions. The median age at NSM was 41 years (interquartile range, 34.5-47.5 years). Bilateral prophylactic NSMs were performed in 202 patients (58.4%), and 144 patients (41.6%) underwent a unilateral risk-reducing NSM secondary to cancer in the contralateral breast. Overall, 201 patients with BRCA1 mutations and 145 with BRCA2 mutations were included. With median and mean follow-up of 34 and 56 months, respectively, no ipsilateral breast cancers occurred after prophylactic NSM. Breast cancer did not develop in any patients undergoing bilateral risk-reducing NSMs. Using risk models for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, approximately 22 new primary breast cancers were expected without prophylactic NSM. Prophylactic NSM resulted in a significant reduction in breast cancer events (test of observed vs expected events, P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Nipple-sparing mastectomies are highly preventive against breast cancer in a BRCA population. Although the follow-up remains relatively short, NSM should be offered as a breast cancer risk-reducing strategy to appropriate patients with BRCA mutations.",Oncologic Safety of Prophylactic Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy in a Population With BRCA Mutations: A Multi-institutional Study.
"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the contribution of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) to the accumulation of cells with a ductal phenotype in cultured human exocrine pancreatic tissues and reveal the underlying mechanism. METHODS: We sorted and cultured viable cell populations in human exocrine pancreatic tissues with a flow cytometry-based lineage tracing method to evaluate possible mechanisms of ADM. Cell surface markers, gene expression pattern, and sphere formation assay were used to examine ADM. RESULTS: A large proportion of acinar cells gained CD133 expression during the 2-dimensional culture and showed down-regulation of acinar markers and up-regulation of ductal markers, assuming an ADM phenotype. In a serum-free culture condition, ADM induction was mainly dependent on transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) secreted from cultured ductal cells. Human acinar cells when cultured alone for a week in a serum-free condition do not undergo ADM. However, serum may contain other factors besides TGF-beta to induce ADM in human acinar cells. In addition, we found that TGF-beta cannot induce ADM of murine acinar cells. CONCLUSIONS: Ductal cells are the major source of TGF-beta that induces ADM in cultured human exocrine pancreatic tissues. This culture system might be a useful model to investigate the mechanism of ADM in human cells.",Paracrine Secretion of Transforming Growth Factor beta by Ductal Cells Promotes Acinar-to-Ductal Metaplasia in Cultured Human Exocrine Pancreas Tissues.
"Accurate staging is essential in the prognosis and management of pediatric malignancies. Current protocols require screening for marrow infiltration with bone marrow biopsy (BMB) as the gold standard. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is commonly used to complete the staging process and can also be used to evaluate marrow infiltration. OBJECTIVE: To compare PET-CT and BMB in the initial evaluation of bone marrow infiltration in pediatric cancers. DESIGN/METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed new cases of EWS, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and lymphoma diagnosed between January 2009 and October 2014. Each case had undergone both PET-CT and BMB within 4 weeks without treatment in the interval between screening modalities. RESULTS: We reviewed 69 cases. Bone marrow infiltration was demonstrated in 34 cases by PET-CT and in 18 cases by BMB. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of PET-CT were both 100%. Interestingly, the cases in which infiltration was not detected on BMB had an abnormal marrow signal on PET-CT focal or distant to iliac crest. CONCLUSION: PET-CT has a high sensitivity when assessing marrow infiltration in pediatric malignancies. Advances in radiologic modalities may obviate the use of invasive, painful, and costly procedures like BMB. Furthermore, biopsy results are limited by insufficient tissue or the degree of marrow infiltration (diffuse vs. focal disease). PET-CT can improve the precision of biopsy when used as a guiding tool. This study proposes the use of PET-CT as first-line screening for bone marrow infiltration to improve the accuracy of staging in new diagnoses.",PET/CT versus bone marrow biopsy in the initial evaluation of bone marrow infiltration in various pediatric malignancies.
"Increased motivation for highly rewarding food is a major contributing factor to obesity. Most of the literature focuses on the mesolimbic nuclei as the core of reward behavior regulation. However, the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is also a key reward-control locus in the brain. Here we hypothesize that manipulating glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activity selectively in the LH can profoundly affect food reward behavior, ultimately leading to obesity. Progressive ratio operant responding for sucrose was examined in male and female rats, following GLP-1R activation and pharmacological or genetic GLP-1R blockade in the LH. Ingestive behavior and metabolic parameters, as well as molecular and efferent targets, of the LH GLP-1R activation were also evaluated. Food motivation was reduced by activation of LH GLP-1R. Conversely, acute pharmacological blockade of LH GLP-1R increased food motivation but only in male rats. GLP-1R activation also induced a robust reduction in food intake and body weight. Chronic knockdown of LH GLP-1R induced by intraparenchymal delivery of an adeno-associated virus-short hairpin RNA construct was sufficient to markedly and persistently elevate ingestive behavior and body weight and ultimately resulted in a doubling of fat mass in males and females. Interestingly, increased food reinforcement was again found only in males. Our data identify the LH GLP-1R as an indispensable element of normal food reinforcement, food intake and body weight regulation. These findings also show, for we believe the first time, that brain GLP-1R manipulation can result in a robust and chronic body weight gain. The broader implications of these findings are that the LH differs between females and males in its ability to control motivated and ingestive behaviors.","Lateral hypothalamic GLP-1 receptors are critical for the control of food reinforcement, ingestive behavior and body weight."

"INTRODUCTION: Autonomous twitch elicitation at myofascial trigger points from spondylotic radiculopathies-induced denervation supersensitivity can provide favourable pain relief using electrical twitch-obtaining intramuscular stimulation (ETOIMS). AIM: To provide objective evidence that ETOIMS is safe and efficacious in migraine and persistent pain management due to decades-old injuries to head and spine from paediatric American football. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An 83-year-old mildly hypertensive patient with 25-year history of refractory migraine and persistent pain self-selected to regularly receive fee-for-service ETOIMS 2/week over 20 months. He had 180 sessions of ETOIMS. Pain levels, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate/pulse were recorded before and immediately after each treatment alongside highest level of clinically elicitable twitch forces/session, session duration and intervals between treatments. Twitch force grades recorded were from 1 to 5, grade 5 twitch force being strongest. RESULTS: Initially, there was hypersensitivity to electrical stimulation with low stimulus parameters (500 micros pulse-width, 30 mA stimulus intensity, frequency 1.3 Hz). This resolved with gradual stimulus increments as tolerated during successive treatments. By treatment 27, autonomous twitches were noted. Spearman's correlation coefficients showed that pain levels are negatively related to twitch force, number of treatments, treatment session duration and directly related to BP and heart rate/pulse. Treatment numbers and session durations directly influence twitch force. At end of study, headaches and quality of life improved, hypertension resolved and antihypertensive medication had been discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: Using statistical process control methodology in an individual patient, we showed long-term safety and effectiveness of ETOIMS in simultaneous diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of migraine and persistent pain in real time obviating necessity for randomised controlled studies.",American football and other sports injuries may cause migraine/persistent pain decades later and can be treated successfully with electrical twitch-obtaining intramuscular stimulation (ETOIMS).

"Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, and its prevalence has been projected to grow by 40% in the next decade. This increasing prevalence has implications for the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and also for chronic kidney disease. A high BMI is one of the strongest risk factors for new-onset chronic kidney disease. In individuals affected by obesity, a compensatory hyperfiltration occurs to meet the heightened metabolic demands of the increased body weight. The increase in intraglomerular pressure can damage the kidneys and raise the risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the long-term. The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy has increased tenfold in recent years. Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis, and for a number of malignancies including kidney cancer. This year the World Kidney Day promotes education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyle and health policy measures that make preventive behaviors an affordable option.",Obesity and kidney disease: hidden consequences of the epidemic.
"OBJECTIVES: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) carry significant economic burden, as well as morbidity and mortality, especially when caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Several new MRSA-active antibiotics have been developed, including semisynthetic glycopeptides (telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin). Of these, dalbavancin and oritavancin offer extended dosing intervals. METHODS: We performed a systematic review, network meta-analysis and cost analysis to compare the newer glycopeptides to standard care and to each other for the treatment of complicated SSTIs (cSSTI). A search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We also developed a model to evaluate the costs associated with dalbavancin and oritavancin from the third-party payer perspective. RESULTS: Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Network meta-analyses suggested that the clinical response to telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin was similar to standard care (odds ratio (OR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-1.33; OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52-1.18; and OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85-1.33, respectively). Head-to-head comparisons showed no difference in clinical response between oritavancin and dalbavancin (OR 1.36; 95% CI 0.85-2.18), oritavancin and telavancin (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.72-1.31) or dalbavancin and telavancin (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.45-1.13). Telavancin had a higher incidence of overall adverse events compared to standard care (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.10-1.61). Compared to telavancin, there were fewer overall adverse events with dalbavancin (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.45-0.76) and oritavancin (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.55-0.92). Studies were of high quality overall. Our cost analyses demonstrated that dalbavancin and oritavancin were less costly compared to standard care under baseline assumptions and many scenarios evaluated. The use of dalbavancin could save third-party payers $1442 to $4803 per cSSTI, while the use of oritavancin could save $3571 to $6932 per cSSTI. CONCLUSIONS: Dalbavancin and oritavancin demonstrate efficacy and safety comparable to standard care in well-designed RCTs and result in cost savings when standard care is treatment that covers MRSA.","Newer glycopeptide antibiotics for treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections: systematic review, network meta-analysis and cost analysis."
"OBJECTIVE: To analyze reasons for low enrollment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effect of hydrocortisone for cardiovascular insufficiency on survival without neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in term/late preterm newborns. STUDY DESIGN: The original study was a multicenter RCT. Eligibility: 34 weeks' gestation, <72 h old, mechanically ventilated, receiving inotrope. Primary outcome was NDI at 2 years; infants with diagnoses at high risk for NDI were excluded. This paper presents an analysis of reasons for low patient enrollment. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-seven of the 932 otherwise eligible infants received inotropes; however, 207 (81%) had exclusionary diagnoses. Only 12 infants were randomized over 10 months; therefore, the study was terminated. Contributing factors included few eligible infants after exclusions, open-label steroid therapy and a narrow enrollment window. CONCLUSION: Despite an observational study to estimate the population, very few infants were enrolled. Successful RCTs of emergent therapy may require fewer exclusions, a short-term primary outcome, waiver of consent and/or other alternatives.",Barriers to enrollment in a randomized controlled trial of hydrocortisone for cardiovascular insufficiency in term and late preterm newborn infants.
"Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects millions of people worldwide, including over one million children in the United States. Approximately 25% of children born with CHD require intensive surgical intervention within the first year of life. Despite improved rates of survival into adulthood - rates that exceed 90% in the modern era - children and adolescents with CHD remain at risk for neurological injury and a range of neurobehavioral and psychosocial challenges that pose a threat to quality of life across the lifespan. Consequently, as experts in both clinical psychology and brain development, neuropsychologists are becoming increasingly involved in cardiac follow-up and monitoring to promote optimal developmental outcomes. The primary objective of this paper is to provide an evidence-based, clinically-oriented primer on CHD for pediatric neuropsychologists working with this growing population of survivors. Following an introduction to current standard-of-care guidelines for managing children and adolescents with CHD, we present an overview of brain development within the context of CHD, review neuropsychological outcomes, examine factors influencing variability in outcomes, and discuss implications and strategies for clinical assessment.",[Formula: see text]Congenital heart disease: A primer for the pediatric neuropsychologist.

"Objective To evaluate the possible association between antenatal magnesium sulfate treatment with histological chorioamnionitis in patients with singleton or dichorionic twins that had preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Methods This was an observational study performed in patients admitted to the hospital with rupture of membranes before 34 weeks' gestation. The primary outcome was histological chorioamnionitis and the primary predictor was antenatal magnesium sulfate treatment. A logistic regression model was used without consideration of other antenatal medical treatments. Results Among 107 patients with preterm deliveries, 57 were admitted to the hospital before 34 weeks' gestation with preterm premature rupture of membranes. Fifty-cases were excluded from the analysis because they were admitted after 34 weeks' gestation, delivered before 24 weeks' gestation or had intrauterine fetal demise or monochorionic twins. The logistic regression analysis adjusting for maternal age, gravidity, parity, multiple gestation, gestational age at delivery, and birthweight, indicated that patients with singleton pregnancies and histological chorioamnionitis had received magnesium sulfate antenatally more frequently (chi2=6.46; P=0.01). The association between histological chorioamnionitis and magnesium sulfate treatment was not found among patients with dichorionic twin pregnancies with one intact gestational sac. Conclusions In this cohort of patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes admitted to the hospital before 34 week's gestation, those with singleton pregnancies treated antenatally with magnesium sulfate for neonatal neuroprotection had a greater rate of histological chorioamnionitis.",Association of histological chorioamnionitis and magnesium sulfate treatment in singleton and dichorionic twin pregnancies with preterm premature rupture of membranes: preliminary observations.
"BACKGROUND: The vast majority of displaced pediatric supracondylar humeral fractures can be treated successfully with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning. The need for open reduction is difficult to determine a priori and is typically due to the failure of closed reduction attempts or persistent limb ischemia. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of flexion-type supracondylar humeral fractures, the rate of open reduction for flexion-type fractures, and the predictive impact of ulnar nerve injury on the need for open reduction for flexion-type supracondylar humeral fractures. METHODS: We developed a database of consecutive pediatric supracondylar humeral fractures treated operatively at a tertiary care pediatric trauma center from 2000 to 2015. Data recorded included age, mechanism of injury, fracture type (open or closed), fracture pattern (flexion-type or extension-type), concomitant skeletal injury, neurovascular injury, treatment, and surgeon. Radiographs of all flexion-type supracondylar humeral fractures were reviewed in order to confirm the classification of the injury pattern. The rate of open reduction for fractures with a flexion-type injury pattern and for such fractures with and without ulnar nerve injury at presentation was assessed. RESULTS: Of 2,783 consecutive pediatric supracondylar humeral fractures treated by surgeons at our center, 95 (3.4%) were flexion-type fractures. Ulnar nerve injury was noted for 10 (10.5%) of the 95 flexion-type fractures. Open injuries were identified at presentation in 3 (3.2%) of the 95 cases. Among closed fractures, 21 (22.8%) of 92 flexion-type fractures required open reduction compared with 50 (1.9%) of 2,647 extension-type fractures (odds ratio [OR] = 15.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.8 to 27.0; p < 0.001). Among closed flexion-type fractures, open reduction was performed in 6 (60%) of 10 fractures with associated ulnar nerve injury and in 15 (18.3%) of 82 fractures without ulnar nerve injury (OR = 6.7; 95% CI = 1.7 to 26.7; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Among closed supracondylar humeral fractures, the flexion-type injury pattern was associated with a 15.4-fold increase in the odds of open reduction. The presence of an ulnar nerve injury at presentation resulted in an additional 6.7-fold higher risk of open reduction among flexion-type supracondylar humeral fractures. Patients and families should be counseled regarding the high rate of open reduction for flexion-type supracondylar humeral fractures, particularly those with an associated ulnar nerve injury.

"BACKGROUND: Our aims were to (1) describe the frequency of physical activity and prenatal healthcare provider advice about physical activity during pregnancy and (2) examine determinants and correlates of 3rd trimester physical activity and receipt of physical activity advice. METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2008 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. We studied 2669 women from North Carolina and Colorado with data on physical activity frequency in the 3 months prior to pregnancy and during the 3rd trimester and 1584 women from Oklahoma with data on provider advice regarding physical activity during pregnancy. Respondents reported physical activity, defined as 30 min or more of exercise/physical activity (excluding vocationally related activity), in in these categories: <1 day/week, 1-4 days/week, and >/=5 days/week. We defined adherence to American College of Obstetrics & Gynecology (ACOG) criteria as physical activity >/=5 days/week in the 3rd trimester. We performed logistic regression analyses weighted for sampling and adjusted for socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: Forty-two percent of women in North Carolina and Colorado reported 3rd trimester physical activity <1 day/week, 42% 1-4 days/week, 9% >/=5 days/week; 7% reported being told not to exercise. Seventy-two percent of women in Oklahoma reported receiving physical activity advice from a prenatal care provider. Low activity frequency (<1 day/week) prior to pregnancy was strongly associated with low likelihood of ACOG guideline adherence in the 3rd trimester (aOR 0.10, 95% CU 0.04, 0.30 vs. 1-4 days/week). Underweight women were more likely to adhere to ACOG guidelines than normal weight women (aOR 2.27, 95% CI 1.36, 3.79). Overweight women were more likely to receive physical activity advice (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3, 6.3 vs. normal weight), but obese women were not (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.4, 1.2). CONCLUSIONS: Few women meet ACOG guideline criteria for physical activity during pregnancy. Improving physical activity and weight status prior to pregnancy may improve activity levels during pregnancy. Nearly one third did not receive advice about physical activity during prenatal care. Obese women were no more likely to receive advice than their normal weight counterparts, indicating the need for targeted physical activity counseling in this population.",Determinants of physical activity frequency and provider advice during pregnancy.

"Human cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) is considered to be one of the most important SULT isoforms for metabolism, detoxification, and carcinogenesis. This theory is driven by observations that SULT1A1 is widely expressed in multiple tissues and acts on a wide range of phenolic substrates. SULT1A1 is subject to functional common copy number variation (CNV) including deletions or duplications. However, it is less clear how SULT1A1 CNV impacts health and disease. To better understand the biological role of SULT1A1 in human health, we genotyped CNV in 14,275 Marshfield Clinic patients linked to an extensive electronic health record. Since SULT1A1 is linked to steroid metabolism, select serum steroid hormones were measured in 100 individuals with a wide spectrum of SULT1A1 CNV genotypes. Furthermore, comprehensive phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) were conducted using diagnostic codes and clinical text data. For the first time, individuals homozygous null for SULT1A1 were identified in a human population. Thirty-six percent of the population carried >2 copies of SULT1A1 whereas 4% had </=1 copy. Results indicate SULT1A1 CNV was negatively correlated with estrone-sulfate to estrone ratio predominantly in males (E1S/E1; p=0.03, r=-0.21) and may be associated with increased risk for common allergies. The effect of SULT1A1 CNV on circulating estrogen metabolites was opposite to the predicted CNV-metabolite trend based on enzymatic function. This finding, and the potential association with common allergies reported herein, warrants future studies.",Relationship of SULT1A1 copy number variation with estrogen metabolism and human health.
"The cause of PHACE syndrome is unknown. In a study of 218 patients, we examined potential prenatal risk factors for PHACE syndrome. Rates of pre-eclampsia and placenta previa in affected individuals were significantly greater than in the general population.

"The effects of family adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on timing of ASD diagnoses and receipt of therapies were measured using data from the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health. Parametric accelerated failure time models estimated the relationship between family ACEs and both timing of ASD diagnosis and receipt of therapies among US children (age 2-17 years; N = 1624). Compared to children without family ACEs, the adjusted effects of 1-2 and >/= 3 ACEs resulted in prolonged time of diagnoses with time ratios of 1.17 and 1.23. Report of 1-2 and >/= 3 ACEs were associated with a 22 and 27% increase in the median age of entry into services. ACEs may pose significant barriers to diagnoses and treatment of children with ASD.",Delayed Diagnosis and Treatment Among Children with Autism Who Experience Adversity.
"OBJECTIVE: To use administrative medical claims data to identify patients with incident Parkinson disease (PD) prior to diagnosis. METHODS: Using a population-based case-control study of incident PD in 2009 among Medicare beneficiaries aged 66-90 years (89,790 cases, 118,095 controls) and the elastic net algorithm, we developed a cross-validated model for predicting PD using only demographic data and 2004-2009 Medicare claims data. We then compared this model to more basic models containing only demographic data and diagnosis codes for constipation, taste/smell disturbance, and REM sleep behavior disorder, using each model's receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We observed all established associations between PD and age, sex, race/ethnicity, tobacco smoking, and the above medical conditions. A model with those predictors had an AUC of only 0.670 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.668-0.673). In contrast, the AUC for a predictive model with 536 diagnosis and procedure codes was 0.857 (95% CI 0.855-0.859). At the optimal cut point, sensitivity was 73.5% and specificity was 83.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Using only demographic data and selected diagnosis and procedure codes readily available in administrative claims data, it is possible to identify individuals with a high probability of eventually being diagnosed with PD.",A predictive model to identify Parkinson disease from administrative claims data.
"To characterize rectal histology in an inception cohort of children newly diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) and to explore its relationship with clinical indices of disease severity. The PROTECT (Predicting Response to Standardized Pediatric Colitis Therapy) Study enrolled children 17 years of age and younger newly diagnosed with UC. Baseline rectal biopsies were evaluated for acute and chronic inflammation, eosinophilic inflammation (peak eosinophil count > 32 eosinophils/high powered field, eosinophilic cryptitis or abscesses), and architectural/nonarchitectural chronic changes. Correlation with clinical indices including Mayo endoscopy subscore and Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index was performed. Rectal biopsies from 369 patients (mean age, 12.9+/-3.1 y, 50% female) were reviewed. Cryptitis was found in 89%, crypt abscesses in 25%, and eosinophilic inflammation in 58%. Crypt distortion/atrophy was present in 98% of specimens. Higher grades of acute and chronic inflammation were associated with the presence of basal plasmacytosis (P<0.0001), basal lymphoid aggregates (P<0.0001), and surface villiform changes (P<0.0001). A severe Mayo endoscopy subscore was most common among those with severe acute and chronic inflammation, although this relationship was not linear. Severe Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index scores were associated with the absence of or only mild eosinophilic inflammation (<32 eosinophils/high powered field) (P<0.03) and the presence of surface villiform changes (P<0.005). Acute and chronic inflammation, eosinophilic inflammation and chronic changes are common in children newly diagnosed with UC. The clinical and biological implication of low to absent eosinophilic inflammation and the presence of surface villiform changes requires further study.",Histologic Correlates of Clinical and Endoscopic Severity in Children Newly Diagnosed With Ulcerative Colitis.
"OBJECTIVES: Intervertebral disc (IVD) degenerates progressively with age and after injuries. In this study, we aimed to characterize early molecular events underlying disc degeneration using a mouse tail IVD injury model. DESIGN: We have established a transcutaneous minimally invasive approach to induce mouse tail IVD injury under fluoroscopic guidance. Morphological and molecular changes in the injured IVDs are compared with the baseline features of adjacent intact levels. RESULTS: After needle puncture, tail IVDs exhibited time-dependent histological changes. The aggrecan neoepitope VDIPEN was evident from 2 days to 4 wks after injury. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 8 (adam8) is a surface protease known to cleave fibronectin in the IVD. Gene expression of adam8 was elevated at all time points after injury, whereas the increase of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (cxcl)-1 gene expression was statistically significant at 2 days and 2 wks after injury. Type 1 collagen gene expression decreased initially at day 2 but increased at 2 wks after injury, whereas no significant change in type 2 collagen gene expression was observed. The extracellular matrix gene expression pattern is consistent with fibrocartilage formation after injury. CONCLUSIONS: Mouse tail IVDs degenerate after needle puncture, as demonstrated by histological changes and aggrecan degradation. The minimally invasive tail IVD injury model should prove useful to investigators studying mechanisms of IVD degeneration and repair.",Intervertebral Disc Degeneration in a Percutaneous Mouse Tail Injury Model.
"Candidate drugs to counter intracellular polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (Hb S) continue to represent a promising approach to mitigating the primary cause of the pathophysiology associated with sickle cell disease (SCD). One such compound is the naturally occurring antisickling agent, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF), which has been studied in the clinic for the treatment of SCD. As part of our efforts to develop novel efficacious drugs with improved pharmacologic properties, we structurally modified 5-HMF into 12 ether and ester derivatives. The choice of 5-HMF as a pharmacophore was influenced by a combination of its demonstrated attractive hemoglobin modifying and antisickling properties, well-known safety profiles, and its reported nontoxic major metabolites. The derivatives were investigated for their time- and/or dose-dependent effects on important antisickling parameters, such as modification of hemoglobin, corresponding changes in oxygen affinity, and inhibition of red blood cell sickling. The novel test compounds bound and modified Hb and concomitantly increased the protein affinity for oxygen. Five of the derivatives exhibited 1.5- to 4.0-fold higher antisickling effects than 5-HMF. The binding mode of the compounds with Hb was confirmed by X-ray crystallography and, in part, helps explain their observed biochemical properties. Our findings, in addition to the potential therapeutic application, provide valuable insights and potential guidance for further modifications of these (and similar) compounds to enhance their pharmacologic properties.","Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Ester and Ether Derivatives of Antisickling Agent 5-HMF for the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease."
"INTRODUCTION: Data suggest dietary modification can improve clinical responses in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of an autoimmune protocol diet in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: We enrolled adults with active IBD (Harvey-Bradshaw index >/= 5 or partial Mayo score >/=3 and erosions on endoscopy and/or elevated fecal calprotectin). For the autoimmune protocol, patients underwent 6-week elimination followed by 5-week maintenance phase. Clinical indices, laboratories, and biomarkers were assessed at baseline and weeks 6 and 11. Endoscopy was performed at study completion. RESULTS: The final cohort included 15 patients with IBD, with mean disease duration 19 years (SD 14.6) and active biological use in 7 (47%) patients. Nutrient repletion was initiated for deficiencies in vitamin D (n = 3) and iron (n = 6). From week 0 to weeks 6 and 11, mean partial Mayo score significantly improved from 5.8 (SD 1.2) to 1.2 (SD 2.0) and 1.0 (SD 2.0) for ulcerative colitis, and mean Harvey-Bradshaw index significantly improved from 7 (SD 1.5) to 3.6 (SD 2.1) and 3.4 (SD 2.6) for Crohn's disease. C-reactive protein did not significantly change during study. Mean fecal calprotectin improved from 471 (SD 562) to 112 (SD 104) at week 11 (P = 0.12). Among those with follow-up endoscopy at week 11 (n = 7), improvements were noted in simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (n = 1), Rutgeerts score (n = 1), and Mayo endoscopy subscore (n = 4). DISCUSSION: Dietary elimination can improve symptoms and endoscopic inflammation in patients with IBD. Randomized controlled trials are warranted.",Efficacy of the Autoimmune Protocol Diet for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The rate of hospital readmission after discharge has been studied extensively in chronic conditions such as hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure. Causative factors associated with hospital readmission have not been adequately investigated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We studied the rate, causes, and factors that predict readmissions at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year in patients with IBD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the electronic medical record of a tertiary academic medical center, encompassing 3 large hospitals to identify patients discharged between January 2007 and December 2010 with a primary discharge diagnosis of either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The index admission was defined as the first unplanned admission during this period. Readmission was defined as unplanned admission (because of any cause) occurring within 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year from the index admission. To identify factors predictive of readmissions, we compared social, demographic, and clinical features at the index admission of patients with readmission and those with no readmissions. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with 1-month, 3-month, and 1-year readmissions. RESULTS: A total of 439 index admissions with a primary discharge diagnosis of either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease were eligible for inclusion in the study. These patients accounted for a total of 785 admissions to the health system during the study period. The unplanned readmission rates were 5% at 1 week, 14% at 1 month, 23.7% at 3 months, and 39.2% at 1 year. The most common reasons for readmissions were IBD exacerbations, infections, and abdominal pain. On multivariate analysis, receiving total parenteral nutrition (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-4.30) and intensive care unit stay during index admission (OR = 3.61; 95% CI, 1.38-9.46) predicted both early and late readmissions, whereas sex, race, insurer, and outside hospital transfers predicted 1-year readmission. Receiving steroids (OR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.23-1.15) at index admission was protective against 1-month readmission; being discharged on biologics (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-1.02) was protective against 3-month readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Both early and late hospital readmissions are common in patients with IBD. Because frequent readmissions are indicators of poor quality of care, future prospective studies using larger cohorts of patients are needed to identify modifiable factors in patient care before discharge to improve quality of care, prevent readmissions, and consequently reduce health care costs.",Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Predictors and Causes of Early and Late Hospital Readmissions.

"PURPOSE: Newly approved novel drugs in Europe receive a black triangle label to promote pharmacovigilance. With growing momentum for earlier drug approvals and reliance on real-world evidence, we studied if the black triangle label promotes more judicious prescribing. METHODS: We examined whether general practitioners prescribed escitalopram, tadalafil, and vardenafil with a black triangle more cautiously than the same or similar drugs without a black triangle in The Health Improvement Network (UK). We performed interrupted time-series analyses to estimate changes in new prescription rates and nested case-control studies to compare characteristics of new users before and after removal of a black triangle. RESULTS: Prescribing rates to the 33 441 new users of these new drugs were highest shortly after initial approval and declined subsequently; there were no increases in rates of new prescriptions after a black triangle's removal (new prescriptions/million/month postlabel: escitalopram -1.5 [95% CI, -1.9 to -1.2]; tadalafil and vardenafil: -0.1 [95% CI, -0.6 to 0.4]). Among drugs in the same class, loss of a patent had more impact on prescribing rates than loss of a black triangle. People who began taking black triangle drugs were less likely to be young or to have multiple comorbidities or recent hospitalization compared with those starting the same drugs after the label's removal. However, these differences generally reflected secular trends seen also in similar, unlabeled medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated drug approvals could cause more uncertainty about drug effectiveness and safety, but specific labeling of newly approved medicines is unlikely to promote more judicious prescribing.",Impact of the black triangle label on prescribing of new drugs in the United Kingdom: lessons for the United States at a time of deregulation.
"Deficiencies of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I frequently result in leukoencephalopathy in young patients, and different mutations in the genes encoding its subunits are still being uncovered. We report 2 patients with cystic leukoencephalopathy and complex I deficiency with recessive mutations in NDUFA2, an accessory subunit of complex I. The first patient was initially diagnosed with a primary systemic carnitine deficiency associated with a homozygous variant in SLC22A5, but also exhibited developmental regression and cystic leukoencephalopathy, and an additional diagnosis of complex I deficiency was suspected. Biochemical analysis confirmed a complex I deficiency, and whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation in NDUFA2 (c.134A>C, p.Lys45Thr). Review of a biorepository of patients with unsolved genetic leukoencephalopathies who underwent whole-exome or genome sequencing allowed us to identify a second patient with compound heterozygous mutations in NDUFA2 (c.134A>C, p.Lys45Thr; c.225del, p.Asn76Metfs*4). Only 1 other patient with mutations in NDUFA2 and a different phenotype (Leigh syndrome) has previously been reported. This is the first report of cystic leukoencephalopathy caused by mutations in NDUFA2.",Recessive mutations in NDUFA2 cause mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy.
"Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (hPAP) is a rare disorder of pulmonary surfactant accumulation and hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by mutations in CSF2RA (encoding the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] receptor alpha-chain [CD116]), which results in reduced GM-CSF-dependent pulmonary surfactant clearance by alveolar macrophages. While no pharmacologic therapy currently exists for hPAP, it was recently demonstrated that endotracheal instillation of wild-type or gene-corrected mononuclear phagocytes (pulmonary macrophage transplantation [PMT]) results in a significant and durable therapeutic efficacy in a validated murine model of hPAP. To facilitate the translation of PMT therapy to human hPAP patients, a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector was generated expressing a codon-optimized human CSF2RA-cDNA driven from an EF1alpha short promoter (Lv.EFS.CSF2RA(coop)), and a series of nonclinical efficacy and safety studies were performed in cultured macrophage cell lines and primary human cells. Studies in cytokine-dependent Ba/F3 cells demonstrated efficient transduction, vector-derived CD116 expression proportional to vector copy number, and GM-CSF-dependent cell survival and proliferation. Using a novel cell line constructed to express a normal GM-CSF receptor beta subunit and a dysfunctional alpha subunit (due to a function-altering CSF2RA(G196R) mutation) that reflects the macrophage disease phenotype of hPAP patients, it was demonstrated that Lv.EFS.CSF2RA(coop) transduction restored GM-CSF receptor function. Further, Lv.EFS.CSF2RA(coop) transduction of healthy primary CD34(+) cells did not adversely affect cell proliferation or affect the cell differentiation program. Results demonstrate Lv.EFS.CSF2RA(coop) reconstituted GM-CSF receptor alpha expression, restoring GM-CSF signaling in hPAP macrophages, and had no adverse effects in the intended target cells, thus supporting testing of PMT therapy of hPAP in humans.",Function and Safety of Lentivirus-Mediated Gene Transfer for CSF2RA-Deficiency.
"OPINION STATEMENT: Pancreatic cancer surgery is a continuously evolving field. Despite tremendous advances in perioperative outcomes, pancreatic resection is still associated with substantial morbidity, and mortality is not nil. Institutional caseload is a well-established determinant of patient outcomes, and centralization to experienced centers is essential to the safety and oncological appropriateness of the resection. Minimally invasive approaches are increasingly applied for pancreatic resection, even in cancer patients. Nevertheless, the level of evidence in this field remains low. Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy appears potentially beneficial towards some perioperative outcomes, although its oncological results remain incompletely studied. Data regarding perioperative and oncologic outcomes for minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple's resection) is even less mature, but suggest that similar results as the open approach can be achieved in selected, high-volume centers. Conversely, its indiscriminate adoption by inexperienced surgeons and institutions has potential deleterious effects given its steep learning curve. Newer neoadjuvant treatment protocols display enhanced ability to downstage advanced tumors, increasing candidates for potentially curative surgery. Conversely, putative benefits of neoadjuvant treatment in patients with technically resectable tumors have not been reliably demonstrated and its optimal indications remain highly controversial.",Recent Advances in Pancreatic Cancer Surgery.
"PURPOSE: There are currently no evidence-based indications for surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) in patients without flail chest. The purpose of this survey was to identify patients for whom there is relative equipoise (operative vs. non-operative) in order to assist in designing a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Members of the Chest Wall Injury Society were sent an online survey, in which 18 patient scenarios were presented. The baseline patient had >/= three displaced, contiguous fractures and had no other contraindications for surgery. This default scenario was then varied based upon patient age, degree of traumatic brain injury (TBI), fracture series location, and number of abnormal pulmonary physiologic variables (oxygen requirement, respiratory rate, incentive spirometry ability, cough, and numeric pain score). RESULTS: Thirty respondents provided a total of 540 answers. Overall, the majority of responses were in favor of SSRF (n = 413, 84.1%). Furthermore, the vast majority of responses indicated that some degree of pulmonary compromise was necessary to recommend SSRF (n = 44, 90.4%), with >/= two abnormal parameters being the most common threshold (n = 156, 31.8%). Decision to recommend SSRF varied significantly by number of abnormal clinical variables, age, and degree of TBI, but not by fracture series location. Patients aged 85 years old and those with moderate TBI were the least likely to be recommended for SSRF, regardless of abnormal pulmonary physiologic variables. The most appropriate cutoff for equipoise appeared to be a patient aged 21-79 years old, with no or mild TBI, >/= two abnormal pulmonary parameters, and regardless of fracture location (44.8% consensus for SSRF). CONCLUSIONS: SSRF was recommended for most patients with non-flail, displaced rib fractures. However, this recommendation was contingent upon patient age, degree of TBI, and pulmonary clinical status. Results of this survey may be used to inform inclusion criteria for a future randomized, clinical trial.",Indications for surgical stabilization of rib fractures in patients without flail chest: surveyed opinions of members of the Chest Wall Injury Society.
"Tumor heterogeneity can be elucidated by mapping subregions of the lesion with differential imaging characteristics, called habitats. Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE-)MRI can depict the tumor microenvironments by identifying areas with variable perfusion and vascular permeability, since individual tumor habitats vary in the rate and magnitude of the contrast uptake and washout. Of particular interest is identifying areas of hypoxia, characterized by inadequate perfusion and hyper-permeable vasculature. An automatic procedure for delineation of tumor habitats from DCE-MRI was developed as a two-part process involving: (1) statistical testing in order to determine the number of the underlying habitats; and (2) an unsupervised pattern recognition technique to recover the temporal contrast patterns and locations of the associated habitats. The technique is examined on simulated data and DCE-MRI, obtained from prostate and brain pre-clinical cancer models, as well as clinical data from sarcoma and prostate cancer patients. The procedure successfully identified habitats previously associated with well-perfused, hypoxic and/or necrotic tumor compartments. Given the association of tumor hypoxia with more aggressive tumor phenotypes, the obtained in vivo information could impact management of cancer patients considerably.",Delineation of Tumor Habitats based on Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI.
"Impaired diabetic wound healing is associated with a dermal extracellular matrix protein profile favoring proteolysis; within the healing diabetic wound, this is represented by an increase in activated matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs). Treatment of diabetic wounds with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been shown to improve wound healing; however, there has not yet been an assessment of their ability to correct dysregulation of MMPs in diabetic wounds. Furthermore, there has been no prior assessment of the role of microRNA29b (miR-29b), an inhibitory regulatory molecule that targets MMP-9 mRNA. Using in vitro models of fibroblast coculture with MSCs and in vivo murine wound healing models, we tested the hypothesis that MSCs correct dysregulation of MMPs in a microRNA-29b-dependent mechanism. In this study, we first demonstrated that collagen I and III protein content is significantly reduced in diabetic wounds, and treatment with MSCs significantly improves collagen I content in both nondiabetic and diabetic wounds. We then found that MMP-9 gene expression and protein content were significantly upregulated in diabetic wounds, indicating elevated proteolysis. Treatment with MSCs resulted in a decrease in MMP-9 gene expression and protein content level in diabetic wounds 3 and 7 days after wounding. Zymographic analysis indicated that MSC treatment also decreased the amount of activated MMP-9 present in diabetic wounds. Furthermore, miR-29b expression was inversely associated with MMP-9 gene expression; miR-29b expression was decreased in diabetic wounds and diabetic fibroblast. Following treatment of diabetic wounds with MSCs, as well as in diabetic fibroblasts cocultured with MSCs, miR-29b was significantly increased. These findings suggest a potential mechanism through which MSCs enhance diabetic wound healing by improving collagen I content in diabetic wounds through decreasing MMP-9 expression and increasing miR-29b expression.",Mesenchymal stem cells correct impaired diabetic wound healing by decreasing ECM proteolysis.
"Genetic mutations contribute to the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a common, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and repetitive and restricted patterns of behavior. Since neuroligin3 (NLGN3), a cell adhesion molecule at the neuronal synapse, was first identified as a risk gene for ASD, several additional variants in NLGN3 and NLGN4 were found in ASD patients. Moreover, synaptopathies are now known to cause several neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. In humans, NLGNs consist of five family members, and neuroligin1 (NLGN1) is a major component forming a complex on excitatory glutamatergic synapses. However, the significance of NLGN1 in neuropsychiatric disorders remains unknown. Here, we systematically examine five missense variants of NLGN1 that were detected in ASD patients, and show molecular and cellular alterations caused by these variants. We show that a novel NLGN1 Pro89Leu (P89L) missense variant found in two ASD siblings leads to changes in cellular localization, protein degradation, and to the impairment of spine formation. Furthermore, we generated the knock-in P89L mice, and we show that the P89L heterozygote mice display abnormal social behavior, a core feature of ASD. These results, for the first time, implicate rare variants in NLGN1 as functionally significant and support that the NLGN synaptic pathway is of importance in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.",Functional significance of rare neuroligin 1 variants found in autism.
"In-stent restenosis remains an important clinical problem in the era of drug eluting stents. Development of clinical gene therapy protocols for the prevention and treatment of in-stent restenosis is hampered by the lack of adequate local delivery systems. Herein we describe a novel stent-based gene delivery platform capable of providing local arterial gene transfer with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. This system exploits the natural affinity of protein G (PrG) to bind to the Fc region of mammalian IgG, making PrG a universal adaptor for surface immobilization of vector-capturing antibodies (Ab). Our results: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of reversible immobilization of AAV2 vectors using vector tethering by AAV2-specific Ab appended to the stent surface through covalently attached PrG, 2) show sustained release kinetics of PrG/Ab-immobilized AAV2 vector particles into simulated physiological medium in vitro and site-specific transduction of cultured cells, 3) provide evidence of long-term (12 weeks) arterial expression of luciferase with PrG/Ab-tethered AAV2Luc, and 4) show anti-proliferative activity and anti-restenotic efficacy of stent-immobilized AAV2iNOS in the rat carotid artery model of stent angioplasty.",Stent-based delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors with sustained vascular transduction and iNOS-mediated inhibition of in-stent restenosis.

"OBJECTIVES: To analyze radiographic changes in intertrochanteric (IT) fracture alignment after treatment with either a single sliding lag screw or an integrated compressed and locked, dual screw, cephalomedullary nail construct. DESIGN: Retrospective comparative study. SETTING: Level 1 regional trauma center. PATIENTS: 1004 OTA/AO 31A, 31B2.1 fractures treated with either a single screw cephalomedullary nail (Gamma 3) or an integrated dual screw cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) between February 1, 2005, and June 30, 2013. Four hundred thirteen remained after exclusion criteria; 130 were treated with a single screw device (79 stable and 51 unstable), and 283 with an integrated dual screw device (155 stable and 128 unstable). INTERVENTION: Cephalomedullary nail insertion. OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiographic analysis included fracture pattern, fracture reduction, neck-shaft angle (NSA), and femoral neck shortening (FNS) differences at 3, 6, and 12 months. Measurements were normalized using known lag screw dimensions, digitally corrected for magnification. Rotation between x-rays was controlled using a ratio of known to measured dimensions. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The single screw device resulted in 2.5 times more varus collapse (NSA) and 2 times more FNS over 1 year, as compared to the locked, integrated dual screw device, regardless of stability (P < 0.001). NSA and FNS changes were greater for both devices in unstable fracture patterns, but significantly less movement occurred with the dual screw device (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A cephalomedullary nail with 2 integrated proximal screws that can be compressed and then locked seems to maintain initial IT fracture reduction and subsequent position over time, with less varus collapse and less shortening than a single screw device.

"BACKGROUND: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are prevalent in people with neurodegenerative diseases. PURPOSE: In this scoping review the Kales, Gitlin and Lykestos framework is used to answer the question: What high quality evidence exists for the patient, caregiver and environmental determinants of five specific BPSD: aggression, agitation, apathy, depression and psychosis? METHOD: An a priori review protocol was developed; 692 of 6013 articles retrieved in the search were deemed eligible for review. Gough's Weight of Evidence Framework and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias were used. The findings from 56 high quality/low bias articles are summarized. DISCUSSION: Each symptom had its own set of determinants, but many were common across several symptoms: neurodegeneration, type of dementia, severity of cognitive impairments, and declining functional abilities, and to a lesser extent, caregiver burden and communication. CONCLUSION: Research and policy implications are relevant to the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.",Determinants of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A scoping review of the evidence.
"Psychomotor retardation (PMR) is one of the core symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and has a specific pathophysiology, but studies of PMR remains sparse. The purpose of this study was to explore the cerebral blood flow (CBF) of PMR in MDD. One-hundred-seven antidepressant-free MDD patients and 48 normal controls (NCs) were recruited for this study. All subjects underwent arterial spin labeling-magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) for the CBF calculation. MDD patients were divided into the PMR group (N=35) and NPMR (non-PMR) group (N=72) according to the Salpetriere Retardation Rating Scale (SRRS) score. After a baseline MRI scan, patients began to receive antidepressant treatment. Thirty-nine patients (15 PMR, 24 NPMR) who were remitted after 8weeks participated in the follow-up MRI scan. For statistical analysis, subjects with unqualified MRI image and unmatched demographic data were ruled out. Consequently, 30 NCs and 60 patients (30 PMR, 30 NPMR) at baseline as well as 22 patients (11 PMR, 11 NPMR) at follow-up underwent statistical analysis. The PMR group showed significantly decreased CBF in the right primary motor cortex (PMC) at baseline, and the CBF value of the right PMC was significantly correlated with the SRRS score, whereas the CBF of the right PMC was increased in the PMR group at follow-up compared with the baseline in longitudinal comparison. Our findings suggest that the CBF of the right PMC is a potential biomarker of PMR in MDD.",Decreased cerebral blood flow in the primary motor cortex in major depressive disorder with psychomotor retardation.
"INTRODUCTION: Documented gaps in health professionals' training in women's health are a special concern for continuing education (CE). In the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system, women veterans are a numerical minority, preferably assigned to designated women's health primary care providers (DWHPs). DWHPs need to maintain their knowledge and skills in women's health topics, in addition to general internal medicine topics. We explored drivers of VA DWHPs' learning preferences for women's health topics-ie, factors which influence greater and lesser learning interest. METHODS: We conducted semistructured telephone interviews with DWHPs across six VA health care systems. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded in ATLAS.ti. We synthesized results by grouping relevant coded sections of text to form emergent themes. RESULTS: Among the 31 DWHPs interviewed, reported drivers of learning interests among women's health topics were (1) high frequency of clinical incidence of particular issues; (2) perceived appropriateness of particular issues for management in primary care settings; and (3) perceived appropriateness of particular issues for partial management in primary care. Lower interest in particular women's health topics was associated with (1) perceived existing competency or recent training in an issue and (2) perceived need for specialty care management of an issue. DISCUSSION: Understanding drivers of DWHPs' CE learning priorities lays a foundation for developing CE programming that will be of interest to women's health primary care providers. Attention to drivers of learning interests may have applicability beyond women's health, suggesting a general approach for CE programming that prioritizes high-volume topics within the practice scope of target providers.",Drivers of Continuing Education Learning Preferences for Veterans Affairs Women's Health Primary Care Providers.
"OBJECTIVE: Psychotropic medications are frequently prescribed to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but little is known about the prescribing practices of developmental-behavioral pediatricians (DBPs). Our objective was to determine whether clinical site, age, insurance, or comorbidities influenced DBPs prescribing psychotropic medication for children with ASD. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed using electronic health record data of all patients with ASD seen at 3 academic developmental-behavioral pediatrics (DBP) clinical programs from January 2010 to December 2011. Data included age, diagnoses, primary insurance, and medications prescribed. Factors associated with prescribing psychotropic medication were examined using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Sites varied in the frequency with which they prescribed psychotropic medication for children with ASD (site 1: 33.1%, site 2: 49.3%, site 3: 4.0%; p < .001). We found that the following factors predicted prescribing of psychotropic medications: comorbidities (odds ratio [OR]: 2.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.58-3.18), age, and primary insurance. However, the impact of insurance depended on age. For 3- to 5-year-old children, those on Medicaid were more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications than those with private insurance (OR: 1.65; 95% CI, 1.29-2.12). This was particularly true for alpha-2-adrenergic agonists (OR: 2.48; 95% CI, 1.56-3.92) and atypical antipsychotics (OR: 2.57; 95% CI, 1.46-4.55). CONCLUSION: There are large variations in prescribing psychotropic medication to children with ASD at 3 academic DBP programs. Further research is needed to understand factors that contribute to higher use of psychotropic medication in young children with Medicaid.",Factors Associated with Developmental Behavioral Pediatricians Prescribing Psychotropic Medication to Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Study of Three DBPNet Sites.
"BACKGROUND: HIV prevention interventions in the United States have failed to eliminate racial inequities. Here, we evaluate factors associated with racial inequities in HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs using HIV Prevention Trial Network 037 data. METHODS: We measured racial homophily (ie, all members share the same race), being in an HIV+ network (network with >/=1 HIV+ member), and drug and sex risk behaviors. A 2-level logistic regression with a random intercept evaluated the association between being in an HIV+ network and race adjusting for individual-level and network-level factors. RESULTS: Data from 232 index participants and 464 network members were included in the analysis. Racial homophily was high among blacks (79%) and whites (70%); 27% of all-black, 14% of all-white, and 23% of racially mixed networks included HIV+ members. Sex risk was similar across networks, but needle sharing was significantly lower in all-black (23%) compared with all-white (48%) and racially mixed (46%) networks. All-black [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4 to 9.5] and racially mixed (AOR, 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1 to 3.7) networks were more likely to include HIV+ network members; other factors associated with being in HIV+ network included homelessness (AOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.2), recent incarceration (AOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.7), and cocaine injection (AOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.7). Risk behaviors were not associated with being in an HIV+ network. CONCLUSION: Despite having lower drug risk behavior, all-black networks disproportionately included HIV+ members. HIV prevention interventions for people who inject drugs need to go beyond individual risk and consider the composition of risk networks.",Racial Inequities in HIV Prevalence and Composition of Risk Networks Among People Who Inject Drugs in HIV Prevention Trial Network 037.
"Global synchronization across specialized brain networks is a common feature of network models and in-vivo electrical measurements. Although the imaging of specialized brain networks with blood oxygenation sensitive resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has enabled detailed study of regional networks, the study of globally correlated fluctuations with rsfMRI is confounded by spurious contributions to the global signal from systemic physiologic factors and other noise sources. Here we use an alternative rsfMRI method, arterial spin labeled perfusion MRI, to characterize global correlations and their relationship to correlations and anti-correlations between regional networks. Global fluctuations that cannot be explained by systemic factors dominate the fluctuations in cerebral blood flow. Power spectra of these fluctuations are band limited to below 0.05 Hz, similar to prior measurements of regional network fluctuations in the brain. Removal of these global fluctuations prior to measurement of regional networks reduces all regional network fluctuation amplitudes to below the global fluctuation amplitude and changes the strength and sign of inter network correlations. Our findings support large amplitude, globally synchronized activity across networks that require a reassessment of regional network amplitude and correlation measures.",Global fluctuations of cerebral blood flow indicate a global brain network independent of systemic factors.
"OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of lipiodol deposition in the lesion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on the necrosis area of percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 44 patients with HCC with 56 nodules, with a size ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 cm, was selected in our study. About 23 patients (26 nodules) underwent PMCT treatment only as Group A and 21 patients (30 nodules) were treated by PMCT-combined TACE as Group B. All patients underwent PMCT with single-electrode and one-point ablation. Paired t-test was used to analyze pre- and postoperatively the volume of tumor and the necrosis volume after PMCT. Independent t-test was used to compare the difference in the necrosis area between two groups (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: All patients underwent PMCT or PMCT combined with TACE successfully. The tumor and necrosis size of Group A was 16.29+/-19.23 cm(3) and 17.98+/-18.49 cm(3) (P=0.650), and 11.95+/-12.78 cm(3) and 16.60+/-11.70 cm(3) of Group B (P=0.017). There was no significant difference on necrosis volume between the two groups (P=0.581). The necrosis area of Group B was larger than the size of the tumor (P=0.017), but the ablation area of the two groups was smaller than the theoretic area (P=0.001). (The theoretic area means that the necrosis area of ablation should be 1.0 cm larger than the tumor in diameter.). CONCLUSION: PMCT combined with TACE could enlarge the ablation area, but will not lead to an ideal necrosis area than the PMCT alone. The lipiodol deposition in the tumor lesion may hinder the expansion of the heating field. Therefore, further research was needed.",The effect of lipiodol deposition in HCC after TACE on the necrosis range of PMCT.
"Sex hormones affect immune responses and might promote autoimmunity. Endocrine disrupting chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA) may mimic their immune effects. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are pivotal initiators of immune responses upon activation by danger signals coming from pathogens or distressed tissues through triggering of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We generated in vitro murine cDCs in the absence of estrogens and measured the effects of exogenously added estrogen or BPA on their differentiation and activation by the TLR ligands LPS and CpG. Estrogen enhanced the differentiation of GM-CSF-dependent cDCs from bone marrow precursors in vitro, and the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen and fulvestrant blocked these effects. Moreover, estrogen augmented the upregulation of costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12p70 and TNFalpha) upon stimulation by TLR9 ligand CpG, while the response to LPS was less estrogen-dependent. These effects are partially explained by an estrogen-dependent regulation of TLR9 expression. BPA did not promote cDC differentiation nor activation upon TLR stimulation. Our results suggest that estrogen promotes immune responses by increasing DC activation, with a preferential effect on TLR9 over TLR4 stimulation, and highlight the influence of estrogens in DC cultures, while BPA does not mimic estrogen in the DC functions that we tested.",Bisphenol A Does Not Mimic Estrogen in the Promotion of the In Vitro Response of Murine Dendritic Cells to Toll-Like Receptor Ligands.
"The amygdala brain region has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia through emotion processing. However, transcriptome messages in the amygdala of schizophrenia patients have not been well studied. We used RNA sequencing to investigate gene-expression profiling in the amygdala tissues, and identified 569 upregulated and 192 downregulated genes from 22 schizophrenia patients and 24 non-psychiatric controls. Gene functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the downregulated genes were enriched in pathways such as 'synaptic transmission' and 'behavior', whereas the upregulated genes were significantly over-represented in gene ontology pathways such as 'immune response' and 'blood vessel development'. Co-expression-based gene network analysis identified seven modules including four modules significantly associated with 'synaptic transmission', 'blood vessel development' or 'immune responses'. Taken together, our study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism of schizophrenia, suggesting that precision-tailored therapeutic approaches aimed at normalizing the expression/function of specific gene networks could be a promising option in schizophrenia.",RNA-seq analysis of amygdala tissue reveals characteristic expression profiles in schizophrenia.
"The plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) consists of serine proteases, prekallikrein (pKal) and factor XII (FXII), and a cofactor, high-MW kininogen (HK). Upon activation, activated pKal and FXII cleave HK to release bradykinin. Activation of this system has been noted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and its pathogenic role has been characterized in animal arthritic models. In this study, we generated 2 knockout mouse strains that lacked pKal and HK and determined the role of KKS in autoantibody-induced arthritis. In a K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis (STIA) model, mice that lacked HK, pKal, or bradykinin receptors displayed protective phenotypes in joint swelling, histologic changes in inflammation, and cytokine production; however, FXII-deficient mice developed normal arthritis. Inhibition of Kal ameliorated arthritis severity and incidence at early stage STIA and reduced the levels of major cytokines in joints. In addition to releasing bradykinin from HK, Kal directly activated monocytes to produce proinflammatory cytokines, up-regulated their C5aR and FcRIII expression, and released C5a. Immune complex increased pKal activity, which led to HK cleavage. The absence of HK is associated with a decrease in joint vasopermeability. Thus, we identify a critical role for Kal in autoantibody-induced arthritis with pleiotropic effects, which suggests that it is a new target for the inhibition of arthritis.-Yang, A., Zhou, J., Wang, B., Dai, J., Colman, R.

"Rho family GTPases are critical regulators of cellular functions that play important roles in cancer progression. Aberrant activity of Rho small G-proteins, particularly Rac1 and their regulators, is a hallmark of cancer and contributes to the tumorigenic and metastatic phenotypes of cancer cells. This review examines the multiple mechanisms leading to Rac1 hyperactivation, particularly focusing on emerging paradigms that involve gain-of-function mutations in Rac and guanine nucleotide exchange factors, defects in Rac1 degradation, and mislocalization of Rac signaling components. The unexpected pro-oncogenic functions of Rac GTPase-activating proteins also challenged the dogma that these negative Rac regulators solely act as tumor suppressors. The potential contribution of Rac hyperactivation to resistance to anticancer agents, including targeted therapies, as well as to the suppression of antitumor immune response, highlights the critical need to develop therapeutic strategies to target the Rac pathway in a clinical setting.

"Pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) are commonly associated with BRAF gene fusions that aberrantly activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This has led to PLGG clinical trials utilizing RAF- and MAPK pathway-targeted therapeutics. Whole-genome profiling of PLGGs has also identified rare gene fusions involving another RAF isoform, CRAF/RAF1, in PLGGs and cancers occuring in adults. Whereas BRAF fusions primarily dysregulate MAPK signaling, the CRAF fusions QKI-RAF1 and SRGAP3-RAF1 aberrantly activate both the MAPK and phosphoinositide-3 kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) signaling pathways. Although ATP-competitive, first-generation RAF inhibitors (vemurafenib/PLX4720, RAFi) cause paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in BRAF-fusion tumors, inhibition can be achieved with 'paradox breaker' RAFi, such as PLX8394. Here we report that, unlike BRAF fusions, CRAF fusions are unresponsive to both generations of RAFi, vemurafenib and PLX8394, highlighting a distinct responsiveness of CRAF fusions to clinically relevant RAFi. Whereas PLX8394 decreased BRAF-fusion dimerization, CRAF-fusion dimerization is unaffected primarily because of robust protein-protein interactions mediated by the N-terminal non-kinase fusion partner, such as QKI. The pan-RAF dimer inhibitor, LY3009120, could suppress CRAF-fusion oncogenicity by inhibiting dimer-mediated signaling. In addition, as CRAF fusions activate both the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways, we identify combinatorial inhibition of the MAPK/mTOR pathway as a potential therapeutic strategy for CRAF-fusion-driven tumors. Overall, we define a mechanistic distinction between PLGG-associated BRAF- and CRAF/RAF1 fusions in response to RAFi, highlighting the importance of molecularly classifying PLGG patients for targeted therapy. Furthermore, our study uncovers an important contribution of the non-kinase fusion partner to oncogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies against PLGG-associated CRAF fusions and possibly pan-cancer CRAF fusions.",CRAF gene fusions in pediatric low-grade gliomas define a distinct drug response based on dimerization profiles.
"BACKGROUND: The Veterans Health Administration does not routinely collect and document sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data, despite existing health disparities among sexual and gender minority Veterans. Because of the legacy of previous Department of Defense (DoD) policies that prohibited disclosure of sexual or gender minority identities among active duty personnel, Veterans may be reluctant to respond to SOGI questions. OBJECTIVES: This population-based study assesses item nonresponse to SOGI questions by Veteran status. RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of data from a population-based sample of adults in 20 US states that elected to administer a SOGI module in the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Prevalence of SOGI refusals and responses of ""don't know"" were compared for Veterans and non-Veterans. SUBJECTS: Veterans (n=22,587) and non-Veterans (n=146,475) were surveyed. RESULTS: Nearly all Veteran respondents (>/=98%) completed the SOGI questions, with 95.4% identifying as heterosexual, 1.2% as gay or lesbian, 1.2% as bisexual, and 0.59% as transgender. A significantly lower proportion of Veterans than non-Veterans refuse to answer sexual orientation (1.5% vs. 1.9%). There was no difference between Veterans and non-Veterans in responses for gender identity. CONCLUSIONS: Veterans are just as likely as non-Veterans to complete SOGI items in survey research. Asking Veterans about SOGI is unlikely to yield significant nonresponse. These data suggest that future research should investigate Veterans' perspectives on being asked about SOGI in research settings and as part of routine clinical care.",Will Veterans Answer Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Questions?
"BACKGROUND: Patient engagement has become a major focus of health care improvement efforts nationally. Although evidence suggests patient engagement can be beneficial to patients, it has not been consistently defined, operationalized, or translated into practice. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to develop a toolkit to help providers increase patient engagement and reduce disparities in patient engagement. RESEARCH DESIGN: We used qualitative interviews and observations with staff at primary care sites nationally to identify patient engagement practices and resources used to engage patients. We then used a modified Delphi process, that included a series of conference calls and surveys, where stakeholders reduced lists of engagement practices based on perceived feasibility and importance to develop a toolkit for patient engagement. SAMPLING: Sites were selected for interviews and site visits based on the concentration of minority patients served and performance on a measure of patient engagement, with the goal of highlighting practices at sites that successfully serve minority patients. RESULTS: We created a toolkit consisting of patient engagement practices and resources. No identified practice or resource specifically targeted patient engagement of minorities or addressed disparities. However, high-performing, high-minority-serving sites tended to describe more staff training opportunities and staff feedback mechanisms. In addition, low-performing and high-minority-serving sites more often reported barriers to implementation of patient engagement practices. CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders agreed on feasible and important engagement practices. Implementation of this toolkit will be tracked to better understand patient engagement and its effect on patient-centered care and related disparities in care.",Creating a Toolkit to Reduce Disparities in Patient Engagement.
"BACKGROUND: Disparities in hypertension control persist for African American Veterans. OBJECTIVE: To enhance cultural relevance of hypertension control self-management education, in a multisite, stratified randomized trial, we tested an interactive Veteran-to-Veteran storytelling digital video disk (DVD) intervention created with Veteran partners, versus an education-only DVD comparison. METHODS: At 3 VA facilities, African American Veterans with uncontrolled hypertension were randomized to storytelling DVD intervention or didactic comparison DVD and followed for 6 months. We hypothesized that follow-up blood pressure (BP) would be lower among Veterans in the intervention group. RESULTS: African American Veterans (N=619) were 92% male, 39% over age 65, most had a high-school education, over 50% of both the intervention and comparison group reported a household income of <$20,000, and 40% had less than adequate health literacy. At baseline, mean intervention and comparison group BPs were 138/80 and 139/81 mm Hg, respectively; at 6 months, mean systolic BP (SBP) increased by 0.1 in the intervention group and by 1.9 for the comparison group; diastolic BP fell by 0.1 in the intervention group and rose by 0.2 in the comparison group. No differences between the intervention and control groups were statistically significant (all P>0.3). Site differences were large; at one, the intervention group improved while the comparison groups deteriorated, resulting in 6.3 and 3.9 mm Hg more improvement for the intervention group in SBP and diastolic BP (P=0.06 and 0.04), respectively; at the other 2 sites, there were positive and negative changes, all small, in the 2 measures, with minimal differences-one site favored the comparison group and the other, the intervention (these comparisons did not approach statistical significance (all P>0.20). In a secondary analysis stratified by baseline BP, there was no intervention effect among those with uncontrolled BP, but intervention patients who were in control at baseline were more likely to stay in control, compared with comparison [SBP increase by 6.3 mm Hg (SD=14.4) among intervention, and by 10.9 mm Hg (SD=16.9) in comparison, P=0.02]. CONCLUSIONS: In this multisite trial, we did not find a significant overall storytelling intervention effect (Clinicaltrials.gov Reg. #NCT01276197).",African American Veterans Storytelling: A Multisite Randomized Trial to Improve Hypertension.
"Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) occur in 15%-20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), leading to visual deficits in fewer than half of these individuals. The goal of chemotherapy is to preserve vision, but vision loss in NF1-associated OPG can be unpredictable. Determining which child would benefit from chemotherapy and, equally important, which child is better observed without treatment can be difficult. Unfortunately, despite frequent imaging and ophthalmologic evaluations, some children experience progressive vision loss before treatment. Indications for chemotherapy usually are based on a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of vision, but reliable vision evaluation can be challenging in young children with NF1-OPG. The ability to identify and predict impending vision loss could potentially improve management decisions and visual outcomes. To address this challenge, ophthalmologic, electrophysiologic, and imaging biomarkers of vision in NF1-OPG have been proposed. We review current recommendations for the surveillance of children at risk for NF1-OPG, outline guidelines for initiating therapy, and describe the utility of proposed biomarkers for vision.","Optic Pathway Gliomas in Neurofibromatosis Type 1: An Update: Surveillance, Treatment Indications, and Biomarkers of Vision."

"A recent effort has been made to better characterize the genetic architecture of schizophrenia, and apply a precision medicine model to its treatment. In pursuing this approach, it is likely that ethical concerns regarding cost-benefit uncertainties, the duty to inform and confidentiality will arise. Due to the complexity of schizophrenia's genetic profile, research efforts must be weighed against the risk to human subjects and the required consumption of valuable healthcare resources. Genetic risk profiles must be judged in conjunction with actionability and must be fully explained to patients and others potentially affected. However, confidentiality should be of paramount importance due to the presence of a risk-state phenotype, meaning the associated presence of clinically detectable neurocognitive deficiencies in those with elevated schizophrenia risk profiles.",Ethical Application of Precision Medicine to Schizophrenia Management.
"BACKGROUND: Some individuals who appear poorly retained by clinic visit-based retention measures are using antiretroviral therapy (ART) and maintaining viral suppression. We examined whether individuals with a gap in HIV primary care (>/=180 days between HIV outpatient clinic visits) obtained ART during that gap after 180 days. SETTING: HIV Research Network data from 5 sites and Medicaid Analytic Extract eligibility and pharmacy data were combined. METHODS: Factors associated with having both an HIV primary care gap and a new (ie, nonrefill) ART prescription during a gap were evaluated with multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 6892 HIV Research Network patients, 6196 (90%) were linked to Medicaid data, and 4275 had any Medicaid ART prescription. Over half (54%) had occasional gaps in HIV primary care. Women, older people, and those with suppressed viral load were less likely to have a gap. Among those with occasional gaps (n = 2282), 51% received a new ART prescription in a gap. Viral load suppression before gap was associated with receiving a new ART prescription in a gap (odds ratio = 1.91, 95% confidence interval: 1.57 to 2.32), as was number of days in a gap (odds ratio = 1.04, 95% confidence interval: 1.02 to 1.05), and the proportion of months in the gap enrolled in Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid-insured individuals commonly receive ART during gaps in HIV primary care, but almost half do not. Retention measures based on visit frequency data that do not incorporate receipt of ART and/or viral suppression may misclassify individuals who remain suppressed on ART as not retained.",Assessing Antiretroviral Use During Gaps in HIV Primary Care Using Multisite Medicaid Claims and Clinical Data.
"PROBLEM: Academic health centers face increasing challenges in pursuing and maintaining clinical excellence in their tripartite mission. At Penn Medicine, an institution-wide strategic planning process was initiated in 2012. Among the recommendations that arose from that process was to enhance the recognition of Penn Medicine's most outstanding clinicians. The Academy of Master Clinicians (AoMC) was founded in 2013. APPROACH: The ad hoc committee charged with the development and implementation of the AoMC provided a mission statement, eligibility criteria, and a process for nomination and selection of AoMC members. This process was inclusive, extending to all entities of Penn Medicine. Various forms of institutional service were incorporated into the expectations for membership. OUTCOMES: To date, 53 clinicians have been selected for membership in the AoMC. Members meet monthly to focus on significant institutional issues. Initiatives are identified for member leadership and participation. Members are engaged in activities and programs for medical students, residents, and faculty, focusing on areas such as career advising, faculty development, physician burnout, and practice operations. The executive vice president (EVP)/dean has commented that the AoMC is ""highly visible and impactful.""

In addition, at the end of each academic year, the members of the AoMC determine two to three new initiatives on which to work to formulate issues and potential actions.",The Academy of Master Clinicians: Recognition of Clinical Excellence Within an Academic Medical Center.
"Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune condition with an unpredictable course that may lead to permanent facial disfigurement. Eyelid retraction is one of the most common findings, and frequently demands attention due to ocular exposure and impaired cosmesis. Surgical treatment remains the most effective option, but there is a role for temporary corrections during the active phase of the disease, as well as in patients who are poor surgical candidates. The aim of this review is to describe the non-surgical modalities currently available for treatment of eyelid malposition in TED. The authors have focused on the use of hyaluronic acid, triamcinolone injections and botulinum toxin type A as non-surgical treatment alternatives, paying special attention to dosing, technique, efficacy and duration of effect. Non-surgical treatment modalities may represent viable in cases where surgical correction is not an option. Although temporary, these modalities appear to be beneficial for ocular exposure remediation, improving quality of life and broadening our therapeutic arsenal.",Non-surgical treatment for eyelid retraction in thyroid eye disease (TED).
"BACKGROUND: The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network requires that United States transplant centers maintain follow-up with living donors for 2 years postdonation, but lack of donor follow-up is pervasive. Donor characteristics, including younger age, minority race, and lower education, have been associated with incomplete follow-up, but it is unknown whether altruistic donors, having no previous connection to their recipient, differ from traditional donors in their likelihood of follow-up. METHODS: Using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data, we examined all adult living kidney donors from 2005 to 2015 (n = 63 592) classified as altruistic or traditional, and compared likelihood of 6-month medical follow-up using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Altruistic donors did not differ from traditional donors in likelihood of follow-up (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.06). Among previously identified at-risk subgroups, however, altruistic donors were more likely to have follow-up than their traditional counterparts, including those who were younger (aRR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.09), had less than college education (aRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00-1.11), and were unmarried (aRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12). Having medical follow-up at 6 months was significantly associated with having follow-up at 1 year (aRR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.75-1.93) and 2 years (aRR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.56-1.70) postdonation. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide additional granularity on living donor phenotypes associated with short-term (6 month) postdonation follow-up, which is important given its association with future likelihood of follow-up. These findings offer the opportunity to tailor and direct educational efforts to increase living donor follow-up, particularly among groups at higher risk of loss to follow-up.",Living Kidney Donor Phenotype and Likelihood of Postdonation Follow-up.
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe important barriers to exercise in older women with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) from the patient and provider perspectives. METHODS: Six focus groups (2 in active women, 2 in sedentary women, and 2 in providers) were conducted with 36 women with UUI and 18 providers. Focus group discussions were transcribed verbatim. All transcripts were coded and analyzed by 2 independent reviewers. Investigators identified emergent themes and concepts using a modified biopsychosocial conceptual model. RESULTS: A wide range of physical, psychological, social, and environmental factors were perceived to influence exercise. Although women with UUI identified pain as a strong barrier to exercise, providers did not. Both women with UUI and providers identified shame associated with incontinence as a significant barrier, and, conversely, satisfaction with UUI treatment was noted as an enabler for exercising. Women and providers had incongruent views on the need for supervision during exercise; women viewed supervision as a barrier to exercise, whereas providers viewed lack of supervision as a barrier to exercise. Opportunity for socialization was noted as a major enabler of exercise by all groups and suggests that exercise programs that promote interactions with peers may increase exercise participation. The importance of financial incentive and reimbursement was congruent between women and their providers. CONCLUSIONS: Women with UUI have unique perspectives on barriers to exercise. Understanding women's perspective can aid clinicians and researchers in improving exercise counseling and in creating exercise programs for women with UUI.",Barriers to Exercise Among Women With Urgency Urinary Incontinence: Patient and Provider Perspectives.
"Purpose To identify developmental neuroradiologic findings in a large cohort of carriers who have deletion and duplication at 16p11.2 (one of the most common genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder [ASD]) and assess how these features are associated with behavioral and cognitive outcomes. Materials and Methods Seventy-nine carriers of a deletion at 16p11.2 (referred to as deletion carriers; age range, 1-48 years; mean age, 12.3 years; 42 male patients), 79 carriers of a duplication at 16p11.2 (referred to as duplication carriers; age range, 1-63 years; mean age, 24.8 years; 43 male patients), 64 unaffected family members (referred to as familial noncarriers; age range, 1-46 years; mean age, 11.7 years; 31 male participants), and 109 population control participants (age range, 6-64 years; mean age, 25.5 years; 64 male participants) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and completed cognitive and behavioral tests. MR images were reviewed for development-related abnormalities by neuroradiologists. Differences in frequency were assessed with a Fisher exact test corrected for multiple comparisons. Unsupervised machine learning was used to cluster radiologic features and an association between clusters and cognitive and behavioral scores from IQ testing, and parental measures of development were tested by using analysis of covariance. Volumetric analysis with automated segmentation was used to confirm radiologic interpretation. Results For deletion carriers, the most prominent features were dysmorphic and thicker corpora callosa compared with familial noncarriers and population control participants (16%; P < .001 and P < .001, respectively) and a greater likelihood of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia (30.7%; P < .002 and P < .001, respectively) and Chiari I malformations (9.3%; P < .299 and P < .002, respectively). For duplication carriers, the most salient findings compared with familial noncarriers and population control participants were reciprocally thinner corpora callosa (18.6%; P < .003 and P < .001, respectively), decreased white matter volume (22.9%; P < .001, and P < .001, respectively), and increased ventricular volume (24.3%; P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). By comparing cognitive assessments to imaging findings, the presence of any imaging feature associated with deletion carriers indicated worse daily living, communication, and social skills compared with deletion carriers without any radiologic abnormalities (P < .005, P < .002, and P < .004, respectively). For the duplication carriers, presence of decreased white matter, callosal volume, and/or increased ventricle size was associated with decreased full-scale and verbal IQ scores compared with duplication carriers without these findings (P < .007 and P < .004, respectively). Conclusion In two genetically related cohorts at high risk for ASD, reciprocal neuroanatomic abnormalities were found and determined to be associated with cognitive and behavioral impairments.

"BACKGROUND: The clearance of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A substrates is reported to be reduced with lower age, inflammation and obesity. As it is unknown what the overall influence is of these factors in the case of obese adolescents vs. morbidly obese adults, we studied covariates influencing the clearance of the CYP3A substrate midazolam in a combined analysis of data from obese adolescents and morbidly obese adults. METHODS: Data from 19 obese adolescents [102.7 kg (62-149.5 kg)] and 20 morbidly obese adults [144 kg (112-186 kg)] receiving intravenous midazolam were analysed, using population pharmacokinetic modelling (NONMEM 7.2). In the covariate analysis, the influence of study group, age, total body weight (TBW), developmental weight (WTfor age and length) and excess body weight (WTexcess = TBW - WTfor age and length) was evaluated. RESULTS: The population mean midazolam clearance was significantly higher in obese adolescents than in morbidly obese adults [0.71 (7%) vs. 0.44 (11%) L/min; p < 0.01]. Moreover, clearance in obese adolescents increased with TBW (p < 0.01), which seemed mainly explained by WTexcess, and for which a so-called 'excess weight' model scaling WTfor age and length to the power of 0.75 and a separate function for WTexcess was proposed. DISCUSSION: We hypothesise that higher midazolam clearance in obese adolescents is explained by less obesity-induced suppression of CYP3A activity, while the increase with WTexcess is explained by increased liver blood flow. The approach characterising the influence of obesity in the paediatric population we propose here may be of value for use in future studies in obese adolescents.",Higher Midazolam Clearance in Obese Adolescents Compared with Morbidly Obese Adults.

"PURPOSE: Observation and description are critical to the practice of medicine, and to ophthalmology in particular. However, medical education does not provide explicit training in these areas, and medical students are often criticized for deficiencies in these skills. We sought to evaluate the effects of formal observation training in the visual arts on the general and ophthalmologic observational skills of medical students. DESIGN: Randomized, single-masked, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six first-year medical students, randomized 1:1 into art-training and control groups. METHODS: Students in the art-training group were taught by professional art educators at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, during 6 custom-designed, 1.5-hour art observation sessions over a 3-month period. All subjects completed pre- and posttesting, in which they described works of art, retinal pathology images, and external photographs of eye diseases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Grading of written descriptions for observational and descriptive abilities by reviewers using an a priori rubric and masked to group assignment and pretesting/posttesting status. RESULTS: Observational skills, as measured by description testing, improved significantly in the training group (mean change +19.1 points) compared with the control group (mean change -13.5 points), P = 0.001. There were significant improvements in the training vs. control group for each of the test subscores. In a poststudy questionnaire, students reported applying the skills they learned in the museum in clinically meaningful ways at medical school. CONCLUSIONS: Art observation training for first-year medical students can improve clinical ophthalmology observational skills. Principles from the field of visual arts, which is reputed to excel in teaching observation and descriptive abilities, can be successfully applied to medical training. Further studies can examine the impact of such training on clinical care.",A Randomized Controlled Study of Art Observation Training to Improve Medical Student Ophthalmology Skills.
"Neurological manifestations related to electrolyte disorders, drug toxicity, and uremia are common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Seizures and coma are frequent complications of acute renal insufficiency (uremia), whereas peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy, observed in progressive uremia, are terminal events. Failure to excrete metabolic products causes their accumulation and can lead to severe intoxication. Clinically, the signs and symptoms of uremia can vary widely, depending on the biological characteristics of the patient, the specific type of renal disease, and the time of the uremic intoxication. CKD is an increasing problem worldwide and is now being recognized as a global health burden particularly for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischemic events. Despite improvements in the medical management of advanced CKD, including dialysis and transplantation, patients manifest a number of symptoms that neurologists are often confronted with. Appropriate drug dosing, awareness of potential side effects of medications, prompt diagnosis, and treatment are essential in preventing neurological long-term morbidity and mortality.",Neurological Complications of Renal Disease.
"The locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) system is an understudied circuit in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is thought to play an important role in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases involving catecholamine neurotransmitters. Understanding the expression and distribution of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, a primary component of AD, under basal conditions and under conditions of NE perturbation within the coeruleo-cortical pathway may be important for understanding its putative role in pathological states. Thus, the goal of this study is to define expression levels and the subcellular distribution of endogenous Abeta with respect to noradrenergic profiles in the rodent LC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and, further, to determine the functional relevance of NE in modulating endogenous Abeta42 levels. We report that endogenous Abeta42 is localized to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive somatodendritic profiles of the LC and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH) immunoreactive axon terminals of the infralimbic mPFC (ILmPFC). Male and female naive rats have similar levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage products demonstrated by western blot, as well as similar levels of endogenous Abeta42 as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two models of NE depletion, DSP-4 lesion and DbetaH knockout (KO) mice, were used to assess the functional relevance of NE on endogenous Abeta42 levels. DSP-4 lesioned rats and DbetaH-KO mice show significantly lower levels of endogenous Abeta42. Noradrenergic depletion did not change APP-cleavage products resulting from beta-secretase processing. Thus, resultant decreases in endogenous Abeta42 may be due to decreased neuronal activity of noradrenergic neurons, or, by decreased stimulation of adrenergic receptors which are known to contribute to Abeta42 production by enhancing gamma-secretase processing under normal physiological conditions.",Localization of endogenous amyloid-beta to the coeruleo-cortical pathway: consequences of noradrenergic depletion.
"The encapsulated and noninvasive follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma has been recently reclassified as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). These tumors demonstrate indolent behavior. This change in nomenclature will have great clinical impact by avoiding overtreatment of patients with NIFTP lesions who in the past were diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma and typically received completion thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine ablation. The pathologic diagnosis of NIFTP requires surgical removal of the thyroid lesion or the lobe harboring it, and thorough sampling of the complete interface between the tumor capsule and the thyroid parenchyma, to exclude foci of invasion. From a cytologic point of view, the unequivocal differential diagnosis between NIFTP and infiltrative follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma in fine-needle aspiration is close to impossible based on cellular and architectural features. Therefore, use of adjunct molecular testing on fine-needle aspiration specimens may be essential for the preoperative diagnosis of low-risk tumors such as NIFTP for appropriate patient management. This review discusses and summarizes the existing known literature on molecular characteristics of NIFTP tumors, so far reported, including cases retrospectively classified or prospectively diagnosed as NIFTP. Brief reference is also made to new and promising approaches applicable to the diagnosis of this tumor.",The Molecular Landscape of Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm With Papillary-like Nuclear Features (NIFTP): A Literature Review.

"Breastfeeding rates among mothers in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) are lower than for other mothers in the United States. The objective of this study was to test the acceptability and feasibility of the Lactation Advice thru Texting Can Help intervention. Mothers were enrolled at 18-30 weeks gestation from two WIC breastfeeding peer counselling (PC) programmes if they intended to breastfeed and had unlimited text messaging, more than fifth-grade literacy level, and fluency in English or Spanish. Participants were randomized to the control arm (PC support without texting) or the intervention arm (PC support with texting). The two-way texting intervention provided breastfeeding education and support from peer counsellors. Primary outcomes included early post-partum (PP) contact and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates at 2 weeks PP. Feasibility outcomes included text messaging engagement and mother's satisfaction with texting platform. Fifty-eight women were enrolled, 52 of whom were available for intention-to-treat analysis (n = 30 texting, n = 22 control). Contact between mothers and PCs within 48 hr of delivery was greater in the texting group (86.6% vs. 27.3%, p < .001). EBF rates at 2 weeks PP among participants in the texting intervention was 50% versus 31.8% in the control arm (p = .197). Intervention group mothers tended to be more likely to meet their breastfeeding goals (p = .06). Participants were highly satisfied with the Lactation Advice thru Texting Can Help intervention, and findings suggest that it may improve early post-delivery contact and increase EBF rates among mothers enrolled in WIC who receive PC. A large, multicentre trial is feasible and warranted.",Feasibility and acceptability of a text message intervention used as an adjunct tool by WIC breastfeeding peer counsellors: The LATCH pilot.
"Rare copy number variants contribute significantly to the risk for schizophrenia, with the 22q11.2 locus consistently implicated. Individuals with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) have an estimated 25-fold increased risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorders, compared to individuals in the general population. The International 22q11DS Brain Behavior Consortium is examining this highly informative neurogenetic syndrome phenotypically and genomically. Here we detail the procedures of the effort to characterize the neuropsychiatric and neurobehavioral phenotypes associated with 22q11DS, focusing on schizophrenia and subthreshold expression of psychosis. The genomic approach includes a combination of whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide microarray technologies, allowing the investigation of all possible DNA variation and gene pathways influencing the schizophrenia-relevant phenotypic expression. A phenotypically rich data set provides a psychiatrically well-characterized sample of unprecedented size (n=1616) that informs the neurobehavioral developmental course of 22q11DS. This combined set of phenotypic and genomic data will enable hypothesis testing to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders.",A neurogenetic model for the study of schizophrenia spectrum disorders: the International 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome Brain Behavior Consortium.
"INTRODUCTION: Youth exposed to trauma have an increased risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated sleep disturbances and nightmares. The alpha-1 antagonist prazosin reduces sleep disturbances and nightmares in adults with PTSD; however, its use in youth with PTSD has not been systematically evaluated. We retrospectively examined the tolerability and clinical outcomes associated with prazosin treatment in youth with PTSD-related nightmares and dysomnias. METHOD: A retrospective chart review identified youth with PTSD (N = 40) treated with prazosin between 2014 and 2016 in a trauma clinic. We assessed the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition scores (and sub-scores for intrusive, hyperarousal, avoidant and negative cognition/mood symptoms) and sleep scale, as well as adverse events and vital signs. Linear mixed effects models were utilized to evaluate the change in symptom severity, and vital signs were monitored throughout treatment. RESULT: Follow-up data were available for 34 patients with PTSD (mean age 13.4 +/- 2.9 years, 82% female), of whom 76% had a history of sexual abuse and 65% had at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder. The mean duration of prazosin treatment was 10.2 +/- 8.1 (range 2-30) weeks, and the mean number of follow-up visits was 3 +/- 1.23. Of these 34 patients, 79% received trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy. The dose range of prazosin was 1-15 mg at every bedtime (0.02-0.3 mg/kg), with 35% receiving >/=5 mg/day. Treatment-emergent side effects were reported by 26% (n = 8) of patients, including dizziness (18%), anxiety (9%) and headaches (6%). Prazosin treatment was associated with improved sleep and nightmares over time (pre-treatment 7.3 +/- 0.9, post-treatment 3.1 +/- 2.4; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Prazosin was well-tolerated and associated with improvements in nightmares and sleep in youth with PTSD. Adverse events were consistent with the known side-effect profile of prazosin and included dizziness and nausea.",Use of Prazosin for Pediatric PTSD-Associated Nightmares and Sleep Disturbances: A Retrospective Chart Review.
"Stress-induced sleep (SIS) in Caenorhabditis elegans is important for restoration of cellular homeostasis and is a useful model to study the function and regulation of sleep. SIS is triggered when epidermal growth factor (EGF) activates the ALA neuron, which then releases neuropeptides to promote sleep. To further understand this behavior, we established a new model of SIS using irradiation by ultraviolet C (UVC) light. While UVC irradiation requires ALA signaling and leads to a sleep state similar to that induced by heat and other stressors, it does not induce the proteostatic stress seen with heat exposure. Based on the known genotoxic effects of UVC irradiation, we tested two genes, atl-1 and cep-1, which encode proteins that act in the DNA damage response pathway. Loss-of-function mutants of atl-1 had no defect in UVC-induced SIS but a partial loss-of-function mutant of cep-1, gk138, had decreased movement quiescence following UVC irradiation. Germline ablation experiments and tissue-specific RNA interference experiments showed that cep-1 is required somatically in neurons for its effect on SIS. The cep-1(gk138) mutant suppressed body movement quiescence controlled by EGF, indicating that CEP-1 acts downstream or in parallel to ALA activation to promote quiescence in response to ultraviolet light.",Stress-Induced Sleep After Exposure to Ultraviolet Light Is Promoted by p53 in Caenorhabditis elegans.
"PurposeTo investigate whether the observed international differences in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) treatment rates within the Benefits of Oxygen Saturation Targeting (BOOST) II trials might have been caused by international variation in ROP disease grading.MethodsGroups of BOOST II trial ophthalmologists in UK, Australia, and New Zealand (ANZ), and an international reference group (INT) used a web based system to grade a selection of RetCam images of ROP acquired during the BOOST II UK trial. Rates of decisions to treat, plus disease grading, ROP stage grading, ROP zone grading, inter-observer variation within groups and intra-observer variation within groups were measured.ResultsForty-two eye examinations were graded. UK ophthalmologists diagnosed treat-requiring ROP more frequently than ANZ ophthalmologists, 13.9 (3.49) compared to 9.4 (4.46) eye examinations, P=0.038. UK ophthalmologists diagnosed plus disease more frequently than ANZ ophthalmologists, 14.1 (6.23) compared to 8.5 (3.24) eye examinations, P=0.021. ANZ ophthalmologists diagnosed stage 2 ROP more frequently than UK ophthalmologists, 20.2 (5.8) compared to 12.7 (7.1) eye examinations, P=0.026. There were no other significant differences in the grading of ROP stage or zone. Inter-observer variation was higher within the UK group than within the ANZ group. Intra-observer variation was low in both groups.ConclusionsWe have found evidence of international variation in the diagnosis of treatment-requiring ROP. Improved standardisation of the diagnosis of treatment-requiring ROP is required. Measures might include improved training in the grading of ROP, using an international approach, and further development of ROP image analysis software.",An international comparison of retinopathy of prematurity grading performance within the Benefits of Oxygen Saturation Targeting II trials.
"The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a central route for oxidative phosphorylation in cells, and fulfills their bioenergetic, biosynthetic, and redox balance requirements. Despite early dogma that cancer cells bypass the TCA cycle and primarily utilize aerobic glycolysis, emerging evidence demonstrates that certain cancer cells, especially those with deregulated oncogene and tumor suppressor expression, rely heavily on the TCA cycle for energy production and macromolecule synthesis. As the field progresses, the importance of aberrant TCA cycle function in tumorigenesis and the potentials of applying small molecule inhibitors to perturb the enhanced cycle function for cancer treatment start to evolve. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the fuels feeding the cycle, effects of oncogenes and tumor suppressors on fuel and cycle usage, common genetic alterations and deregulation of cycle enzymes, and potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting the TCA cycle in cancer cells. With the application of advanced technology and in vivo model organism studies, it is our hope that studies of this previously overlooked biochemical hub will provide fresh insights into cancer metabolism and tumorigenesis, subsequently revealing vulnerabilities for therapeutic interventions in various cancer types.",The emerging role and targetability of the TCA cycle in cancer metabolism.
"INTRODUCTION: Objective, portable measures of motor function for out-of-office assessments are needed in Parkinson's Disease (PD). This study had 3 objectives. First, to examine change in objective motor measurements in PD (as assessed with the Objective PD Measurement (OPDM) system). Second, to correlate objective measures with clinical features and putative PD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and dopaminergic imaging biomarkers. Third, to assess participant compliance with and perceptions of serial in-home motor assessments. METHODS: De novo PD subjects participating in this pilot study of the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) completed OPDM assessments at home weekly for 3 months and in the clinic at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-months. Tasks included (i)digitography (ii)a repetitive hand tapping task and (iii)timed pegboard task. A global objective motor score (OMS) was derived from the latter three. MDS-UPDRS-III score was obtained at each time point, and CSF and dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT at baseline. RESULTS: 27 participants, mean age 62.6 years, 19 male were included. A mean of 10.5 in-home assessments were completed. There was no significant change in in-home OMS over 12 weeks (p = 0.48). There was strong correlation between mean baseline OMS and MDS-UPDRS-III scores (spearman's rho = 0.60, p=<0.0001). Baseline OMS predicted 6-month MDS-UPDRS-III (beta = 0.80, p = 0.0002) but not change in MDS-UPDRS-III score, DAT SPECT, or putative CSF biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that administration of in-home motor tasks as part of a large multi-center study is feasible and scores derived from these assessments may serve as surrogates of in-person clinician-assessed motor score.",Portable objective assessment of upper extremity motor function in Parkinson's disease.
"AIM: Super absorbent polyvinyl alcohol-sodium acrylate copolymer microspheres, Quadrasphere microspheres (QSM), are commonly used for drug-eluting bead therapy, however, the literature only reports its use with small molecule chemotherapeutics. This study evaluates the loading and elution characteristics of bevacizumab-loaded QSM. METHODS & RESULTS: A single vial of QSM was reconstituted with 200 mg of bevacizumab. Drug concentration was determined by ELISA immunoassay. At approximately 90 min, there was maximal loading at 59% of the starting dose. In vitro elution demonstrated 52% of bound bevacizumab was released within the first hour and 68% by 16 h. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab can load onto QSM and elute over time.

"BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability worldwide with an incidence of 2.5 per 1,000 births globally. Health beliefs among caregivers may be major drivers of health-related behaviours and service utilization, but little is known regarding health beliefs around CP in Africa. METHODS: Between July 2013 and September 2015, children with CP were identified in Gaborone, Botswana, and their caregivers were invited to participate in a qualitative study utilizing semistructured in-person one-on-one interviews. Interview questions addressed their understanding of CP, challenges of caring for a handicapped child, and community response to children with CP. RESULTS: Sixty-two caregivers participated in the study. Common themes elicited were variable knowledge about CP, financial and physical burden, lack of therapies and educational resources, and the impact of stigma. Caregivers in Botswana generally subscribed to a biomedical explanation of CP but expressed concerns regarding more stigmatizing folks beliefs expressed in the community. CONCLUSION: Health beliefs regarding CP in Botswana likely have a significant impact on utilization of healthcare resources. Information from this study should inform future educational interventions for caregivers of children with CP.",Health beliefs regarding pediatric cerebral palsy among caregivers in Botswana: A qualitative study.
"BACKGROUND: Wake Up Safe is a quality improvement initiative of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia that contains a deidentified registry of serious adverse events occurring in pediatric anesthesia. The aim of this study was to describe and characterize reported medication errors to find common patterns amenable to preventative strategies. METHODS: In September 2016, we analyzed approximately 6 years' worth of medication error events reported to Wake Up Safe. Medication errors were classified by: (1) medication category; (2) error type by phase of administration: prescribing, preparation, or administration; (3) bolus or infusion error; (4) provider type and level of training; (5) harm as defined by the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention; and (6) perceived preventability. RESULTS: From 2010 to the time of our data analysis in September 2016, 32 institutions had joined and submitted data on 2087 adverse events during 2,316,635 anesthetics. These reports contained details of 276 medication errors, which comprised the third highest category of events behind cardiac and respiratory related events. Medication errors most commonly involved opioids and sedative/hypnotics. When categorized by phase of handling, 30 events occurred during preparation, 67 during prescribing, and 179 during administration. The most common error type was accidental administration of the wrong dose (N = 84), followed by syringe swap (accidental administration of the wrong syringe, N = 49). Fifty-seven (21%) reported medication errors involved medications prepared as infusions as opposed to 1 time bolus administrations. Medication errors were committed by all types of anesthesia providers, most commonly by attendings. Over 80% of reported medication errors reached the patient and more than half of these events caused patient harm. Fifteen events (5%) required a life sustaining intervention. Nearly all cases (97%) were judged to be either likely or certainly preventable. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings characterize the most common types of medication errors in pediatric anesthesia practice and provide guidance on future preventative strategies. Many of these errors will be almost entirely preventable with the use of prefilled medication syringes to avoid accidental ampule swap, bar-coding at the point of medication administration to prevent syringe swap and to confirm the proper dose, and 2-person checking of medication infusions for accuracy.",Medication Errors in Pediatric Anesthesia: A Report From the Wake Up Safe Quality Improvement Initiative.
"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis hospitalizations are frequently followed by hospital readmissions, often for recurrent sepsis. However, it is unclear how often sepsis readmissions are for relapsed/recrudescent versus new infections. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which 90-day readmissions for recurrent sepsis are due to infection of the same site and same pathogen as the initial episode. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University of Michigan Health System. PATIENTS: All hospitalizations (May 15, 2013 to May 14, 2015) with a principal International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis of septicemia (038.x), severe sepsis (995.92), or septic shock (785.52), as well as all subsequent hospitalizations and sepsis readmissions within 90 days. We determined organism and site of sepsis through manual chart abstraction. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 472 readmissions within 90 days of sepsis, of which 137 (29.1%) were for sepsis. In sepsis readmissions, the site and organisms were most commonly urinary (29.2%), gastrointestinal (20.4%), Gram negative (29.9%), Gram positive (16.8%), and culture negative (30.7%). Ninety-four readmissions (68.6%) were for infection at the same site as initial sepsis hospitalization. Nineteen percent of readmissions were confirmed to be same site and same organism. However, accounting for the uncertainty from culture-negative sepsis, as many as 53.2% of readmissions could plausibly due to infections with both the same organism and same site. CONCLUSIONS: Of the patients readmitted with sepsis within 90 days, two thirds had infection at the same site as their initial admission. Just 19% had infection confirmed to be from the same site and organism as the initial sepsis hospitalization. Half of readmissions were definitively for new infections, whereas an additional 34% were unclear since cultures were negative in one of the hospitalizations.",Readmissions for Recurrent Sepsis: New or Relapsed Infection?
"Previous event-related potential (ERP) research utilizing oddball stimulus paradigms suggests diminished processing of speech versus non-speech sounds in children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, brain mechanisms underlying these speech processing abnormalities, and to what extent they are related to poor language abilities in this population remain unknown. In the current study, we utilized a novel paired repetition paradigm in order to investigate ERP responses associated with the detection and discrimination of speech and non-speech sounds in 4- to 6-year old children with ASD, compared with gender and verbal age matched controls. ERPs were recorded while children passively listened to pairs of stimuli that were either both speech sounds, both non-speech sounds, speech followed by non-speech, or non-speech followed by speech. Control participants exhibited N330 match/mismatch responses measured from temporal electrodes, reflecting speech versus non-speech detection, bilaterally, whereas children with ASD exhibited this effect only over temporal electrodes in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, while the control groups exhibited match/mismatch effects at approximately 600 ms (central N600, temporal P600) when a non-speech sound was followed by a speech sound, these effects were absent in the ASD group. These findings suggest that children with ASD fail to activate right hemisphere mechanisms, likely associated with social or emotional aspects of speech detection, when distinguishing non-speech from speech stimuli. Together, these results demonstrate the presence of atypical speech versus non-speech processing in children with ASD when compared with typically developing children matched on verbal age.",Atypical speech versus non-speech detection and discrimination in 4- to 6- yr old children with autism spectrum disorder: An ERP study.
"OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to identify risk factors for acute kidney injury in children surviving cardiac arrest. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a public access dataset. SETTING: Fifteen children's hospitals associated with the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. PATIENTS: Two hundred ninety-six subjects between 1 day and 18 years old who experienced in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between July 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our primary outcome was development of acute kidney injury as defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria. An ordinal probit model was developed. We found six critical explanatory variables, including total number of epinephrine doses, postcardiac arrest blood pressure, arrest location, presence of a chronic lung condition, pH, and presence of an abnormal baseline creatinine. Total number of epinephrine doses received as well as rate of epinephrine dosing impacted acute kidney injury risk and severity of acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify risk factors for acute kidney injury in children after cardiac arrest. Our findings regarding the impact of epinephrine dosing are of particular interest and suggest potential for epinephrine toxicity with regard to acute kidney injury. The ability to identify and potentially modify risk factors for acute kidney injury after cardiac arrest may lead to improved morbidity and mortality in this population.",Identifying Risk for Acute Kidney Injury in Infants and Children Following Cardiac Arrest.
"Historically, the diagnosis and classification of acute leukemia involved morphologic review of blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow smears and cytochemical staining. Cytochemical stains, which are enzymatic colorimetric reactions that occur in the cells of interest, were necessary to assign and confirm myeloid and lymphoid lineage. In the current WHO 2008 Classification of leukemia, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic analysis have largely replaced cytochemical staining in the characterization of acute leukemias. Nonetheless, cytochemical testing remains a useful adjunct assay for the proper classification of acute leukemia in a number of diagnostic settings. This chapter reviews the principles of the most common cytochemical stains, their procedures and guides to interpretation, and results in acute myeloid leukemia.",Cytochemical Staining.
"OBJECTIVE: Although individual neonatal epilepsy syndromes are rare, as a group they represent a sizable subgroup of neonatal seizure etiologies. We evaluated the profile of neonatal epilepsies in a prospective cohort of newborns with seizures. METHODS: Consecutive newborns with seizures were enrolled in the Neonatal Seizure Registry (an association of 7 US children's hospitals). Treatment and diagnostic testing were at the clinicians' discretion. Neonates with seizures related to epileptic encephalopathies (without structural brain abnormalities), brain malformations, or benign familial epilepsies were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Among 611 consecutive newborns with seizures, 79 (13%) had epilepsy (35 epileptic encephalopathy, 32 congenital brain malformations, 11 benign familial neonatal epilepsy [BFNE], 1 benign neonatal seizures). Twenty-nine (83%) with epileptic encephalopathy had genetic testing and 24/29 (83%) had a genetic etiology. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic KCNQ2 variants (n = 10) were the most commonly identified etiology of epileptic encephalopathy. Among 23 neonates with brain malformations who had genetic testing, 7 had putative genetic etiologies. Six infants with BFNE had genetic testing; 3 had pathogenic KCNQ2 variants and 1 had a pathogenic KCNQ3 variant. Comorbid illnesses that predisposed to acute symptomatic seizures occurred in 3/35 neonates with epileptic encephalopathy vs 10/32 with brain malformations (p = 0.03). Death or discharge to hospice were more common among newborns with brain malformations (11/32) than those with epileptic encephalopathy (3/35, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal epilepsy is often due to identifiable genetic causes. Genetic testing is now warranted for newborns with epilepsy in order to guide management and inform discussions of prognosis.",Profile of neonatal epilepsies: Characteristics of a prospective US cohort.
"A companion diagnostic is a test for a specific biomarker-approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration-qualifying a patient to receive a specific, associated therapy. As interest has grown in precision medicine over the past decade, the principle of companion diagnostics has gained increasing purchase among laboratory professionals, clinicians, regulators, and even patients. The evolution of the biomarkers used to stratify and treat breast cancer illustrates the history of companion diagnostics and provides a lens through which to examine potential challenges. As new targeted therapies and corresponding biomarkers accumulate, algorithms for diagnosis and treatment necessarily become lengthier and more complex. To accommodate future needs of breast cancer patients, the companion diagnostic model will continue to adapt and evolve.",The Evolving Role of Companion Diagnostics for Breast Cancer in an Era of Next-Generation Omics.

"The kinesin family proteins are often studied as prototypical molecular motors; a deeper understanding of them can illuminate regulation of intracellular transport. It is typically assumed that they function identically. Here we find that this assumption of homogeneous function appears incorrect: variation among motors' velocities in vivo and in vitro is larger than the stochastic variation expected for an ensemble of ""identical"" motors. When moving on microtubules, slow and fast motors are persistently slow, and fast, respectively. We develop theory that provides quantitative criteria to determine whether the observed single-molecule variation is too large to be generated from an ensemble of identical molecules. To analyze such heterogeneity, we group traces into homogeneous sub-ensembles. Motility studies varying the temperature, pH and glycerol concentration suggest at least 2 distinct functional states that are independently affected by external conditions. We end by investigating the functional ramifications of such heterogeneity through Monte-Carlo multi-motor simulations.",Heterogeneity in kinesin function.
"INTRODUCTION: Existing methods to predict recipient allograft function during deceased-donor kidney procurement are imprecise. Understanding the potential renal reparative role for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a cytokine involved in macrophage recruitment after injury, might help predict allograft outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a sub-study of the multicenter prospective Deceased Donor Study cohort, which evaluated deceased kidney donors from five organ procurement organizations from May 2010 to December 2013. We measured urine MCP-1 (uMCP-1) concentrations from donor samples collected at nephrectomy to determine associations with donor acute kidney injury (AKI), recipient delayed graft function (DGF), 6-month estimated GFR (eGFR), and graft failure. We also assessed perfusate MCP-1 concentrations from pumped kidneys for associations with DGF and 6-month eGFR. RESULTS: AKI occurred in 111 (9%) donors. Median (interquartile range) uMCP-1 concentration was higher in donors with AKI compared to donors without AKI (1.35 [0.41-3.93] ng/ml vs. 0.32 [0.11-0.80] ng/ml, p<0.001). DGF occurred in 756 (31%) recipients, but uMCP-1 was not independently associated with DGF. Higher donor uMCP-1 concentrations were independently associated with higher 6-month eGFR in those without DGF [0.77 (0.10, 1.45) ml/min/1.73m(2) per doubling of uMCP1]. However, there were no independent associations between uMCP-1 and graft failure over a median follow-up of about 2 years. Lastly, perfusate MCP-1 concentrations significantly increased during pump perfusion but were not associated with DGF or 6-month eGFR. CONCLUSION: Donor uMCP-1 concentrations were modestly associated with higher recipient 6-month eGFR in those without DGF. However, the results suggest that donor uMCP-1 has minimal clinical utility given no associations with graft failure.",Associations between Deceased-Donor Urine MCP-1 and Kidney Transplant Outcomes.

"PURPOSE: This study aimed to characterize the sociodemographic characteristics of sexual minority (i.e., gay, lesbian, bisexual) adults and compare sexual minority and heterosexual populations on nine Healthy People 2020 leading health indicators (LHIs). METHODS: Using a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey (National Health Interview Survey 2013-2015) of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population (228,893,944 adults), nine Healthy People 2020 LHIs addressing health behaviors and access to care, stratified using a composite variable of sex (female, male) and sexual orientation (gay or lesbian, bisexual, heterosexual), were analyzed individually and in aggregate. RESULTS: In 2013-2015, sexual minority adults represented 2.4% of the U.S. POPULATION: Compared to heterosexuals, sexual minorities were more likely to be younger and to have never married. Gays and lesbians were more likely to have earned a graduate degree. Gay males were more likely to have a usual primary care provider, but gay/lesbian females were less likely than heterosexuals to have a usual primary care provider and health insurance. Gay males received more colorectal cancer screening than heterosexual males. Gay males, gay/lesbian females, and bisexual females were more likely to be current smokers than their sex-matched, heterosexual counterparts. Binge drinking was more common in bisexuals compared to heterosexuals. Sexual minority females were more likely to be obese than heterosexual females; the converse was true for gay males. Sexual minorities underwent more HIV testing than their heterosexual peers, but bisexual males were less likely than gay males to be tested. Gay males were more likely to meet all eligible LHIs than heterosexual males. Overall, more sexual minority adults met all eligible LHIs compared to heterosexual adults. Similar results were found regardless of HIV testing LHI inclusion. CONCLUSION: Differences between sexual minorities and heterosexuals suggest the need for targeted health assessments and public health interventions aimed at reducing specific negative health behaviors.","Sociodemographic Characteristics and Health Outcomes Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual U.S. Adults Using Healthy People 2020 Leading Health Indicators."

"We examined burden and factors associated with norovirus (NoV) acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among children in rural Guatemala. Children age 6 weeks to 17 years were enrolled into three AGE surveillance groups, using two-stage cluster sampling: a prospective participatory syndromic surveillance (PSS) cohort and two cross-sectional rapid active sampling (RAS) surveys, conducted from April 2015 to February 2016. Epidemiologic and NoV testing data were used to identify factors associated with NoV infection, AGE, and NoV+ AGE. The three cross-sectional surveys (PSS enrollment visit, RAS Survey 1, and RAS Survey 2) enrolled 1,239 children, who reported 134 (11%) AGE cases, with 20% of AGE and 11% of non-AGE samples positive for NoV. Adjusted analyses identified several modifiable factors associated with AGE and NoV infection. The cross-sectional RAS surveys were practical and cost-effective in identifying population-level risk factors for AGE and NoV, supporting their use as a tool to direct limited public health resources toward high-risk populations.",Rapid Active Sampling Surveys as a Tool to Evaluate Factors Associated with Acute Gastroenteritis and Norovirus Infection among Children in Rural Guatemala.
"Extracellular phosphorylation of proteins was suggested in the late 1800s when it was demonstrated that casein contains phosphate. More recently, extracellular kinases that phosphorylate extracellular serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of numerous proteins have been identified. However, the functional significance of extracellular phosphorylation of specific residues in the nervous system is poorly understood. Here we show that synaptic accumulation of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and pathological pain are controlled by ephrin-B-induced extracellular phosphorylation of a single tyrosine (p*Y504) in a highly conserved region of the fibronectin type III (FN3) domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2. Ligand-dependent Y504 phosphorylation modulates the EphB-NMDAR interaction in cortical and spinal cord neurons. Furthermore, Y504 phosphorylation enhances NMDAR localization and injury-induced pain behavior. By mediating inducible extracellular interactions that are capable of modulating animal behavior, extracellular tyrosine phosphorylation of EphBs may represent a previously unknown class of mechanism mediating protein interaction and function.",Extracellular phosphorylation of a receptor tyrosine kinase controls synaptic localization of NMDA receptors and regulates pathological pain.
"Until recently, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was the only curative option for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). The first attempts at gene therapy for WAS using a Upsilon-retroviral vector improved immunological parameters substantially but were complicated by acute leukemia as a result of insertional mutagenesis in a high proportion of patients. More recently, treatment of children with a state-of-the-art self-inactivating lentiviral vector (LV-w1.6 WASp) has resulted in significant clinical benefit without inducing selection of clones harboring integrations near oncogenes. Here, we describe a case of a presplenectomized 30-year-old patient with severe WAS manifesting as cutaneous vasculitis, inflammatory arthropathy, intermittent polyclonal lymphoproliferation, and significant chronic kidney disease and requiring long-term immunosuppressive treatment. Following reduced-intensity conditioning, there was rapid engraftment and expansion of a polyclonal pool of transgene-positive functional T cells and sustained gene marking in myeloid and B-cell lineages up to 20 months of observation. The patient was able to discontinue immunosuppression and exogenous immunoglobulin support, with improvement in vasculitic disease and proinflammatory markers. Autologous gene therapy using a lentiviral vector is a viable strategy for adult WAS patients with severe chronic disease complications and for whom an allogeneic procedure could present an unacceptable risk.

"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Psychiatric concerns are a common presenting problem for pediatric providers across many settings, particularly on inpatient medical services. The volume of youth requiring intensive psychiatric treatment outnumbers the availability of psychiatric placements, and as a result many youth must board on pediatric medical units while awaiting placement. As the phenomenon of boarding in the inpatient pediatric setting increases, it is important to understand trends in boarding volume and characteristics of pediatric psychiatric boarders (PBs) and understand the supports they receive while boarding. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients admitted as PBs to a medical inpatient unit at a large northeastern US pediatric hospital during 2013. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-seven PBs were admitted to the medical service from January to December 2013, representing a more than 50% increase from PB admissions in 2011 and 2012. Most PBs were admitted for suicidal attempt and/or ideation. Average length of boarding was 3.11 +/- 3.34 days. PBs received a wide range of mental health supports throughout their admissions. PBs demonstrated modest but statistically significant clinical improvements over the course of their stay, with only a small proportion demonstrating clinical deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric boarding presents many challenges for families, providers, and the health care system, and PBs have complex psychiatric histories and needs. However, boarding may offer a valuable opportunity for psychiatric intervention and stabilization among psychiatrically vulnerable youth.",Psychiatric Boarding in the Pediatric Inpatient Medical Setting: A Retrospective Analysis.

"BACKGROUND: Blood transfusions are a common and costly intervention for cardiac surgery patients. Evidence suggests that a more restrictive transfusion strategy may reduce costs and transfusion-related complications without increasing perioperative morbidity and mortality. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A transfusion-limiting protocol was developed and implemented in a cardiovascular surgery unit. Over a 5-year period, data were collected on patient characteristics, procedures, utilization of blood products, morbidity, and mortality, and these were compared before and after the protocol was implemented. RESULTS: After the protocol was put in place, fewer patients required transfusions (38.2% vs. 45.5%, p = 0.004), with the greatest reduction observed in postoperative blood use (29.1% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.001). In-hospital morbidity and mortality did not increase. When patients who received transfusions were stratified by procedure, the protocol was most effective in reducing transfusions for patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; 4.09 units vs. 2.51 units, p = 0.009) and CABG plus valve surgery (10.32 units vs. 4.77 units, p = 0.014). A small group of patients were disproportionate recipients of transfusions, with approximately 6% of all patients receiving approximately half of the blood products. CONCLUSION: A protocol to limit transfusions decreased the proportion of cardiothoracic surgery patients who received blood products. A very small group of patients received a large number of transfusions, and within that group the observed mortality was significantly higher than in the general patient population. Current protocols cannot possibly account for these patients, and this should be considered when analyzing the performance of protocols designed to reduce unnecessary transfusions.",Implementing a protocol to optimize blood use in a cardiac surgery service: results of a pre-post analysis and the impact of high-volume blood users.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this paper is to review the current management and prevention of post-operative complications after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Trends in rehabilitation techniques will be presented, in addition to suggestions for interventions and expected milestones in ACL reconstruction recovery. RECENT FINDINGS: ACL reconstruction protocols have evolved to more of a criterion-based progression rather than a tissue-healing time frame. Given the evolution of ACL surgical reconstruction techniques and rehabilitation protocols, the risk of post-operative complications can arise both early and late in the recovery process. This paper will discuss the role of preventative measures as it applies to the post-operative patient with ACL reconstruction. Short-term complications following ACL reconstruction include infection and deficits to knee motion and strength, whereas long-term complications include secondary ACL injury to either the involved or contralateral knee and lack of ability to return to high-level sports following this procedure. Future research should continue to address the multifactorial causes of secondary ACL injury and limited ability of patients to return to high level activities.",Prevention and Management of Post-operative Complications Following ACL Reconstruction.
"BACKGROUND: Medication adherence is a critical but challenging developmental task for children and adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV). Understanding how medication responsibility, executive functions (EFs) and adaptive functioning (AF) influence adherence may help prepare adolescents for transition to adulthood. METHODS: Participants included PHIV children and adolescents 7-16 years of age enrolled in the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study Adolescent Master Protocol, who were prescribed antiretroviral medications. Measures included caregiver report and child self-report measures of adherence, medication responsibility and EF, caregiver report of child AF, examiner-administered tests of EF and processing speed and demographic and health characteristics. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-six participants with PHIV (mean age: 12 years old) were 51% female, 80% black and 79% non-Hispanic. Per 7-day recall, 72% were adherent (no missed doses). Children/adolescents self-reported that 22% had sole and 55% had shared medication responsibility. Adjusted logistic models revealed significantly higher odds of adherence with sole caregiver responsibility for medication [odds ratio (OR): 4.10, confidence interval (CI): 1.43-11.8, P = 0.009], child nadir CD4% <15% (OR: 2.26, CI: 1.15-4.43, P = 0.018), better self-reported behavioral regulation (OR: 0.65, CI: 0.44-0.96, P = 0.029) and slower processing speed (OR: 0.54, CI: 0.38-0.77, P < 0.001), adjusting for demographic variables (age, race and caregiver education). CONCLUSIONS: Among children and adolescents with PHIV, continued caregiver medication management, especially during adolescence, is essential. Although global EF and AF were not significantly associated with adherence, behavioral regulation was. Given that EF and AF develop throughout adolescence, their relationships to adherence should be evaluated longitudinally, especially as youth transition to adulthood and caregiver responsibility diminishes.","Roles of Medication Responsibility, Executive and Adaptive Functioning in Adherence for Children and Adolescents With Perinatally Acquired HIV."

"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) after major vascular injury (MVI) is particularly challenging because the competing risk of thrombosis and embolization after direct vessel injury must be balanced with risk of bleeding after surgical repair. We hypothesized that venous injuries, repair type, and intraoperative anticoagulation would influence VTE formation after MVI. METHODS: A multi-institution, retrospective cohort study of consecutive MVI patients was conducted at three urban, Level I centers (2005-2013). Patients with MVI of the neck, torso, or proximal extremities (to elbows/knees) were included. Our primary study endpoint was the development of VTE (DVT or pulmonary embolism [PE]). RESULTS: The 435 major vascular injury patients were primarily young (27 years) men (89%) with penetrating (84%) injuries. When patients with (n = 108) and without (n = 327) VTE were compared, we observed no difference in age, mechanism, extremity injury, tourniquet use, orthopedic and spine injuries, damage control, local heparinized saline, or vascular surgery consultation (all p > 0.05). VTE patients had greater Injury Severity Score (ISS) (17 vs. 12), shock indices (1 vs. 0.9), and more torso (58% vs. 35%) and venous (73% vs. 48%) injuries, but less often received systemic intraoperative anticoagulation (39% vs. 53%) or postoperative enoxaparin (47% vs. 61%) prophylaxis (all p < 0.05). After controlling for ISS, hemodynamics, injured vessel, intraoperative anticoagulation, and postoperative prophylaxis, multivariable analysis revealed venous injury was independently predictive of VTE (odds ratio, 2.7; p = 0.002). Multivariable analysis of the venous injuries subset (n = 237) then determined that only delay in starting VTE chemoprophylaxis (odds ratio, 1.3/day; p = 0.013) independently predicted VTE after controlling for ISS, hemodynamics, injured vessel, surgical subspecialty, intraoperative anticoagulation, and postoperative prophylaxis. Overall, 3.4% of venous injury patients developed PE, but PE rates were not related to their operative management (p = 0.72). CONCLUSION: Patients with major venous injuries are at high risk for VTE, regardless of intraoperative management. Our results support the immediate initiation of postoperative chemoprophylaxis in patients with major venous injuries.

"OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between cytochrome p450 2B6 genotypes and efavirenz-based HIV treatment outcomes. DESIGN: Observational cohort study of HIV-infected adults initiating efavirenz-based regimens in Botswana. METHODS: The primary endpoint was a composite of death or loss to care or HIV RNA more than 25 copies/ml at 6 months. CYP2B6 516G>T and 983T>C genotyping was done with Taqman Open Array platform. Adverse experiences were measured by using the Subject Experience Questionnaire. Metabolism alleles were included in logistic regression models of the composite endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 801 individuals included 406 (51%) men, median age 37 years, median baseline CD4 cell count 195 cells/mul, and plasma HIV RNA 4.9 log10 copies/ml. 288 (36%) reached the endpoint, including 34 (4%) deaths, 151 (19%) lost to care, 11 (1%) lost to the study, but alive and in care, and 92 (11%) with plasma HIV RNA more than 25 copies/ml. Metabolism variant alleles were common with 396 (49%) intermediate and 192 (24%) slow metabolizers. There were no statistically significant associations between metabolism and treatment endpoints. However, slower metabolism was associated with fewer adverse experiences. CONCLUSION: Slow metabolism alleles were associated with lower efavirenz clearance but not any of the treatment endpoints. Slow efavirenz metabolism did not exacerbate central nervous system toxicity. These results should allay concern that slow efavirenz metabolism adversely impacts individuals in sub-Saharan African settings in which these alleles are common.",CYP2B6 genotypes and early efavirenz-based HIV treatment outcomes in Botswana.
"This document represents the first collaboration between two organizations, American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, to describe best practices in nutrition therapy in critically ill children. The target of these guidelines is intended to be the pediatric (> 1 mo and < 18 yr) critically ill patient expected to require a length of stay greater than 2 or 3 days in a PICU admitting medical, surgical, and cardiac patients. In total, 2,032 citations were scanned for relevance. The PubMed/Medline search resulted in 960 citations for clinical trials and 925 citations for cohort studies. The EMBASE search for clinical trials culled 1,661 citations. In total, the search for clinical trials yielded 1,107 citations, whereas the cohort search yielded 925. After careful review, 16 randomized controlled trials and 37 cohort studies appeared to answer one of the eight preidentified question groups for this guideline. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria to adjust the evidence grade based on assessment of the quality of study design and execution. These guidelines are not intended for neonates or adult patients. The guidelines reiterate the importance of nutritional assessment, particularly the detection of malnourished patients who are most vulnerable and therefore potentially may benefit from timely intervention. There is a need for renewed focus on accurate estimation of energy needs and attention to optimizing protein intake. Indirect calorimetry, where feasible, and cautious use of estimating equations and increased surveillance for unintended caloric underfeeding and overfeeding are recommended. Optimal protein intake and its correlation with clinical outcomes are areas of great interest. The optimal route and timing of nutrient delivery is an area of intense debate and investigations. Enteral nutrition remains the preferred route for nutrient delivery. Several strategies to optimize enteral nutrition during critical illness have emerged. The role of supplemental parenteral nutrition has been highlighted, and a delayed approach appears to be beneficial. Immunonutrition cannot be currently recommended. Overall, the pediatric critical care population is heterogeneous, and a nuanced approach to individualizing nutrition support with the aim of improving clinical outcomes is necessary.",Guidelines for the Provision and Assessment of Nutrition Support Therapy in the Pediatric Critically Ill Patient: Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.
"Introduction: Burnout is prevalent among medical trainees and faculty. Resilience, the ability to cope well with stress and thrive during challenges, has been a focus of initiatives to combat burnout. However, curricula teaching resilience skills are needed. Since residents experience challenging and stressful clinical events often, and would like to discuss these events with their teams, resilience skills may help trainees cope after such events. Additionally, resilience skills may help trainees address other challenges they face as team leaders. Leadership training is an important component of physician professional development. Methods: This advanced resilience training curriculum consists of two interactive workshops that include didactics, skills practice, and reflection. The first workshop focuses on applying resilience skills to team leadership, while the second focuses on structured team debriefing after difficult clinical events. This curriculum is intended for learners who are health care team leaders, such as senior residents, fellows, or faculty. It may be used with learners who have completed introductory resilience training or with those without prior training. Results: The curriculum was rated highly by senior residents, who reported feeling more comfortable leading their teams after difficult clinical events and talking about these events following this curriculum. The majority of residents thought the workshops should be continued. Discussion: This novel curriculum teaches learners to apply resilience skills during team leadership and difficult clinical scenarios. It was well received by senior residents and may be used with a variety of learners across health professions and training levels.",Building Team Resilience and Debriefing After Difficult Clinical Events: A Resilience Curriculum for Team Leaders.

A newly emerging research framework, developmental connectomics, provides unprecedented opportunities for exploring the developing brain through non-invasive mapping of structural and functional connectivity patterns. Within this framework, we review recent neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies investigating connectome development from 20 postmenstrual weeks to 5 years of age. Specifically, we highlight five fundamental principles of brain network development during the critical first years of life, emphasizing strengthened segregation/integration balance, a remarkable hierarchical order from primary to higher-order regions, unparalleled structural and functional maturations, substantial individual variability, and high vulnerability to risk factors and developmental disorders.",Developmental Connectomics from Infancy through Early Childhood.
"OBJECTIVE: To provide ICU clinicians with evidence-based guidance on tested interventions that reduce or prevent alert fatigue within clinical decision support systems. DESIGN: Systematic review of PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS, and CINAHL for relevant literature from 1966 to February 2017. PATIENTS: Focus on critically ill patients and included evaluations in other patient care settings, as well. INTERVENTIONS: Identified interventions designed to reduce or prevent alert fatigue within clinical decision support systems. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Study selection was based on one primary key question to identify effective interventions that attempted to reduce alert fatigue and three secondary key questions that covered the negative effects of alert fatigue, potential unintended consequences of efforts to reduce alert fatigue, and ideal alert quantity. Data were abstracted by two reviewers independently using a standardized abstraction tool. Surveys, meeting abstracts, ""gray"" literature, studies not available in English, and studies with non-original data were excluded. For the primary key question, articles were excluded if they did not provide a comparator as key question 1 was designed as a problem, intervention, comparison, and outcome question. We anticipated that reduction in alert fatigue, including the concept of desensitization may not be directly measured and thus considered interventions that reduced alert quantity as a surrogate marker for alert fatigue. Twenty-six articles met the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSION: Approaches for managing alert fatigue in the ICU are provided as a result of reviewing tested interventions that reduced alert quantity with the anticipated effect of reducing fatigue. Suggested alert management strategies include prioritizing alerts, developing sophisticated alerts, customizing commercially available alerts, and including end user opinion in alert selection. Alert fatigue itself is studied less frequently, as an outcome, and there is a need for more precise evaluation. Standardized metrics for alert fatigue is needed to advance the field.

"OBJECTIVE: A systematic review on S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) for treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions and comorbid medical conditions. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases between July 15, 2015, and September 28, 2016, by combining search terms for SAMe (s-adenosyl methionine or s-adenosyl-l-methionine) with terms for relevant disease states (major depressive disorder, MDD, depression, perinatal depression, human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, dementia, anxiety, schizophrenia, psychotic, 22q11.2, substance abuse, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, hepatitis, or cirrhosis). Additional studies were identified from prior literature. Ongoing clinical trials were identified through clinical trial registries. STUDY SELECTION: Of the 174 records retrieved, 21 were excluded, as they were not original investigations. An additional 21 records were excluded for falling outside the scope of this review. Of the 132 studies included in this review, 115 were clinical trials and 17 were preclinical studies. DATA EXTRACTION: A wide range of studies was included in this review to capture information that would be of interest to psychiatrists in clinical practice. RESULTS: This review of SAMe in the treatment of major depressive disorder found promising but limited evidence of efficacy and safety to support its use as a monotherapy and as an augmentation for other antidepressants. Additionally, preliminary evidence suggests that SAMe may ameliorate symptoms in certain neurocognitive, substance use, and psychotic disorders and comorbid medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: S-adenosylmethionine holds promise as a treatment for multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, but the body of evidence has limitations. The encouraging findings support further study of SAMe in both psychiatric and comorbid medical illnesses.",S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) for Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Clinician-Oriented Review of Research.
"Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by epileptic seizures, severe intellectual disability, and autistic features. Mice lacking CDKL5 display multiple behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of the disorder, but the cellular origins of these phenotypes remain unclear. Here, we find that ablating CDKL5 expression specifically from forebrain glutamatergic neurons impairs hippocampal-dependent memory in male conditional knock-out mice. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons lacking CDKL5 show decreased dendritic complexity but a trend toward increased spine density. This morphological change is accompanied by an increase in the frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs and interestingly, miniature IPSCs. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging to interrogate the evoked response of the CA1 microcircuit, we find that CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking CDKL5 show hyperexcitability in their dendritic domain that is constrained by elevated inhibition in a spatially and temporally distinct manner. These results suggest a novel role for CDKL5 in the regulation of synaptic function and uncover an intriguing microcircuit mechanism underlying impaired learning and memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the CDKL5 gene. Although Cdkl5 constitutive knock-out mice have recapitulated key aspects of human symptomatology, the cellular origins of CDKL5 deficiency-related phenotypes are unknown. Here, using conditional knock-out mice, we show that hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits in CDKL5 deficiency have origins in glutamatergic neurons of the forebrain and that loss of CDKL5 results in the enhancement of synaptic transmission and disruptions in neural circuit dynamics in a spatially and temporally specific manner. Our findings demonstrate that CDKL5 is an important regulator of synaptic function in glutamatergic neurons and serves a critical role in learning and memory.",Loss of CDKL5 in Glutamatergic Neurons Disrupts Hippocampal Microcircuitry and Leads to Memory Impairment in Mice.
"In the 50 years since acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first described, substantial progress has been made in identifying the risk factors for and the pathogenic contributors to the syndrome and in characterising the protein expression patterns in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ARDS. Despite this effort, however, pharmacological options for ARDS remain scarce. Frequently cited reasons for this absence of specific drug therapies include the heterogeneity of patients with ARDS, the potential for a differential response to drugs, and the possibility that the wrong targets have been studied. Advances in applied biomolecular technology and bioinformatics have enabled breakthroughs for other complex traits, such as cardiovascular disease or asthma, particularly when a precision medicine paradigm, wherein a biomarker or gene expression pattern indicates a patient's likelihood of responding to a treatment, has been pursued. In this Review, we consider the biological and analytical techniques that could facilitate a precision medicine approach for ARDS.",Novel translational approaches to the search for precision therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"BACKGROUND: RUNX1 haplodeficiency is associated with thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction and a predisposition to acute leukaemia. Platelets possess three distinct types of granules and secretory processes involving dense granules (DG), alpha-granules and vesicles or lysosomes containing acid hydrolases (AH). Dense granules and granule deficiencies have been reported in patients with RUNX1 mutations. Little is known regarding the secretion from AH-containing vesicles. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied two related patients with a RUNX1 mutation, easy bruising, and mild thrombocytopenia. Platelet aggregation and (14) C serotonin in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) were impaired in response to ADP, epinephrine, collagen and arachidonic acid. Contents of DG (ATP, ADP), alpha-granules (beta-thromboglobulin) and AH-containing vesicles (beta-glucuronidase, beta-hexosaminidase, alpha-mannosidase) were normal or minimally decreased. Dense granules secretion on stimulation of gel-filtered platelets with thrombin and divalent ionophore A23187 (4-12 mumol L(-1) ) were diminished. beta-thromboglobulin and AH secretion was impaired in response to thrombin or A23187. We studied thromboxane-related pathways. The incorporation of (14) C -arachidonic acid into phospholipids and subsequent arachidonic acid release on thrombin activation was normal. Platelet thromboxane A2 production in whole blood serum and on thrombin stimulation of PRP was normal, suggesting that the defective secretion was not due to impaired thromboxane production. CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide the first evidence in patients with a RUNX1 mutation for a defect in AH (lysosomal) secretion, and for a global defect in secretion involving all three types of platelet granules that is unrelated to a granule content deficiency. They highlight the pleiotropic effects and multiple platelet defects associated with RUNX1 mutations.",Defective acid hydrolase secretion in RUNX1 haplodeficiency: Evidence for a global platelet secretory defect.
"PURPOSE: The authors sought to compare the clinical outcomes of simultaneous versus sequential ptosis and strabismus surgery in children. METHODS: Retrospective, single-center cohort study of children requiring both ptosis and strabismus surgery on the same eye. Simultaneous surgeries were performed during a single anesthetic event; sequential surgeries were performed at least 7 weeks apart. Outcomes were ptosis surgery success (margin reflex distance 1 >/= 2 mm, good eyelid contour, and good eyelid crease); strabismus surgery success (ocular alignment within 10 prism diopters of orthophoria and/or improved head position); surgical complications; and reoperations. RESULTS: Fifty-six children were studied, 38 had simultaneous surgery and 18 sequential. Strabismus surgery was performed first in 38/38 simultaneous and 6/18 sequential cases. Mean age at first surgery was 64 months, with mean follow up 27 months. A total of 75% of children had congenital ptosis; 64% had comitant strabismus. A majority of ptosis surgeries were frontalis sling (59%) or Fasanella-Servat (30%) procedures. There were no significant differences between simultaneous and sequential groups with regards to surgical success rates, complications, or reoperations (all p > 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: In the first comparative study of simultaneous versus sequential ptosis and strabismus surgery, no advantage for sequential surgery was seen. Despite a theoretical risk of postoperative eyelid malposition or complications when surgeries were performed in a combined manner, the rate of such outcomes was not increased with simultaneous surgeries. Performing ptosis and strabismus surgery together appears to be clinically effective and safe, and reduces anesthesia exposure during childhood.",Simultaneous Versus Sequential Ptosis and Strabismus Surgery in Children.
"Objective To quantify the accuracy and reproducibility of pathologists' diagnoses of melanocytic skin lesions.Design Observer accuracy and reproducibility study.Setting 10 US states.Participants Skin biopsy cases (n=240), grouped into sets of 36 or 48. Pathologists from 10 US states were randomized to independently interpret the same set on two occasions (phases 1 and 2), at least eight months apart.Main outcome measures Pathologists' interpretations were condensed into five classes: I (eg, nevus or mild atypia); II (eg, moderate atypia); III (eg, severe atypia or melanoma in situ); IV (eg, pathologic stage T1a (pT1a) early invasive melanoma); and V (eg, >/=pT1b invasive melanoma). Reproducibility was assessed by intraobserver and interobserver concordance rates, and accuracy by concordance with three reference diagnoses.Results In phase 1, 187 pathologists completed 8976 independent case interpretations resulting in an average of 10 (SD 4) different diagnostic terms applied to each case. Among pathologists interpreting the same cases in both phases, when pathologists diagnosed a case as class I or class V during phase 1, they gave the same diagnosis in phase 2 for the majority of cases (class I 76.7%; class V 82.6%). However, the intraobserver reproducibility was lower for cases interpreted as class II (35.2%), class III (59.5%), and class IV (63.2%). Average interobserver concordance rates were lower, but with similar trends. Accuracy using a consensus diagnosis of experienced pathologists as reference varied by class: I, 92% (95% confidence interval 90% to 94%); II, 25% (22% to 28%); III, 40% (37% to 44%); IV, 43% (39% to 46%); and V, 72% (69% to 75%). It is estimated that at a population level, 82.8% (81.0% to 84.5%) of melanocytic skin biopsy diagnoses would have their diagnosis verified if reviewed by a consensus reference panel of experienced pathologists, with 8.0% (6.2% to 9.9%) of cases overinterpreted by the initial pathologist and 9.2% (8.8% to 9.6%) underinterpreted.Conclusion Diagnoses spanning moderately dysplastic nevi to early stage invasive melanoma were neither reproducible nor accurate in this large study of pathologists in the USA. Efforts to improve clinical practice should include using a standardized classification system, acknowledging uncertainty in pathology reports, and developing tools such as molecular markers to support pathologists' visual assessments.",Pathologists' diagnosis of invasive melanoma and melanocytic proliferations: observer accuracy and reproducibility study.
"OBJECTIVES: The 2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric guidelines recommend stress dose hydrocortisone in children experiencing catecholamine-dependent septic shock with suspected or proven absolute adrenal insufficiency. We evaluated whether stress dose hydrocortisone therapy in children with catecholamine dependent septic shock correlated with random serum total cortisol levels and was associated with improved outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Non-cardiac PICU. PATIENTS: Critically ill children (1 mo to 18 yr) admitted between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, with catecholamine dependent septic shock who had random serum total cortisol levels measured prior to potential stress dose hydrocortisone therapy. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cohort was dichotomized to random serum total cortisol less than 18 mcg/dL and greater than or equal to 18 mcg/dL. Associations of stress dose hydrocortisone with outcomes: PICU mortality, PICU and hospital length of stay, ventilator-free days, and vasopressor-free days were examined. Seventy children with catecholamine-dependent septic shock and measured random serum total cortisol levels were eligible (16% PICU mortality). Although 43% (30/70) had random serum total cortisol less than 18 mug/dL, 60% (42/70) received stress dose hydrocortisone. Children with random serum total cortisol less than 18 mug/dL had lower severity of illness and lower Vasopressor Inotrope Scores than those with random serum total cortisol greater than or equal to 18 mug/dL (all p < 0.05). Children with stress dose hydrocortisone had higher severity of illness and PICU mortality than those without stress dose hydrocortisone (all p < 0.05). Mean random serum total cortisol levels were similar in children with and without stress dose hydrocortisone (21.1 vs 18.7 mug/dL; p = 0.69). In children with random serum total cortisol less than 18 mug/dL, stress dose hydrocortisone was associated with greater PICU and hospital length of stay and fewer ventilator-free days (all p < 0.05). In children with random serum total cortisol greater than 18 mug/dL, stress dose hydrocortisone was associated with greater PICU mortality and fewer ventilator-free days and vasopressor-free days (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Stress dose hydrocortisone therapy in children with catecholamine-dependent septic shock correlated more with severity of illness than random serum total cortisol levels and was associated with worse outcomes, irrespective of random serum total cortisol levels.",Hydrocortisone Therapy in Catecholamine-Resistant Pediatric Septic Shock: A Pragmatic Analysis of Clinician Practice and Association With Outcomes.
Noncompliance in obtaining daily weights leads to delays in establishing treatment and discharge plans in pediatric populations. An inpatient gastrointestinal and endocrine nursing unit aimed to increase compliance of obtaining daily weights from baseline of 38% to 80%. The time daily weights were obtained was changed from 8 AM to an interval of time 4 PM to 6 PM. The compliance rate increased to 96% and has been sustained at an average of 94% over 24 months. This report describes a low-risk intervention that took minimal effort to implement but yielded high results to exceed the goal.,Improving Compliance in Obtaining Daily Weights in a Large Academic Children's Hospital.
"Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a leading cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Rapid identification of organisms from BSIs is critical for initiating targeted antimicrobial therapy. Although many methods exist for rapid identification, they do not provide detailed or definitive susceptibility information. We assessed the utility of both the VITEK MS and Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers to identify organisms from a positive blood culture bottle after only 4 h of growth on solid media compared to identification from overnight growth using the VITEK MS. Additionally, we determined whether this limited growth could yield accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results compared to overnight growth using the VITEK 2 AST system. Overall, identifications using the VITEK MS and Biotyper had agreements of 127/150 (84%) and 133/150 (88%), respectively. For rapid AST, the overall categorical agreement was 1010/1017 (99.3%), where Gram-negative bacteria had concordant results for 743/750 (99.1%) organism-drug combinations and Gram-positive bacteria had concordant results for 265/267 (99.3%). Gram-negative bacteria had 4, 2, and 1 minor, major, and very major discrepancies, respectively, while Gram-positive bacteria had no minor errors, one major, and one very major discrepancy. In conclusion, organisms grown for only 4 h on solid media were accurately identified by MALDI-TOF MS and have concordant phenotypic AST profiles. This method can also be implemented using common commercial instruments, providing a way to improve upon identification and gain detailed susceptibility information without significant additional laboratory costs.",Performance of microbial identification by MALDI-TOF MS and susceptibility testing by VITEK 2 from positive blood cultures after minimal incubation on solid media.

"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After reading this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the craniofacial dysmorphology associated with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. 2. Understand the functional concerns and preoperative considerations when treating patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. 3. Understand the various treatment options available to address patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. 4. Recognize the current debate with regard to timing and type of surgical intervention, and their impact on patient outcome, for patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. SUMMARY: Craniosynostosis is a pathologic condition associated with the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures. When the cranial sutures fuse prematurely, the skull and the growing brain beneath the suture are restricted, leading to a compensatory expansion into regions of the skull that are not affected. Craniosynostosis can occur in isolation (nonsyndromic) or can be associated with other extracranial anomalies. When anomalies outside the skull are present, craniosynostosis is often part of a syndrome and usually involves multiple sutures (syndromic craniosynostosis). This article focuses on nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, and describes the current state of knowledge regarding its diagnosis, surgical management, and outcomes.",Evidence-Based Medicine: Nonsyndromic Craniosynostosis.
"OBJECTIVES: To describe promoters and barriers to implementation of an airway safety quality improvement bundle from the perspective of interdisciplinary frontline clinicians and ICU quality improvement leaders. DESIGN: Mixed methods. SETTING: Thirteen PICUs of the National Emergency Airway Registry for Children network. INTERVENTION: Remote or on-site focus groups with interdisciplinary ICU staff. Two semistructured interviews with ICU quality improvement leaders with quantitative and qualitative data-based feedbacks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bundle implementation success (compliance) was defined as greater than or equal to 80% use for tracheal intubations for 3 consecutive months. ICUs were classified as early or late adopters. Focus group discussions concentrated on safety concerns and promoters and barriers to bundle implementation. Initial semistructured quality improvement leader interviews assessed implementation tactics and provided recommendations. Follow-up interviews assessed degree of acceptance and changes made after initial interview. Transcripts were thematically analyzed and contrasted by early versus late adopters. Median duration to achieve success was 502 days (interquartile range, 182-781). Five sites were early (median, 153 d; interquartile range, 146-267) and eight sites were late adopters (median, 783 d; interquartile range, 773-845). Focus groups identified common ""promoter"" themes-interdisciplinary approach, influential champions, and quality improvement bundle customization-and ""barrier"" themes-time constraints, competing paperwork and quality improvement activities, and poor engagement. Semistructured interviews with quality improvement leaders identified effective and ineffective tactics implemented by early and late adopters. Effective tactics included interdisciplinary quality improvement team involvement (early adopter: 5/5, 100% vs late adopter: 3/8, 38%; p = 0.08); ineffective tactics included physician-only rollouts, lack of interdisciplinary education, lack of data feedback to frontline clinicians, and misconception of bundle as research instead of quality improvement intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an airway safety quality improvement bundle with high compliance takes a long time across diverse ICUs. Both early and late adopters identified similar promoter and barrier themes. Early adopter sites customized the quality improvement bundle and had an interdisciplinary quality improvement team approach.",Promoters and Barriers to Implementation of Tracheal Intubation Airway Safety Bundle: A Mixed-Method Analysis.

"Anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) occurs when both coronary arteries arise from the same aortic sinus from a single ostium or two separate ostia. While most coronary anomalies are benign, the two most common subtypes that predispose to sudden cardiac death in the young are interarterial anomalous right coronary artery and interarterial anomalous left coronary artery. Practitioners face many challenges with AAOCA. Diagnosing patients may be difficult because children and adolescents are often asymptomatic and first presentation may be sudden death or sudden cardiac arrest. Risk stratification is also challenging as determining which unique characteristics place the child at highest risk of sudden death has not been adequately delineated and ischemic testing may give false negative results. Last, there is significant variability in decision making regarding management of youth with AAOCA. Future research is needed to help determine the best way to identify at-risk children and which treatment is the safest and most efficacious.",Introduction to anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery.
"A 7-month-old boy with malignant rhabdoid tumor of the right lateral neck, status post resection and chemotherapy, underwent FDG PET/CT for restaging. The images showed diffuse increased activity in the spleen and in the bone marrow of the appendicular bones and the spine, which is related to hematopoietin administered after chemotherapy. The images also revealed intense activity in the region of sphenoid bone, which is not a common region to have elevated FDG activity. The subsequent MRI scan showed that this activity was due to not-yet-converted red marrow in the sphenoid bone in this pediatric patient.",Elevated FDG Activity in the Nonpneumatized Sphenoid Bone in an Infant.
"BACKGROUND: The success rates and related complications of various techniques for intubation in children with difficult airways remain unknown. The primary aim of this study is to compare the success rates of fiber-optic intubation via supraglottic airway to videolaryngoscopy in children with difficult airways. Our secondary aim is to compare the complication rates of these techniques. METHODS: Observational data were collected from 14 sites after management of difficult pediatric airways. Patient age, intubation technique, success per attempt, use of continuous ventilation, and complications were recorded for each case. First-attempt success and complications were compared in subjects managed with fiber-optic intubation via supraglottic airway and videolaryngoscopy. RESULTS: Fiber-optic intubation via supraglottic airway and videolaryngoscopy had similar first-attempt success rates (67 of 114, 59% vs. 404 of 786, 51%; odds ratio 1.35; 95% CI, 0.91 to 2.00; P = 0.16). In subjects less than 1 yr old, fiber-optic intubation via supraglottic airway was more successful on the first attempt than videolaryngoscopy (19 of 35, 54% vs. 79 of 220, 36%; odds ratio, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.04 to 4.31; P = 0.042). Complication rates were similar in the two groups (20 vs. 13%; P = 0.096). The incidence of hypoxemia was lower when continuous ventilation through the supraglottic airway was used throughout the fiber-optic intubation attempt. CONCLUSIONS: In this nonrandomized study, first-attempt success rates were similar for fiber-optic intubation via supraglottic airway and videolaryngoscopy. Fiber-optic intubation via supraglottic airway is associated with higher first-attempt success than videolaryngoscopy in infants with difficult airways. Continuous ventilation through the supraglottic airway during fiber-optic intubation attempts may lower the incidence of hypoxemia.",Videolaryngoscopy versus Fiber-optic Intubation through a Supraglottic Airway in Children with a Difficult Airway: An Analysis from the Multicenter Pediatric Difficult Intubation Registry.
"This paper is the fourth in a 5-part series that focuses on educating and training the clinical and translational science workforce. The goal of this paper is to delineate components of effective career development programs that go beyond didactic training. All academic health centers with a Clinical and Translational Science Award have a KL2 career development award for junior faculty, and many also have a TL1 training program for predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows. The training across these programs varies, however junior investigators across the United States experience similar challenges. Junior investigators can get overwhelmed with the demands of building their own research program, particularly in academia. 1Often, they are sidetracked by competing demands that can derail their progress. In these situations, junior investigators experience frustration and may search for alternative career paths. By providing them with additional professional skills in the 5 domains of: (1) self-awareness; (2) selecting the right topic and securing funding; (3) getting adequate support; (4) working with others; and (5) managing yourself, your career, and your demands. We will give junior investigators additional tools to manage these demands and facilitate their own career success.",Creating effective career development programs.
"Growth is the single most important indication of the health of a child. Identification of growth disorders in all children is crucial as growth failure can be the first sign of a number of acute and chronic conditions. However, gender and racial biases have resulted in inequities in the identification, referral and treatment of children with growth disorders. In addition, short children have been impacted by a number of psychosocial issues. Heightism is prejudice or discrimination against individuals based on height, and refers to discrimination against individuals whose height is not within the normal acceptable range. Studies have shown that short children have been affected by juvenilization, teasing, bullying, victimization, loss of independence/ overprotection, and exclusion. The role of the advanced practice nurse is critical in addressing heightism and racial and gender disparities in children with growth failure/short stature.","Children with Short Stature and Growth Failure: Heightism, Gender and Racial Disparities."
"Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is rapidly becoming a standard of care in the management of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Today's devices are nearly as accurate as home glucose meters. They provide glucose data every 5 minutes, alert to high and low blood glucose levels, and allow for remote monitoring of a user's glucose data and patterns. Use of CGM has many benefits including support for tighter glycemic control without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia. There is however emerging evidence of some negative aspects associated with using CGM, which may result in decreased utilization of the device as well as a decline in quality of life, especially in the pediatric population.

"Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, and its prevalence has been projected to grow by 40% in the next decade. This increasing prevalence has implications for the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and also for chronic kidney disease (CKD). A high body mass index is one of the strongest risk factors for new-onset CKD. In individuals affected by obesity, a compensatory hyperfiltration occurs to meet the heightened metabolic demands of the increased body weight. The increase in intraglomerular pressure can damage the kidneys and raise the risk of developing CKD in the long term. The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy has increased 10-fold in recent years. Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis, and for a number of malignancies including kidney cancer. This year World Kidney Day promotes education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyles and health policy measures that make preventive behaviors an affordable option.",Obesity and kidney disease: hidden consequences of the epidemic.

"BACKGROUND: Negative symptoms significantly contribute to disability and lack of community participation for low functioning individuals with schizophrenia. Cognitive therapy has been shown to improve negative symptoms and functional outcome in this population. Elucidation of the mechanisms of the therapy would lead to a better understanding of negative symptoms and the development of more effective interventions to promote recovery. The objective of this study was to determine (1) whether guided success at a card-sorting task will produce improvement in defeatist beliefs, positive beliefs about the self, mood, and card-sorting performance, and (2) whether these changes in beliefs and mood predict improvements in unguided card-sorting. METHODS: Individuals with schizophrenia having prominent negative symptoms and impaired neurocognitive performance (N = 35) were randomized to guided success (n = 19) or a control (n = 16) condition. RESULTS: Controlling for baseline performance, the experimental group performed significantly better, endorsed defeatist beliefs to a lesser degree, reported greater positive self-concept, and reported better mood than the control condition immediately after the experimental session. A composite index of change in defeatist beliefs, self-concept, and mood was significantly correlated with improvements in card-sorting. CONCLUSIONS: This analogue study supports the rationale of cognitive therapy and provides a general therapeutic model in which experiential interventions that produce success have a significant immediate effect on a behavioral task, mediated by changes in beliefs and mood. The rapid improvement is a promising indicator of the responsiveness of this population, often regarded as recalcitrant, to cognitively-targeted behavioral interventions.","Rapid improvement in beliefs, mood, and performance following an experimental success experience in an analogue test of recovery-oriented cognitive therapy."

"INTRODUCTION: To avoid potential cardiovascular collapse after resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA), current guidelines recommend methodically deflating the balloon for 5 minutes to gradually reperfuse distal tissue beds. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that this approach may still result in unpredictable aortic flow rates and hemodynamic instability. We sought to characterize aortic flow dynamics following REBOA as the balloon is deflated in accordance with current practice guidelines. METHODS: Eight Yorkshire-cross swine were splenectomized, instrumented, and subjected to rapid 25% total blood volume hemorrhage. After 30 minutes of shock, animals received 60 minutes of Zone 1 REBOA with a low-profile REBOA catheter. During subsequent resuscitation with shed blood, the aortic occlusion balloon was gradually deflated in stepwise fashion at the rate of 0.5 mL every 30 seconds until completely deflated. Aortic flow rate and proximal mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured continuously over the period of balloon deflation. RESULTS: Graded balloon deflation resulted in variable initial return of aortic flow (median, 78 seconds; interquartile range [IQR], 68-105 seconds). A rapid increase in aortic flow during a single-balloon deflation step was observed in all animals (median, 819 mL/min; IQR, 664-1241 mL/min) and corresponded with an immediate decrease in proximal MAP (median, 30 mm Hg; IQR, 14.5-37 mm Hg). Total balloon volume and time to return of flow demonstrated no correlation (r = 0.016). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to characterize aortic flow during balloon deflation following REBOA. A steep inflection point occurs during balloon deflation that results in an abrupt increase in aortic flow and a concomitant decrease in MAP. Furthermore, the onset of distal aortic flow was inconsistent across study animals and did not correlate with initial balloon volume or relative deflation volume. Future studies to define the factors that affect aortic flow during balloon deflation are needed to facilitate controlled reperfusion following REBOA.",Incremental balloon deflation following complete resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta results in steep inflection of flow and rapid reperfusion in a large animal model of hemorrhagic shock.
"The aim of this study was to describe serial changes in echocardiographic Doppler pulmonary vein flow (PVF) patterns in infants with single right ventricle (RV) anomalies enrolled in the Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial. Measurement of PVF peak systolic (S) and diastolic (D) velocities, velocity time integrals (VTI), S/D peak velocity and VTI ratios, and frequency of atrial reversal (Ar) waves were made at three postoperative time points in 261 infants: early post-Norwood, pre-stage II surgery, and 14 months. Indices were compared over time, between initial shunt type [modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) and right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS)] and in relation to clinical outcomes. S velocities and VTI increased over time while D wave was stable, resulting in increasing S/D peak velocity and VTI ratios, with a median post-Norwood S/D VTI ratio of 1.14 versus 1.38 at pre-stage II and 1.89 at 14 months (P < 0.0001 between intervals). MBTS subjects had significantly higher S/D peak velocity and VTI ratios compared to RVPAS at the post-Norwood and pre-stage II time points (P < 0.0001) but not by 14 months. PVF patterns did not correlate with survival or hospitalization course at 1 year. PVF patterns after Norwood palliation differ from normal infants by having a dominant systolic pattern throughout infancy. PVF differences based upon shunt type resolve by 14 months and did not correlate with clinical outcomes. This study describes normative values and variations in PVF for infants with a single RV from shunt-dependent pulmonary blood flow to cavopulmonary blood flow.",Pulmonary Vein Doppler Patterns in Infants with Single Right Ventricle Anomalies After Initial Staged Palliations.
"Obscurins are cytoskeletal proteins with structural and regulatory roles encoded by OBSCN. Mutations in OBSCN are associated with the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Specifically, the R4344Q mutation present in immunoglobulin domain 58 (Ig58) was the first to be linked with the development of HCM. To assess the effects of R4344Q in vivo, we generated the respective knock-in mouse model. Mutant obscurins are expressed and incorporated normally into sarcomeres. The expression patterns of sarcomeric and Ca(2+)-cycling proteins are unaltered in sedentary 1-year-old knock-in myocardia, with the exception of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) adenosine triphosphatase 2 (SERCA2) and pentameric phospholamban whose levels are significantly increased and decreased, respectively. Isolated cardiomyocytes from 1-year-old knock-in hearts exhibit increased Ca(2+)-transients and Ca(2+)-load in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and faster contractility kinetics. Moreover, sedentary 1-year-old knock-in animals develop tachycardia accompanied by premature ventricular contractions, whereas 2-month-old knock-in animals subjected to pressure overload develop a DCM-like phenotype. Structural analysis revealed that the R4344Q mutation alters the distribution of electrostatic charges over the Ig58 surface, thus interfering with its binding capabilities. Consistent with this, wild-type Ig58 interacts with phospholamban modestly, and this interaction is markedly enhanced in the presence of R4344Q. Together, our studies demonstrate that under sedentary conditions, the R4344Q mutation results in Ca(2+) deregulation and spontaneous arrhythmia, whereas in the presence of chronic, pathological stress, it leads to cardiac remodeling and dilation. We postulate that enhanced binding between mutant obscurins and phospholamban leads to SERCA2 disinhibition, which may underlie the observed pathological alterations.",Deregulated Ca(2+) cycling underlies the development of arrhythmia and heart disease due to mutant obscurin.
"Introduction: Successful population-level antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence will be necessary to realize both the clinical and prevention benefits of antiretroviral scale-up and, ultimately, the end of AIDS. Although many people living with HIV are adhering well, others struggle and most are likely to experience challenges in adherence that may threaten virologic suppression at some point during lifelong therapy. Despite the importance of ART adherence, supportive interventions have generally not been implemented at scale. The objective of this review is to summarize the recommendations of clinical, research, and public health experts for scalable ART adherence interventions in resource-limited settings. Methods: In July 2015, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation convened a meeting to discuss the most promising ART adherence interventions for use at scale in resource-limited settings. This article summarizes that discussion with recent updates. It is not a systematic review, but rather provides practical considerations for programme implementation based on evidence from individual studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and the World Health Organization Consolidated Guidelines for HIV, which include evidence from randomized controlled trials in low- and middle-income countries. Interventions are categorized broadly as education and counselling; information and communication technology-enhanced solutions; healthcare delivery restructuring; and economic incentives and social protection interventions. Each category is discussed, including descriptions of interventions, current evidence for effectiveness, and what appears promising for the near future. Approaches to intervention implementation and impact assessment are then described. Results and discussion: The evidence base is promising for currently available, effective, and scalable ART adherence interventions for resource-limited settings. Numerous interventions build on existing health care infrastructure and leverage available resources. Those most widely studied and implemented to date involve peer counselling, adherence clubs, and short message service (SMS). Many additional interventions could have an important impact on ART adherence with further development, including standardized counselling through multi-media technology, electronic dose monitoring, decentralized and differentiated models of care, and livelihood interventions. Optimal targeting and tailoring of interventions will require improved adherence measurement. Conclusions: The opportunity exists today to address and resolve many of the challenges to effective ART adherence, so that they do not limit the potential of ART to help bring about the end of AIDS.",Improving antiretroviral therapy adherence in resource-limited settings at scale: a discussion of interventions and recommendations.
"Advances in understanding diabetes mellitus (DM) through basic and clinical research have helped clarify and reunify a disease state fragmented into numerous etiologies and subtypes. It is now understood that a common pathophysiology drives the diabetic state throughout its natural history and across its varied clinical presentations, a pathophysiology involving metabolic insults, oxidative damage, and vicious cycles that aggravate and intensify organ dysfunction and damage. This new understanding of the disease requires that we revisit existing diagnostics and treatment approaches, which were built upon outmoded assumptions. 'The Common Pathophysiologic Origins of Diabetes Mellitus and its Complications Construct' is presented as a more accurate, foundational, and translatable construct of DM that helps make sense of the hitherto ambiguous findings of long-term outcome studies.",A Unified Pathophysiological Construct of Diabetes and its Complications.
"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-stranded RNAs that are joined head to tail with largely unknown functions. Here we show that transfection of purified in vitro generated circRNA into mammalian cells led to potent induction of innate immunity genes and confers protection against viral infection. The nucleic acid sensor RIG-I is necessary to sense foreign circRNA, and RIG-I and foreign circRNA co-aggregate in cytoplasmic foci. CircRNA activation of innate immunity is independent of a 5' triphosphate, double-stranded RNA structure, or the primary sequence of the foreign circRNA. Instead, self-nonself discrimination depends on the intron that programs the circRNA. Use of a human intron to express a foreign circRNA sequence abrogates immune activation, and mature human circRNA is associated with diverse RNA binding proteins reflecting its endogenous splicing and biogenesis. These results reveal innate immune sensing of circRNA and highlight introns-the predominant output of mammalian transcription-as arbiters of self-nonself identity.",Sensing Self and Foreign Circular RNAs by Intron Identity.
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant astrocytoma characterized by extensive invasion, angiogenesis, hypoxia, and micrometastasis. Despite the relatively leaky nature of GBM blood vessels, effective delivery of antitumor therapeutics has been a major challenge due to the complications caused by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the highly torturous nature of newly formed tumor vasculature (blood tumor barrier-BTB). External beam radiotherapy was previously shown to be an effective means of permeabilizing central nervous system (CNS) barriers. By using targeted short-ranged radionuclides, we show for the first time that our targeted actinium-225-labeled alphavbeta3-specific liposomes ((225)Ac-IA-TLs) caused catastrophic double stranded DNA breaks and significantly enhanced the permeability of BBB and BTB in mice bearing orthotopic GBMs. Histologic studies revealed characteristic alpha-particle induced double strand breaks within tumors but was not significantly present in normal brain regions away from the tumor where BBB permeability was observed. These findings indicate that the enhanced vascular permeability in these distal regions did not result from direct alpha-particle-induced DNA damage. On the basis of these results, in addition to their direct antitumor effects, (225)Ac-IA-TLs can potentially be used to enhance the permeability of BBB and BTB for effective delivery of systemically administered antitumor therapeutics.

"Prominent accounts of decision making state that decisions are made on the basis of an accumulation of sensory evidence, orchestrated by networks of prefrontal and parietal neural populations. Here we assess whether these findings generalize to decisions on self-motion. Participants were presented with whole body yaw rotations of different durations in a 2-Interval-Forced-Choice paradigm, and tasked to discriminate motions on the basis of their amplitude. The cortical hemodynamic response was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while participants were performing the task. The imaging data was used to predict the specific response on individual experimental trials, and to predict whether the comparison stimulus would be judged larger than the reference. Classifier performance on the former variable was negligible. However, considerable performance was achieved for the latter variable, specifically using parietal imaging data. The findings provide support for the notion that activity in the parietal cortex reflects modality independent decision variables that represent the strength of the neural evidence in favor of a decision. The results are encouraging for the use of fNIRS as a method to perform neuroimaging in moving individuals.",Neural correlates of decision making on whole body yaw rotation: An fNIRS study.
"BACKGROUND: Palivizumab is the standard immunoprophylaxis against serious disease due to respiratory syncytial virus infection. Current evidence-based prophylaxis guidelines may not address certain children with CHD within specific high-risk groups or clinical/management settings. METHODS: An international steering committee of clinicians with expertise in paediatric heart disease identified key questions concerning palivizumab administration; in collaboration with an additional international expert faculty, evidence-based recommendations were formulated using a quasi-Delphi consensus methodology. RESULTS: Palivizumab prophylaxis was recommended for children with the following conditions: <2 years with unoperated haemodynamically significant CHD, who are cyanotic, who have pulmonary hypertension, or symptomatic airway abnormalities; <1 year with cardiomyopathies requiring treatment; in the 1st year of life with surgically operated CHD with haemodynamically significant residual problems or aged 1-2 years up to 6 months postoperatively; and on heart transplant waiting lists or in their 1st year after heart transplant. Unanimous consensus was not reached for use of immunoprophylaxis in children with asymptomatic CHD and other co-morbid factors such as arrhythmias, Down syndrome, or immunodeficiency, or during a nosocomial outbreak. Challenges to effective immunoprophylaxis included the following: multidisciplinary variations in identifying candidates with CHD and prophylaxis compliance; limited awareness of severe disease risks/burden; and limited knowledge of respiratory syncytial virus seasonal patterns in subtropical/tropical regions. CONCLUSION: Evidence-based immunoprophylaxis recommendations were formulated for subgroups of children with CHD, but more data are needed to guide use in tropical/subtropical countries and in children with certain co-morbidities.",CHD and respiratory syncytial virus: global expert exchange recommendations.
"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) aids in clinical assessment of patients with Fontan circulation. Effects of persistent fenestration on CPET variables have not been clearly defined. Associations between fenestration and CPET variables at anaerobic threshold (AT) and peak exercise were explored in the Pediatric Heart Network Fontan Cross-Sectional Study cohort. Fenestration patency was associated with a greater decrease in oxygen saturation from rest to peak exercise (fenestration -4.9 +/- 3.8 v. nonfenestration -3 +/- 3.5; P < .001). Physiological dead space at peak exercise was higher in fenestrated v. nonfenestrated (25.2 +/- 16.1 v. 21.4 +/- 15.2; P = .03). There was a weak association between fenestration patency and maximal work and heart rate. Fenestration patency was also weakly correlated with oxygen pulse, work and VE/VCO2 at AT. The effect of persistent fenestration on CPET measurements was minimal in this study, likely due to the cross-sectional design.",Effects of persistent Fontan fenestration patency on cardiopulmonary exercise testing variables.
"OBJECTIVE: Examine how pediatric and obstetrical subspecialists view benefits and burdens of prenatal myelomeningocele (MMC) closure. STUDY DESIGN: Mail survey of 1200 neonatologists, pediatric surgeons and maternal-fetal medicine specialists (MFMs). RESULTS: Of 1176 eligible physicians, 670 (57%) responded. Most respondents disagreed (68%, 11% strongly) that open fetal surgery places an unacceptable burden on women and their families. Most agreed (65%, 10% strongly) that denying the benefits of open maternal-fetal surgery is unfair to the future child. Most (94%) would recommend prenatal fetoscopic over open or postnatal MMC closure for a hypothetical fetoscopic technique that had similar shunt rates (40%) but decreased maternal morbidity. When the hypothetical shunt rate for fetoscopy was increased to 60%, physicians were split (49% fetoscopy versus 45% open). Views about burdens and fairness correlated with the likelihood of recommending postnatal or fetoscopic over open closure. CONCLUSION: Individual and specialty-specific values may influence recommendations about prenatal surgery.",Physician views regarding the benefits and burdens of prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele.
"Our objective is to investigate which factors and patient characteristics are associated with success in Trabectome surgery.A total of 658 phakic cases with at least of 12 months follow-up were included in the analysis. Baseline demographics and medical data were collected. The main outcome measure was intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma medication (Rx), and secondary glaucoma surgery if any. Success was defined as IOP reduction of 20% or more from preoperative IOP and IOP < 21 mm Hg with no secondary surgery throughout the follow-up period. Risk factors for failure were determined by using univariate and multivariate cox regression.At baseline, the average IOP was 23.6 +/- 7.8 mm Hg and the average number of medications was 2.6 +/- 1.3 for all cases. At 12 months, the average IOP was 16.0 +/- 3.6 mm Hg (P < .01) and the average number of medications was 1.8 +/- 1.3 (P < .01). Based on the result of multivariate cox regression model, we found that the Trabectome + Phaco (TP) and Trabectome alone (TA) group had a 94% and 79% survival rate at 12 months, respectively. TP cases had 78% lower risk of failure than TA (95% confidence interval [CI]: 54-89), diagnosis of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma had a 54% lower risk of failure than primary open angle glaucoma patients (95% CI: 1-78). Hispanics had an estimated hazard ratio that is 60% lower than Caucasians (95% CI: 18-80); 20% of TA cases and 3% of TP cases were required to undergo additional secondary surgery (P < .01).Trabectome surgery, whether in combination with phacoemulsification cataract removal or stand alone, is associated with a significant reduction of IOP and glaucoma medication. Patients having a higher baseline IOP are expected to have a higher IOP reduction after Trabectome. Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, combination with phacoemulsification cataract surgery and Hispanic race are factors associated with enhanced Trabectome survival.",Trabectome success factors.
"BACKGROUND: In human cortical neural progenitor cells, we investigated the effects of propofol on calcium homeostasis in both the ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate calcium release channels. We also studied propofol-mediated effects on autophagy, cell survival, and neuro- and gliogenesis. METHODS: The dose-response relationship between propofol concentration and duration was studied in neural progenitor cells. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. The effects of propofol on cytosolic calcium concentration were evaluated using Fura-2, and autophagy activity was determined by LC3II expression levels with Western blot. Proliferation and differentiation were evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and immunostaining with neuronal and glial markers. RESULTS: Propofol dose- and time-dependently induced cell damage and elevated LC3II expression, most robustly at 200 microM for 24 h (67 +/- 11% of control, n = 12 to 19) and 6 h (2.4 +/- 0.5 compared with 0.6 +/- 0.1 of control, n = 7), respectively. Treatment with 200 muM propofol also increased cytosolic calcium concentration (346 +/- 71% of control, n = 22 to 34). Propofol at 10 microM stimulated neural progenitor cell proliferation and promoted neuronal cell fate, whereas propofol at 200 microM impaired neuronal proliferation and promoted glial cell fate (n = 12 to 20). Cotreatment with ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonists and inhibitors, cytosolic Ca chelators, or autophagy inhibitors mostly mitigated the propofol-mediated effects on survival, proliferation, and differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that propofol-mediated cell survival or neurogenesis is closely associated with propofol's effects on autophagy by activation of ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.",Propofol Affects Neurodegeneration and Neurogenesis by Regulation of Autophagy via Effects on Intracellular Calcium Homeostasis.
"INTRODUCTION: Peer review, a cornerstone of academia, promotes rigor and relevance in scientific publishing. As educators are encouraged to adopt a more scholarly approach to medical education, peer review is becoming increasingly important. Junior educators both receive the reviews of their peers, and are also asked to participate as reviewers themselves. As such, it is imperative for junior clinician educators to be well-versed in the art of peer reviewing their colleagues' work. In this article, our goal was to identify and summarize key papers that may be helpful for faculty members interested in learning more about the peer-review process and how to improve their reviewing skills. METHODS: The online discussions of the 2016-17 Academic Life in Emergency Medicine (ALiEM) Faculty Incubator program included a robust discussion about peer review, which highlighted a number of papers on that topic. We sought to augment this list with further suggestions by guest experts and by an open call on Twitter for other important papers. Via this process, we created a list of 24 total papers on the topic of peer review. After gathering these papers, our authorship group engaged in a consensus-building process incorporating Delphi methods to identify the papers that best described peer review, and also highlighted important tips for new reviewers. RESULTS: We found and reviewed 24 papers. In our results section, we present our authorship group's top five most highly rated papers on the topic of peer review. We also summarize these papers with respect to their relevance to junior faculty members and to faculty developers. CONCLUSION: We present five key papers on peer review that can be used for faculty development for novice writers and reviewers. These papers represent a mix of foundational and explanatory papers that may provide some basis from which junior faculty members might build upon as they both undergo the peer-review process and act as reviewers in turn.",Academic Primer Series: Key Papers About Peer Review.
"Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes approximately 625,000 deaths per year from nervous system infections. Here, we leveraged a unique, genetically diverse population of C. neoformans from sub-Saharan Africa, commonly isolated from mopane trees, to determine how selective pressures in the environment coincidentally adapted C. neoformans for human virulence. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 387 isolates, representing the global VNI and African VNB lineages, highlighted a deep, nonrecombining split in VNB (herein, VNBI and VNBII). VNBII was enriched for clinical samples relative to VNBI, while phenotypic profiling of 183 isolates demonstrated that VNBI isolates were significantly more resistant to oxidative stress and more heavily melanized than VNBII isolates. Lack of melanization in both lineages was associated with loss-of-function mutations in the BZP4 transcription factor. A genome-wide association study across all VNB isolates revealed sequence differences between clinical and environmental isolates in virulence factors and stress response genes. Inositol transporters and catabolism genes, which process sugars present in plants and the human nervous system, were identified as targets of selection in all three lineages. Further phylogenetic and population genomic analyses revealed extensive loss of genetic diversity in VNBI, suggestive of a history of population bottlenecks, along with unique evolutionary trajectories for mating type loci. These data highlight the complex evolutionary interplay between adaptation to natural environments and opportunistic infections, and that selection on specific pathways may predispose isolates to human virulence.",Population genomics and the evolution of virulence in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans.

"Small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (SBNETs) have been increasing in frequency over the past decades, and are now the most common type of small bowel tumor. Consequently, general surgeons and surgical oncologists are seeing more patients with SBNETs in their practices than ever before. The management of these patients is often complex, owing to their secretion of hormones, frequent presentation with advanced disease, and difficulties with making the diagnosis of SBNETs. Despite these issues, even patients with advanced disease can have long-term survival. There are a number of scenarios which commonly arise in SBNET patients where it is difficult to determine the optimal management from the published data. To address these challenges for clinicians, a consensus conference was held assembling experts in the field to review and discuss the available literature and patterns of practice pertaining to specific management issues. This paper summarizes the important elements from these studies and the recommendations of the group for these questions regarding the management of SBNET patients.",The Surgical Management of Small Bowel Neuroendocrine Tumors: Consensus Guidelines of the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society.
"BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding the influence of religion on breastfeeding in African American communities. In particular, whether Islamic traditions influence breastfeeding beliefs and practices among African American Muslims has not been studied. Research aim: This study sought to gain understanding of breastfeeding attitudes, rates, and education among African American Muslims in West Philadelphia and to examine if engaging Islamic teachings in breastfeeding education can positively influence breastfeeding attitudes. METHODS: Open-ended, in-person, digitally recorded qualitative interviews were conducted with 10 community leaders and analyzed by conventional content analysis. A study tool distributed to a convenience sample of 44 community members and 11 leaders was used to gather information about education received from community leaders, breastfeeding attitudes and practices, and the potential for Islamic teachings to positively affect breastfeeding attitudes and practices. To obtain further data on this last topic, preliminary data analysis guided the creation of an education pamphlet, about which feedback was gathered through another study tool. RESULTS: Education surrounding Islamic perspectives on breastfeeding was not prevalent. African American Muslims in West Philadelphia view breastfeeding favorably and have higher rates of breastfeeding than African Americans as a whole. Community education about breastfeeding that engaged Islamic teachings improved respondents' breastfeeding attitudes. CONCLUSION: Increasing education among providers and African American Muslims about Islamic perspectives on breastfeeding may improve breastfeeding exclusivity and duration. Healthcare providers who care for Muslim women should be aware of Islam's tradition of positive attitudes toward breastfeeding and partner with Muslim leaders to improve breastfeeding rates and duration among such women.",Influence of Islamic Traditions on Breastfeeding Beliefs and Practices Among African American Muslims in West Philadelphia: A Mixed-Methods Study.
"The goal of this preliminary proof-of-concept study was to use human protein microarrays to identify blood-based autoantibody biomarkers capable of diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS). Using sera from 112 subjects, including 51 MS subjects, autoantibody biomarkers effectively differentiated MS subjects from age- and gender-matched normal and breast cancer controls with 95.0% and 100% overall accuracy, but not from subjects with Parkinson's disease. Autoantibody biomarkers were also useful in distinguishing subjects with the relapsing-remitting form of MS from those with the secondary progressive subtype. These results demonstrate that autoantibodies can be used as noninvasive blood-based biomarkers for the detection and subtyping of MS.",Autoantibodies as diagnostic biomarkers for the detection and subtyping of multiple sclerosis.
"Musculoskeletal traumatic injuries in children demonstrate characteristic imaging findings. The physis is the most susceptible structure to traumatic injury.

"Gene fusions resulting from structural rearrangements are an established mechanism of tumorigenesis in pediatric cancer. In this clinical cohort, 1,350 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based chromosomal microarrays from 1,211 pediatric cancer patients were evaluated for copy number alterations (CNAs) associated with gene fusions. Karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were performed in 42% of the patients. Ten percent of the bone marrow or solid tumor specimens had SNP array-associated CNAs suggestive of a gene fusion. Alterations involving ETV6, ABL1-NUP214, EBF1-PDGFRB, KMT2A(MLL), LMO2-RAG, MYH11-CBFB, NSD1-NUP98, PBX1, STIL-TAL1, ZNF384-TCF3, P2RY8-CRLF2, and RUNX1T1-RUNX1 fusions were detected in the bone marrow samples. The most common alteration among the low-grade gliomas was a 7q34 tandem duplication resulting in a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Additional fusions identified in the pediatric brain tumors included FAM131B-BRAF and RAF1-QKI. COL1A1-PDGFB, CRTC1-MAML2, EWSR1, HEY1, PAX3- and PAX7-FOXO1, and PLAG1 fusions were determined in a variety of solid tumors and a novel potential gene fusion, FGFR1-USP6, was detected in an aneurysmal bone cyst. The identification of these gene fusions was instrumental in tumor diagnosis. In contrast to hematologic and solid tumors in adults that are predominantly driven by mutations, the majority of hematologic and solid tumors in children are characterized by CNAs and gene fusions. Chromosomal microarray analysis is therefore a robust platform to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers in the clinical setting.",Copy number alterations determined by single nucleotide polymorphism array testing in the clinical laboratory are indicative of gene fusions in pediatric cancer patients.
"There is a need for a clear definition of exacerbations used in clinical trials in patients with bronchiectasis. An expert conference was convened to develop a consensus definition of an exacerbation for use in clinical research.A systematic review of exacerbation definitions used in clinical trials from January 2000 until December 2015 and involving adults with bronchiectasis was conducted. A Delphi process followed by a round-table meeting involving bronchiectasis experts was organised to reach a consensus definition. These experts came from Europe (representing the European Multicentre Bronchiectasis Research Collaboration), North America (representing the US Bronchiectasis Research Registry/COPD Foundation), Australasia and South Africa.The definition was unanimously approved by the working group as: a person with bronchiectasis with a deterioration in three or more of the following key symptoms for at least 48 h: cough; sputum volume and/or consistency; sputum purulence; breathlessness and/or exercise tolerance; fatigue and/or malaise; haemoptysis AND a clinician determines that a change in bronchiectasis treatment is required.The working group proposes the use of this consensus-based definition for bronchiectasis exacerbation in future clinical research involving adults with bronchiectasis.",Pulmonary exacerbation in adults with bronchiectasis: a consensus definition for clinical research.
"OBJECTIVES: Delirium is prevalent among critically ill children, yet associated outcomes and modifiable risk factors are not well defined. The objective of this study was to determine associations between pediatric delirium and modifiable risk factors such as benzodiazepine exposure and short-term outcomes. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of collected data from the prospective validation study of the Preschool Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. SETTING: Tertiary-level PICU. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients 6 months to 5 years old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Daily delirium assessments were completed using the Preschool Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. Associations between baseline and in-hospital risk factors were analyzed for likelihood of ICU discharge using Cox proportional hazards regression and delirium duration using negative binomial regression. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine associations between daily risk factors and delirium presence the following day. Our 300-patient cohort had a median (interquartile range) age of 20 months (11-37 mo), and 44% had delirium for at least 1 day (1-2 d). Delirium was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of ICU discharge in preschool-aged children (age-specific hazard ratios at 60, 36, and 12 mo old were 0.17 [95% CI, 0.05-0.61], 0.50 [0.32-0.80], and 0.98 [0.68-1.41], respectively). Greater benzodiazepine exposure (75-25th percentile) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of ICU discharge (hazard ratio, 0.65 [0.42-1.00]; p = 0.01), longer delirium duration (incidence rate ratio, 2.47 [1.36-4.49]; p = 0.005), and increased risk for delirium the following day (odds ratio, 2.83 [1.27-6.59]; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is associated with a lower likelihood of ICU discharge in preschool-aged children. Benzodiazepine exposure is associated with the development and longer duration of delirium, and lower likelihood of ICU discharge. These findings advocate for future studies targeting modifiable risk factors, such as reduction in benzodiazepine exposure, to mitigate iatrogenic harm in pediatric patients.",Delirium and Benzodiazepines Associated With Prolonged ICU Stay in Critically Ill Infants and Young Children.
"Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) undergoes a large conformational reorganization during remodeling of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. To detect structural transition of apoA-I upon HDL formation, we developed novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Splenocytes from BALB/c mice immunized with a recombinant human apoA-I, with or without conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, were fused with P3/NS1/1-Ag4-1 myeloma cells. After the HAT-selection and cloning, we established nine hybridoma clones secreting anti-apoA-I mAbs in which four mAbs recognize epitopes on the N-terminal half of apoA-I while the other five mAbs recognize the central region. ELISA and bio-layer interferometry measurements demonstrated that mAbs whose epitopes are within residues 1-43 or 44-65 obviously discriminate discoidal and spherical reconstituted HDL particles despite their great reactivities to lipid-free apoA-I and plasma HDL, suggesting the possibility of these mAbs to detect structural transition of apoA-I on HDL. Importantly, a helix-disrupting mutation of W50R into residues 44-65 restored the immunoreactivity of mAbs whose epitope being within residues 44-65 against reconstituted HDL particles, indicating that these mAbs specifically recognize the epitope region in a random coil state. These results encourage us to develop mAbs targeting epitopes in the N-terminal residues of apoA-I as useful probes for monitoring formation and remodeling of HDL particles.",Immunochemical Approach for Monitoring of Structural Transition of ApoA-I upon HDL Formation Using Novel Monoclonal Antibodies.
"The most common, and usually the only, endocrine disturbance in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) and epilepsy is central precocious puberty (CPP). The mechanism for CPP associated with HH may relate to ectopic generation and pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the HH, but this remains an unproven hypothesis. Possible regulators of GnRH release that are intrinsic to HH tissue include the following: (1) glial factors (such as transforming growth factor alpha[TGFalpha) and (2) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated excitation. Both are known to be present in surgically-resected HH tissue, but are present in patients with and without a history of CPP, suggesting the possibility that symptoms related to HH are directly associated with the region of anatomic attachment of the HH to the hypothalamus, which determines functional network connections, rather than to differences in HH tissue expression or pathophysiology. CPP associated with HH presents with isosexual development prior to the age of 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys. It is not uncommon for CPP with HH to present in children at an earlier age in comparison to other causes of CPP, including in infancy. Surgical resection of the HH can be effective for treating CPP, but is reserved for patients with intractable epilepsy, since GnRH agonists are widely available and effective treatment. Other endocrine disturbances with HH are rare, but can include growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. Diabetes insipidus is commonly encountered postoperatively, but is not observed with HH prior to surgical intervention.",Hypothalamic hamartoma with epilepsy: Review of endocrine comorbidity.
"Suicide prevention efforts are increasing to enhance capabilities and better understand risk factors and etiologies. Postvention, or how clinicians manage the postsuicide aftermath, strengthens suicide prevention, destigmatizes the tragedy, operationalizes the confusing aftermath, and promotes caregiver recovery. However, studies regarding its efficacy are minimal. The Psychopathology Committee of the Group for the Advancement for Psychiatry surveyed a convenience sample of psychiatrists to better understand postvention activities. Ninety psychiatrists completed the survey; they were predominantly men (72%) with an average of 24.6 years of experience (SD, 16.7 years). Most had contact with the patient's family within 6 months of the suicide, and most psychiatrists sought some form of support. Few psychiatrists used a suicide postvention procedure or toolkit (9%). No psychiatrists stopped clinical practice after a patient suicide, although 10% stopped accepting patients they deemed at risk of suicide. Postvention efforts, therefore, should be improved to better address survivor care.",Why We Need to Enhance Suicide Postvention: Evaluating a Survey of Psychiatrists' Behaviors after the Suicide of a Patient.
"BACKGROUND: Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is a commonly used mode of ventilation designed to increase mean airway pressure and thus oxygenation. Different strategies for clinical management have been described in the literature but are largely based on physiologic concepts, animal data, and small clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to determine how APRV is currently managed by surveying practicing respiratory therapists with experience using APRV. METHODS: A 15-item survey was developed by the authors and posted on the AARConnect online media platform in January 2016 after being declared exempt by our institution's institutional review board. Survey questions were derived from a literature review of recommended APRV settings. Responses were limited to one per institution. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 60 respondents who used APRV. Of the 4 key initial APRV settings (P high, P low, T high, and T low), there was good agreement among survey responders and published guidelines for setting initial T high (4-6 s) and initial P low (0 cm H2O). There was some disagreement regarding initial P high, with 48% of responders matching P high to conventional ventilation plateau pressures but another 31% using conventional ventilation mean airway pressure plus 2-5 cm H2O. The most disagreement was with the T low setting, with only 47% of survey responders agreeing with published guidelines about using the expiratory flow signal to set T low. There was good agreement among survey responders and published guidelines for what changes to make when gas exchange was outside of the targeted range. A substantial number of respondents accepted P high and APRV release volumes that may exceed lung-protective limits. CONCLUSIONS: There is only limited consensus among practitioners for initial APRV settings, probably reflecting the paucity of good clinical outcome data and confusion surrounding the physiology of this mode.",Clinical Management Strategies for Airway Pressure Release Ventilation: A Survey of Clinical Practice.
"Respirovirus infection can cause viral pneumonia and acute lung injury (ALI). The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family consists of proinflammatory cytokines that play essential roles in regulating immune and inflammatory responses in vivo. IL-1 signaling is associated with protection against respiratory influenza virus infection by mediation of the pulmonary anti-viral immune response and inflammation. We analyzed the infiltration lung immune leukocytes and cytokines that contribute to inflammatory lung pathology and mortality of fatal H1N1 virus-infected IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) deficient mice. Results showed that early innate immune cells and cytokine/chemokine dysregulation were observed with significantly decreased neutrophil infiltration and IL-6, TNF-alpha, G-CSF, KC, and MIP-2 cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of infected IL-1R1 (-/-) mice in comparison with that of wild type infected mice. The adaptive immune response against the H1N1 virus in IL-1R1 (-/-) mice was impaired with downregulated anti-viral Th1 cell, CD8+ cell, and antibody functions, which contributes to attenuated viral clearance. Histological analysis revealed reduced lung inflammation during early infection but severe lung pathology in late infection in IL-1R1 (-/-) mice compared with that in WT infected mice. Moreover, the infected IL-1R1 (-/-) mice showed markedly reduced neutrophil generation in bone marrow and neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed lung. Together, these results suggest that IL-1 signaling is associated with pulmonary anti-influenza immune response and inflammatory lung injury, particularly via the influence on neutrophil mobilization and inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production.",Pulmonary immune cells and inflammatory cytokine dysregulation are associated with mortality of IL-1R1 (-/-)mice infected with influenza virus (H1N1).
"Acne-focused dermatology expert groups have consistently recommended that most patients with acne be treated with a combination of topical retinoid and antimicrobial therapy. This is based on clinical data as well as evidence that these drug classes have different and complementary mechanisms of action that target multiple aspects of acne's complex pathophysiology. Recent evidence-based guidelines for acne, including those from the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), have agreed that retinoids have an essential role in this widespread disease. The AAD states ""retinoids are the core of topical therapy for acne because they are comedolytic, resolve the precursor microcomedone lesion, and are anti-inflammatory;"" further, they ""allow for maintenance of clearance."" Despite uniform recommendation for use of topical retinoids, a recent study of prescribing practices from 2012 to 2014 indicated that dermatologists prescribed retinoids just 58.8% of the time while non-dermatologists prescribed them for only 32.4% of cases. In this article, we review the reasons supporting retinoids as the mainstay of acne therapy and discuss some of the perceived barriers that may be limiting use of this important drug class. Further, we discuss how and when titrating retinoid concentrations may be utilized in clinical practice. FUNDING: Galderma International.",Why Topical Retinoids Are Mainstay of Therapy for Acne.
"Curvilinear mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) provides for multidimensional augmentation and rotation in mandibles with complex, abnormal morphology. This study aims to demonstrate cephalometric changes after curvilinear MDO.A prospectively maintained craniofacial database was queried for patients undergoing curvilinear MDO from 2009 to 2015. Demographic and operative data were collected. Cephalometric measurements were obtained from preoperative and postdistraction imaging, including sella-nasion-B point angle (SNB), mandibular plane angle (MPA), occlusal plane angle (OPA), and gonial angle (GA). Measurements were compared using a paired t test.Nine patients exhibiting microretrognathia and an anterior open-bite deformity had a mean age of 8.4 +/- 6.0 years and a mean follow-up of 23.2 +/- 25.3 months. Mean distance distracted was 32.6 +/- 7.2 mm, with augmentation in length and height, and rotatory closure of anterior open bites. Preoperative SNB versus postdistraction was 66.9 +/- 4.2 versus 78 +/- 9.1 degrees (P = 0.0029). MPA, OPA, and GA all decreased (61.0 +/- 10.7 vs. 45.7 +/- 11.1 degrees , P = 0.0066, 37.3 +/- 8.9 vs. 25.7 +/- 6.0 degrees , P = 0.0025, 140.3 +/- 16.1 vs. 127.3 +/- 13.2 degrees , P = 0.0019, MPA, OPA, and GA, respectively), trending toward normalization.

"PURPOSE: Several pathologic staging systems characterize residual tumor in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Pathologic complete response (pCR) is now accepted by the Food and Drug Administration as an endpoint for granting accelerated drug approval. Two other systems of post-neoadjuvant pathologic tumor staging-residual cancer burden (RCB) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer post-neoadjuvant therapy staging system (yAJCC)-have been developed to characterize residual tumors when patients do not achieve pCR. The optimal system and the ways in which these systems complement each other have not been fully determined. METHODS: Using data from the I-SPY 1 TRIAL, we compared pCR, RCB, and yAJCC as predictors of early recurrence-free survival (RFS) to identify ways to improve post-neoadjuvant pathologic evaluation. RESULTS: Among 162 patients assessed, pCR identified patients at lowest risk of recurrence, while RCB and yAJCC identified patients at highest risk. Hormone-receptor (HR) and HER2 subtypes further improved risk prediction. Recursive partitioning indicated that triple-negative or HER2+ patients with yAJCC III or RCB 3 have the highest recurrence risk, with an RFS of 27%. Our analysis also highlighted discrepancies between RCB and yAJCC stratification: 31% of patients had discrepant RCB and yAJCC scores. We identified differential treatment of lymph node involvement and tumor cellularity as drivers of these discrepancies. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that there is benefit to reporting both RCB and yAJCC for patients in order to identify those at highest risk of relapse.","Comparison of residual cancer burden, American Joint Committee on Cancer staging and pathologic complete response in breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: results from the I-SPY 1 TRIAL (CALGB 150007/150012; ACRIN 6657)."
"Objective: The prevalence of older adults living with HIV is rising, as is their risk for everyday functioning problems associated with neurocognitive dysfunction. Multitasking, the ability to maintain and carry out subgoals in support of a larger goal, is a multidimensional skill ubiquitous during most real-life tasks and associated with prefrontal networks that are vulnerable in HIV. Understanding factors associated with multitasking will improve characterization of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Metacognition is also associated with frontal systems, is impaired among individuals with HIV, and may contribute to multitasking. Method: Ninety-nine older (>/=50 years) adults with HIV completed: the Everyday Multitasking Test (MT), a performance-based measure during which participants concurrently attempt four everyday tasks (e.g., medication management) within a time limit; a comprehensive neuropsychological battery; measures of metacognition regarding their MT performance (e.g., metacognitive knowledge and online awareness). Results: Better global neuropsychological performance (i.e., average T-score across all domains) was associated with better Everyday MT total scores (rho = 0.34; p < .001), as was global metacognition (rho = 0.37, p < .01). Bootstrapping mediation analysis revealed global metacognition was a significant partial mediator between neurocognition and Everyday MT (b = 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01, 0.25). Specifically, metacognitive knowledge (but not online awareness) drove this mediation (b = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.27). Conclusions: Consistent with findings among younger persons with HIV, neuropsychological performance is strongly associated with a complex, laboratory-based test of everyday multitasking, and metacognition of task performance was a pathway through which successful multitasking occurred. Interventions aimed at modifying metacognition to improve daily functioning may be warranted among older adults with HIV.",Everyday Multitasking Abilities in Older HIV+ Adults: Neurobehavioral Correlates and the Mediating Role of Metacognition.
"Central oxytocin receptor (OT-R) signaling reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure, but the central sites and mechanisms mediating these effects are unresolved. We showed previously that pharmacological activation of OT-R in hindbrain/nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) amplifies the intake-inhibitory effects of gastrointestinal (GI) satiation signals. Unexplored were the energetic effects of hindbrain OT-R agonism and the physiological relevance of NTS OT-R signaling on food intake and energy expenditure control. Using a virally mediated OT-R knockdown (KD) strategy and a range of behavioral paradigms, this study examined the role of endogenous NTS OT-R signaling on satiation-mediated food intake inhibition and thermogenic control. Results showed that, compared with controls, NTS OT-R KD rats consumed larger meals, were less responsive to the intake-inhibitory effects of a self-ingested preload, and consumed more chow following a 24-hour fast. These data indicate that NTS OT-R signaling is necessary for normal satiation control. Whereas both control and NTS OT-R KD rats increased core temperature following high-fat diet maintenance (relative to chow maintenance), the percent increase in core temperature was greater in control compared with NTS OT-R KD rats during the light cycle. Hindbrain oxytocin agonist delivery increased core temperature in both control and NTS OT-R KD rats and the percent increase relative to vehicle treatment was not significantly different between groups. Together, data reveal a critical role for endogenous NTS OT-R signaling in mediating the intake-inhibitory effects of endogenous GI satiation signals and in diet-induced thermogenesis.",Effects of Endogenous Oxytocin Receptor Signaling in Nucleus Tractus Solitarius on Satiation-Mediated Feeding and Thermogenic Control in Male Rats.
"OPINION STATEMENT: Impaired sleep and alertness affect the majority of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, negatively impacting safety and quality of life. The etiology of impaired sleep-wake cycle in PD is multifactorial and encompasses medication side effects, nocturnal PD motor symptoms, and presence of co-existent sleep and neuropsychiatric disorders. The primary neurodegenerative process of PD involves brain regions that regulate the sleep-wake cycle, such as brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei. Sleep disorders in PD include insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sleep disordered breathing (SDB), restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian disruption. Despite its high prevalence in the PD population, there is a paucity of clinical studies that have investigated treatment of sleep dysfunction associated with PD. Therefore, we aim to review available evidence and outline treatment strategies for improvement of disorders of sleep and wakefulness in PD patients. Evidence supporting the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies in PD is limited. There is thus a great need but also opportunity for development of well-designed clinical trials for impaired sleep and alertness in PD. Providing education about sleep hygiene and strategies for its implementation represents the initial step in management. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of co-existent primary sleep and psychiatric disorders are critical, as this may significantly improve sleep and alertness. While the optimal treatment for insomnia in PD has not been established, available strategies include cognitive-behavioral therapy, medications with soporific properties, and light therapy. Safety measures, clonazepam, and melatonin are the mainstay of treatment for RBD. Continuous positive airway pressure is an effective treatment for SDB in PD. The treatment algorithm for RLS associated with PD mirrors that used for idiopathic RLS. Circadian disruption has emerged as an important etiology of impaired sleep-wake cycles in PD, and circadian-based interventions hold promise for novel treatment approaches.",Treatment of Sleep Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease.
"OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines recommend confirmatory testing for negative rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) for group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. We sought to describe the work of follow-up generated by this process and frequency of our inability to notify patients of positive results. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed laboratory and outreach nurse records of patients who had group A streptococcal pharyngitis testing performed in an academic pediatric emergency department during 2014. For patients with a negative RADT and subsequent positive backup direct nucleic acid probe test, we recorded whether the patient was successfully notified of the positive result, the number of contact attempts, and the time to antibiotic prescription. RESULTS: There were 6504 patients who had an RADT performed, of which 5474 (84.2%) were negative with a confirmatory test performed. There were 234 patients with positive confirmatory testing and not prescribed antibiotics at the time of the initial visit. Of these, 90.1% were ultimately contacted and prescribed appropriate antibiotics, whereas 7.3% were lost to follow-up and 2.6% had potentially unnecessary repeat visits. Of those contacted, 43.1% were reached only after multiple telephone calls or a letter. The median time from the negative RADT to the submission of an electronic prescription was 19.6 hours (interquartile range, 7.5-24.9 hours; range, 6-144 hours). CONCLUSIONS: Although confirmatory testing after a negative RADT in children is currently the standard of care, this practice requires a substantial amount of work. Furthermore, a significant fraction of patients are lost to follow-up or have unnecessary repeat visits.",The Challenge of Patient Notification and the Work of Follow-Up Generated by a 2-Step Testing Protocol for Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis in the Pediatric Emergency Department.
"The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative provides for the temporary deferral of enforcement of immigration laws for certain undocumented individuals brought to the United States before age 16. More than 50 medical schools now consider applicants who are DACA recipients, and medical school graduates with DACA are eligible to continue their training in graduate medical education. In this article, the authors summarize current policy and provide data on DACA recipients in medical school. They then review the implications for considering DACA recipients in graduate medical education, including employment guidelines, employer responsibilities, training at Veterans Affairs facilities, research funding, and professional licensure. They conclude by discussing the future of the DACA program and best practices for supporting students who are DACA recipients.First, there are no employment restrictions for DACA recipients with valid work authorization documents as long as their employers use Form I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification. Second, unlike H-1B or J-1 visa holders, DACA recipients do not generate additional immigration-related costs for their residency programs. Next, provisions in the Civil Rights Act prohibit employers from discriminating against applicants based on national origin or, in some cases, citizenship status. Furthermore, trainees with DACA are eligible to rotate through Veterans Affairs facilities. Finally, some states, like California and New York, have adopted policies and regulations allowing trainees with DACA who meet all professional requirements to receive a medical license. Given this state of affairs, DACA recipients should have equal standing to their peers when being evaluated for residency positions.",Considerations for Residency Programs Regarding Accepting Undocumented Students Who Are DACA Recipients.
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bullying is a significant public health concern, and it has received considerable attention from the media and policymakers over the past decade, which has led some to believe that it is increasing. However, there are limited surveillance data on bullying to inform our understanding of such trends over the course of multiple years. The current study examined the prevalence of bullying and related behaviors between 2005 and 2014 and explored whether any such changes varied across schools or as a function of school-level covariates. METHODS: Youth self-reports of 13 indicators of bullying and related behaviors were collected from 246 306 students in 109 Maryland schools across 10 years. The data were weighted to reflect the school populations and were analyzed by using longitudinal hierarchical linear modeling to examine changes over time. RESULTS: The covariate-adjusted models indicated a significant improvement over bullying and related concerns in 10 out of 13 indicators (including a decrease in bullying and victimization) for in-person forms (ie, physical, verbal, relational) and cyberbullying. Results also showed an increase in the perceptions that adults do enough to stop bullying and students' feelings of safety and belonging at school. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of bullying and related behaviors generally decreased over this 10-year period with the most recent years showing the greatest improvements in school climate and reductions in bullying. Additional research is needed to identify factors that contributed to this declining trend.",Ten-Year Trends in Bullying and Related Attitudes Among 4th- to 12th-Graders.
"The falling costs and increasing fidelity of high-throughput biomedical research data have led to a renaissance in cancer surveillance and treatment. Yet, the amount, velocity, and complexity of these data have overcome the capacity of the increasing number of researchers collecting and analyzing this information. By centralizing the data, processing power, and tools, there is a valuable opportunity to share resources and thus increase the efficiency, power, and impact of research. Herein, we describe current data commons and how they operate in the oncology landscape, including an overview of the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group data commons as a paradigm case. We outline the practical steps and considerations in building data commons. Finally, we discuss the unique opportunities and benefits of creating a data commons within the context of pediatric cancer research, highlighting the particular advantages for clinical oncology and suggested next steps.",Data Commons to Support Pediatric Cancer Research.
"Essentials Platelet microparticles play a major role in pathologies, including hemostasis and thrombosis. Platelet microparticles have been analyzed and classified based on their ultrastructure. The structure and intracellular origin of microparticles depend on the cell-activating stimulus. Thrombin-treated platelets fall apart and form microparticles that contain cellular organelles. SUMMARY: Background Platelet-derived microparticles comprise the major population of circulating blood microparticles that play an important role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Despite numerous studies on the (patho)physiological roles of platelet-derived microparticles, mechanisms of their formation and structural details remain largely unknown. Objectives Here we studied the formation, ultrastructure and composition of platelet-derived microparticles from isolated human platelets, either quiescent or stimulated with one of the following activators: arachidonic acid, ADP, collagen, thrombin or calcium ionophore A23187. Methods Using flow cytometry, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, we analyzed the intracellular origin, structural diversity and size distributions of the subcellular particles released from platelets. Results The structure, dimensions and intracellular origin of microparticles depend on the cell-activating stimulus. The main structural groups include a vesicle surrounded by one thin membrane or multivesicular structures. Thrombin, unlike other stimuli, induced formation of microparticles not only from the platelet plasma membrane and cytoplasm but also from intracellular structures. A fraction of these vesicular particles having an intracellular origin contained organelles, such as mitochondria, glycogen granules and vacuoles. The size of platelet-derived microparticles depended on the nature of the cell-activating stimulus. Conclusion The results obtained provide a structural basis for the qualitative differences of various platelet activators, for specific physiological and pathological effects of microparticles, and for development of advanced assays.",Intracellular origin and ultrastructure of platelet-derived microparticles.
"Identifying the pathways that control a cellular phenotype is the first step to building a mechanistic model. Recent examples in developmental biology, cancer genomics, and neurological disease have demonstrated how changes in the variability of gene expression can highlight important genes that are under different degrees of regulatory control. Simple statistical tests exist to identify differentially-variable genes; however, methods for investigating how changes in gene expression variability in the context of pathways and gene sets are under-explored. Here we present pathVar, a new method that provides functional interpretation of gene expression variability changes at the level of pathways and gene sets. pathVar is based on a multinomial exact test, or an asymptotic Chi-squared test as a more computationally-efficient alternative. The method can be used for gene expression studies from any technology platform in all biological settings either with a single phenotypic group, or two-group comparisons. To demonstrate its utility, we applied the method to a diverse set of diseases, species and samples. Results from pathVar are benchmarked against analyses based on average expression and two methods of GSEA, and demonstrate that analyses using both statistics are useful for understanding transcriptional regulation. We also provide recommendations for the choice of variability statistic that have been informed through analyses on simulations and real data. Based on the datasets selected, we show how pathVar can be used to gain insight into expression variability of single cell versus bulk samples, different stem cell populations, and cancer versus normal tissue comparisons.",pathVar: a new method for pathway-based interpretation of gene expression variability.
"PURPOSE: To investigate evidence for validity of faculty members' pediatric milestone (PM) ratings of interns (first-year residents) and subinterns (fourth-year medical students) on nine subcompetencies related to readiness to serve as a pediatric intern in the inpatient setting. METHOD: The Association of Pediatric Program Directors Longitudinal Educational Assessment Research Network (APPD LEARN) and the National Board of Medical Examiners collaborated to investigate the utility of assessments of the PMs for trainees' performance. Data from 32 subinterns and 179 interns at 17 programs were collected from July 2012 through April 2013. Observers used several tools to assess learners. At each site, a faculty member used these data to make judgments about the learner's current developmental milestone in each subcompetency. Linear mixed models were fitted to milestone judgments to examine their relationship with learner's rank and subcompetency. RESULTS: On a 5-point developmental scale, mean milestone levels for interns ranged from 3.20 (for the subcompetency Work effectively as a member of a team) to 3.72 (Humanism) and for subinterns from 2.89 (Organize and prioritize care) to 3.61 (Professionalization). Mean milestone ratings were significantly higher for the Professionalism competency (3.59-3.72) for all trainees compared with Patient Care (2.89-3.24) and Personal and Professional Development (3.33-3.51). Mean intern ratings were significantly higher than mean subintern ratings for all nine subcompetencies except Professionalization, Humanism, and Trustworthiness. CONCLUSIONS: The PMs had a coherent internal structure and could distinguish between differing levels of trainees, which supports their validation for documenting developmental progression of pediatric trainees.",Validity Evidence From Ratings of Pediatric Interns and Subinterns on a Subset of Pediatric Milestones.
"Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are among the most rigorous ways to determine the causal relationship between an intervention and important clinical outcome. Their use in veterinary medicine has become increasingly common, and as is often the case, with progress comes new challenges. Randomized clinical trials yield important answers, but results from these studies can be unhelpful or even misleading unless the study design and reporting are carried out with care. Herein, we offer some perspective on several emerging challenges associated with RCTs, including use of composite endpoints, the reporting of different forms of risk, analysis in the presence of missing data, and issues of reporting and safety assessment. These topics are explored in the context of previously reported veterinary internal medicine studies as well as through illustrative examples with hypothetical data sets. Moreover, many insights germane to RCTs in veterinary internal medicine can be drawn from the wealth of experience with RCTs in the human medical field. A better understanding of the issues presented here can help improve the design, interpretation, and reporting of veterinary RCTs.",Clinical Trials in Veterinary Medicine: A New Era Brings New Challenges.
"Studies on the pattern-based classification for invasive endocervical adenocarcinoma showed that tumors with nondestructive invasion (pattern-A) have a 0% rate of nodal metastases. Our understanding of pattern-A tumors and their distinction from in-situ adenocarcinoma requires further study. Thirteen sections diagnosed independently as pattern-A adenocarcinoma by three gynecologic pathologists, and 14 sections of benign endocervix were selected. Three additional pathologists (reviewers) evaluated a digital image from each section and classified it as pattern-A or benign based on architecture only. To blind the interpretation to cytologic features, nuclei and cytoplasm were obscured using morphometric software (Zen 2011, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Germany). 13/27 cases (48%; 8 pattern-A, 5 benign) were correctly classified by all reviewers; 19/27 (70%; 10 pattern-A, 9 benign) were correctly classified by >/=2 reviewers. 3/13 pattern-A cases (23%) were interpreted as benign by >/=2 reviewers. Conversely, 5/14 benign cervices (36%) were misinterpreted as pattern-A by >/=2 reviewers. The number of glands per 20x field was higher in pattern-A cases with high reviewer agreement (p=0.004). An abnormal architecture is seen in many pattern-A adenocarcinomas in support of their invasive nature; some, however, have architecture that overlaps with that of benign endocervix thus may actually represent in-situ lesions. Likewise, normal cervix can be architecturally complex and mirror patterns that pathologists would classify as pattern-A if malignant cytologic features were present. Based on this overlap and the nil risk of nodal spread, an emphasis on the non-destructive, rather than the invasive, nature of pattern-A adenocarcinoma is recommended.",Architectural overlap between benign endocervix and pattern-A endocervical adenocarcinoma: Are all pattern-A tumors invasive?
"With advances in genomic sequencing technology, the number of reported gene-disease relationships has rapidly expanded. However, the evidence supporting these claims varies widely, confounding accurate evaluation of genomic variation in a clinical setting. Despite the critical need to differentiate clinically valid relationships from less well-substantiated relationships, standard guidelines for such evaluation do not currently exist. The NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has developed a framework to define and evaluate the clinical validity of gene-disease pairs across a variety of Mendelian disorders. In this manuscript we describe a proposed framework to evaluate relevant genetic and experimental evidence supporting or contradicting a gene-disease relationship and the subsequent validation of this framework using a set of representative gene-disease pairs. The framework provides a semiquantitative measurement for the strength of evidence of a gene-disease relationship that correlates to a qualitative classification: ""Definitive,"" ""Strong,"" ""Moderate,"" ""Limited,"" ""No Reported Evidence,"" or ""Conflicting Evidence."" Within the ClinGen structure, classifications derived with this framework are reviewed and confirmed or adjusted based on clinical expertise of appropriate disease experts. Detailed guidance for utilizing this framework and access to the curation interface is available on our website. This evidence-based, systematic method to assess the strength of gene-disease relationships will facilitate more knowledgeable utilization of genomic variants in clinical and research settings.",Evaluating the Clinical Validity of Gene-Disease Associations: An Evidence-Based Framework Developed by the Clinical Genome Resource.
"BACKGROUND: Statin therapy is recommended for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Significant risk can remain because of insufficient clinical response or statin intolerance. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) therapy lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and has recently been shown to lower ASCVD events. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the barriers and challenges experienced with the access and approval reimbursement process for PCSK9 inhibitor prescriptions. METHODS: In 2016, the National Lipid Association conducted an online survey on PCSK9 inhibitor use and barriers to prescription among experienced healthcare workers who provide care to high-risk patients with ASCVD or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). RESULTS: There were 434 respondent healthcare workers with extensive experience in treating lipid disorders. PCSK9 inhibitors are considered by 71.3% of respondent providers with statin-intolerant patients. There were high rates (>85%) of initial denial. The major barriers to approvals were insurer processes, provider documentation (inadequate documentation of maximally tolerated statin dose, diagnostic criteria for FH, number of statins failed if statin intolerant and most recent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and administrative burden (time, staff, paperwork, and appeals). Provider approval rates for getting >/=75% patients approved were higher for FH (43%) than for ASCVD patients (36%). Among providers with good approval rates, documentation was the most critical factor. Barriers more difficult to overcome include perceived higher threshold requirements by payers, drugs not on formulary, and drug costs. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers encounter significant barriers to PCSK9 inhibitor prescriptions; many of these are related to documentation issues and can be overcome with checklists, staff support, and experience.",Barriers to PCSK9 inhibitor prescriptions for patients with high cardiovascular risk: Results of a healthcare provider survey conducted by the National Lipid Association.
"PURPOSE: In the setting of acute deep upper extremity infections, evidence is lacking to guide the decision whether to send atypical cultures (fungal and acid-fast-bacillus [AFB]) during surgical debridement, especially in the presence of purulent fluid that is commonly observed with typical bacterial infections. Our purpose was to determine the frequency of positive atypical cultures and the frequency with which they alter treatment, and identify factors associated with positive atypical cultures. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 100 adult patients undergoing surgical debridement of acute deep infections of the upper extremity in which fungal and/or AFB cultures were sent. Necrotizing and superficial infections were excluded. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patient characteristics, infection diagnoses, number of cultures sent with corresponding rates of positivity, and treatments. Cohorts with positive and negative atypical cultures were compared with bivariate analysis for all collected variables. RESULTS: One or more immunocompromising comorbidities were present in 46% of patients. Diagnoses included soft tissue abscess (46%), suppurative flexor tenosynovitis (22%), septic arthritis (21%), osteomyelitis (9%), and septic bursitis (2%). Aerobic bacterial, anaerobic bacterial, fungal, and AFB cultures were sent in 100%, 99%, 94%, and 82% of patients, respectively. Corresponding rates of positivity were 74%, 34.3%, 5.3%, and 2.4%, respectively. Atypical cultures were positive for 7% of patients and 2.9% of all atypical tests sent. Antibiotic treatment was influenced by atypical culture data for 4% of patients. For patients with positive atypical cultures, purulence was observed during surgery in 86% of cases. Bivariate analysis demonstrated symptom duration greater than 7 days as potentially associated with atypical culture positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative purulence at the time of surgical intervention should not deter the surgeon from obtaining atypical cultures. As expected, atypical cultures are infrequently positive given the rarity of associated diseases. Symptoms greater than 7 days may predict a higher incidence of atypical culture positivity for patients being treated surgically within 30 days of initial symptom onset.

"Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, and its prevalence has been projected to grow by 40% in the next decade. This increasing prevalence has implications for the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and also for Chronic kidney disease. A high body mass index is one of the strongest risk factors for new-onset Chronic kidney disease. In individuals affected by obesity, a compensatory hyperfiltration occurs to meet the heightened metabolic demands of the increased body weight. The increase in intraglomerular pressure can damage the kidneys and raise the risk of developing Chronic kidney disease in the long-term. The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy has increased ten-fold in recent years. Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis, and for a number of malignancies including kidney cancer. This year the World Kidney Day promotes education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyle and health policy measures that makes preventive behaviors an affordable option.",Obesity and kidney disease: hidden consequences of the epidemic.
"OBJECTIVE: To compare major depression risk among young adults with juvenile-onset and adult-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to determine demographic and health-related predictors of depression. METHODS: Young adults with SLE ages 18-45 years (n = 546) in the Lupus Outcomes Study completed annual telephone surveys from 2002-2015, including assessment of depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and self-report measures of sociodemographics and health characteristics. Juvenile-onset SLE was defined as age <18 years at diagnosis (n = 115). Repeated-measures analysis was performed to assess the risk for major depression (CES-D >/=24) at any point in study, and logistic regression was used to assess for recurrent (present on >/=2 assessments) major depression. RESULTS: Major depression was experienced by 47% of the cohort at least once during the 12-year study period. In adjusted analyses, juvenile-onset SLE patients had an increased risk of having a major depressive episode (odds ratio [OR] 1.7 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0-2.7]) and recurrent episodes (OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.2-4.3]), compared to participants with adult-onset SLE. Older age, lower educational attainment, and physical function, higher disease activity, and a history of smoking were associated with an increased depression risk. Juvenile-onset SLE patients had a higher risk of major depression across all educational groups. CONCLUSION: Young adults with SLE, particularly those with juvenile-onset disease, are at high risk for major depression, which is associated with increased disease activity, poorer physical functioning, and lower educational attainment. Early depression intervention in young adults with SLE has the potential to improve both medical and psychosocial outcomes.",Depression Risk in Young Adults With Juvenile- and Adult-Onset Lupus: Twelve Years of Followup.

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in developmental assessments using the current version of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Bayley-III) as compared to the older BSID-II. Previous studies suggest that average scores on the Bayley-III may be significantly higher than scores on the previous version, but the magnitude and potential impact of differences between these 2 assessments are uncertain. METHODS: We enrolled 77 former preterm infants (born <32 wk gestation and </=2000 g) at 18 to 22 months corrected age in this randomized crossover study. The Bayley-III was administered in follow-up clinic per standard of care. The BSID-II was administered during a separate study visit. The order of testing was randomly assigned. The assessments were performed 4 to 8 weeks apart by masked personnel. The main outcomes were mean difference between BSID-II Mental Development Index (MDI) and Bayley-III Cognitive Composite score, mean difference between BSID-II Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) and Bayley-III Motor Composite score, and difference in the proportion of infants classified as having ""developmental delay."" RESULTS: Bayley-III scores were significantly higher across the range of scores and in all domains. Mean Cognitive Composite scores were almost 1 SD higher than MDI scores (14.1 +/- 12.9 points, p < .001). Mean Motor Composite scores were 9.0 +/- 11.9 points higher than PDI scores (p < .001). When severity of delay was classified using standardized cut-points for moderate and severe developmental delay (1 and 2 SDs below reference norm), 40% of children (n = 31/77) were classified as less severely delayed with the Bayley-III Cognitive Composite score than with the BSID-II MDI, whereas only 1 (<2%) was classified as more severely delayed with the Bayley-III (p < .001). CONCLUSION: These findings have critical implications for both the interpretation of clinical research studies and determination of eligibility for services in high-risk children.",Counterbalanced Comparison of the BSID-II and Bayley-III at Eighteen to Twenty-two Months Corrected Age.
"BACKGROUND: Non-coding RNAs have been drawing increasing attention in recent years as functional data suggest that they play important roles in key cellular processes. N-BLR is a primate-specific long non-coding RNA that modulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, facilitates cell migration, and increases colorectal cancer invasion. RESULTS: We performed multivariate analyses of data from two independent cohorts of colorectal cancer patients and show that the abundance of N-BLR is associated with tumor stage, invasion potential, and overall patient survival. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments we found that N-BLR facilitates migration primarily via crosstalk with E-cadherin and ZEB1. We showed that this crosstalk is mediated by a pyknon, a short ~20 nucleotide-long DNA motif contained in the N-BLR transcript and is targeted by members of the miR-200 family. In light of these findings, we used a microarray to investigate the expression patterns of other pyknon-containing genomic loci. We found multiple such loci that are differentially transcribed between healthy and diseased tissues in colorectal cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, we identified several new loci whose expression correlates with the colorectal cancer patients' overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The primate-specific N-BLR is a novel molecular contributor to the complex mechanisms that underlie metastasis in colorectal cancer and a potential novel biomarker for this disease. The presence of a functional pyknon within N-BLR and the related finding that many more pyknon-containing genomic loci in the human genome exhibit tissue-specific and disease-specific expression suggests the possibility of an alternative class of biomarkers and therapeutic targets that are primate-specific.","N-BLR, a primate-specific non-coding transcript leads to colorectal cancer invasion and migration."
"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare, heritable, small vessel vascular disease caused by mutations in the Notch3 gene that is characterized by migraines, subcortical vascular events, cognitive decline, and mood disturbances. However, many CADASIL cases present with unusual symptoms such as status epilepticus, a movement disorder, or sensory dysfunction. This study describes the clinical, genetic, and radiologic characteristics of a Peruvian family with CADASIL in which multiple family members presented with severe olfactory deficits. Seven members of the family have symptoms suggestive of CADASIL, with genetic testing revealing R133C mutations in the two patients who underwent genetic testing. Cognitive testing and olfactory identification testing (Smell Identification Test) were performed in three CADASIL patients revealing total anosmia in two tested patients and severe hyposmia in the other. Olfactory dysfunction has been associated with various neurologic and psychiatric conditions though few studies have linked it with neurovascular disorders such as CADASIL. This first reported case of CADASIL in Peru emphasizes that symptomatic olfactory dysfunction may be an unusual presentation of CADASIL and that olfactory dysfunction is important to evaluate in CADASIL patients.",The First Report of CADASIL in Peru: Olfactory Dysfunction on Initial Presentation.

"BACKGROUND: There is a pressing workforce shortage and leadership scarcity in palliative care to adequately meet the demands of individuals with serious illness and their families. To address this gap, the Cambia Health Foundation launched its Sojourns Scholars Leadership Program in 2014, an initiative designed to identify, cultivate, and advance the next generation of palliative care leaders. This report intends to summarize the second cohort of Sojourns Scholars' projects and their reflection on their leadership needs. OBJECTIVE: This report summarizes the second cohort of sojourns scholars' project and their reflection on leadership needs. METHODS: After providing a written reflection on their own projects, the second cohort participated in a group interview (fireside chat) to elicit their perspectives on barriers and facilitators in providing palliative care, issues facing leadership in palliative care in the United States, and lessons from personal and professional growth as leaders in palliative care. They analyzed the transcript of the group interview using qualitative content analysis methodology. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from descriptions of the scholars' project experience: challenges in palliative care practice, leadership strategies in palliative care, and three lessons learned to be a leader were identified. Challenges included perceptions of palliative care, payment and policy, and workforce development. Educating and collaborating with other clinicians and influencing policy change are important strategies used to advance palliative care. Time management, leading team effort, and inspiring others are important skills that promote effectiveness as a leader. DISCUSSION: Emerging leaders have a unique view of conceptualizing contemporary palliative care and shaping the future. CONCLUSIONS: Providing comprehensive, coordinated care that is high quality, patient and family centered, and readily available depends on strong leadership in palliative care. The Cambia Scholars Program represents a unique opportunity.",The Cambia Sojourns Scholars Leadership Program: Conversations with Emerging Leaders in Palliative Care.
"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine is a rapidly evolving form of modern information and communication technology used to deliver clinical services and educational activities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to report and analyze our experience with transatlantic consultation via videoconferencing in pediatric cardiology. METHODS: In February, 2013, videoconferencing project was launched between a medium-volume pediatric cardiac center in Bratislava, Slovakia and subspecialty experts from a high-volume pediatric cardiac program at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), USA. During 1.5-2 hours videoconferences, 2-3 patients with similar complex clinical scenarios were presented to CHOP experts. The main goal of the project was consultation on individual patients to validate, alter or radically change clinical management plans. RESULTS: From February, 2013 to January, 2017, 25 videoconferences occurred and 73 cases were discussed. The median patient age was 52 months (range; 1 day-30 years). Forty-six discussed cases were outpatients, 21 patients were in the intensive care unit and 6 patients were discussed post mortem. Thirty-one CHOP experts from different subspecialties participated actively in patient consultations. The most frequent recommendations were related to single ventricle, pulmonary hypertension or heart failure patients and intervention in complex and/or rare cardiac diseases. Specialists from CHOP agreed completely with the original care plan in 16% of cases. In 52% cases, adjustments to original plan were suggested. Radical changes were recommended in 30% of cases. Receiving institution adopted recommendations to the patient care fully in 79% and partially in 13% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our 4-year experience we consider videoconferencing between medium-size pediatric cardiac center and subspecialty experts from a high-volume pediatric cardiac program a suitable form of medical consultations. Videoconferencing assists in clinical decision making for complex patient cases and serves as an effective educational tool to gain knowledge and experience ""without borders.""",Transatlantic medical consultation and second opinion in pediatric cardiology has benefit past patient care: A case study in videoconferencing.
"BACKGROUND: Increased hemoglobin (Hb) concentration accompanying hypoxemia is a compensatory response to maintain tissue oxygen delivery. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is used clinically to detect abnormalities in the balance of cerebral tissue oxygen delivery and consumption, including in children with congenital heart disease (CHD). Although NIRS-measured cerebral tissue O2 saturation (ScO2) correlates with arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), jugular bulb O2 saturation (SjbO2), and Hb, little data exist on the interplay between these factors and cerebral O2 extraction (COE). This study investigated the associations of ScO2 and DeltaSaO2-ScO2 with SaO2 and Hb and verified the normal range of ScO2 in children with CHD. METHODS: Children undergoing cardiac catheterization for CHD were enrolled in a calibration and validation study of the FORE-SIGHT NIRS monitor. Two pairs of simultaneous arterial and jugular bulb samples were drawn for co-oximetry, calculation of a reference ScO2 (REF CX), and estimation of COE. Pearson correlation and linear regression were used to determine relationships between O2 saturation parameters and Hb. Data were also analyzed according to diagnostic group defined as acyanotic (SaO2 >/= 90%) and cyanotic (SaO2 < 90%). RESULTS: Of 65 children studied, acceptable jugular bulb samples (SjbO2 absolute difference between samples </=10%) were obtained in 57 (88%). The DeltaSaO2-SjbO2, DeltaSaO2-ScO2, and DeltaSaO2-REF CX were positively correlated with SaO2 and negatively correlated with Hb (all P < .001). Although by diagnostic group ScO2 differed statistically (P = .002), values in the cyanotic patients were within the range considered normal (69% +/- 6%). COE estimated by the difference between arterial and jugular bulb O2 content (DeltaCaO2-CjbO2, mL O2/100 mL) was not different for cyanotic and acyanotic patients (P = .10), but estimates using DeltaSaO2-SjbO2, DeltaSaO2-ScO2, or DeltaSaO2-ScO2/SaO2 were significantly different between the cyanotic and acyanotic children (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Children with adequately compensated chronic hypoxemia appear to have ScO2 values within the normal range. The DeltaSaO2-ScO2 is inversely related to Hb, with the implication that in the presence of reduced Hb, particularly if coupled with a decreased cardiac output, the ScO2 can fall to values associated with brain injury in laboratory studies.",Cerebral Oxygen Saturation in Children With Congenital Heart Disease and Chronic Hypoxemia.

"Differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) into myelinating oligodendrocytes is known to be regulated by the microenvironment where they differentiate. However, current research has not verified whether or not oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLCs) derived from different anatomical regions of the central nervous system (CNS) respond to microenvironmental cues in the same manner. Here, we isolated pure OPCs from rat neonatal forebrain (FB) and spinal cord (SC) and compared their phenotypes in the same in vitro conditions. We found that although FB and SC OLCs responded differently to the same external factors; they were distinct in proliferation response to mitogens, oligodendrocyte phenotype after differentiation, and cytotoxic responses to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate-type glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity at immature stages of differentiation in a cell-intrinsic manner. Moreover, transcriptome analysis identified genes differentially expressed between these OPC populations, including those encoding transcription factors (TFs), cell surface molecules, and signaling molecules. Particularly, FB and SC OPCs retained the expression of FB- or SC-specific TFs, such as Foxg1 and Hoxc8, respectively, even after serial passaging in vitro. Given the essential role of these TFs in the regional identities of CNS cells along the rostrocaudal axis, our results suggest that CNS region-specific gene regulation by these TFs may cause cell-intrinsic differences in cellular responses between FB and SC OLCs to extracellular molecules. Further understanding of the regional differences among OPC populations will help to improve treatments for demyelination in different CNS regions and to facilitate the development of stem cell-derived OPCs for cell transplantation therapies for demyelination.

"Molecular and circuit mechanisms for balancing competing drives are not well understood. While circadian and homeostatic mechanisms generally ensure sufficient sleep at night, other pressing needs can overcome sleep drive. Here, we demonstrate that the balance between sleep and sex drives determines whether male flies sleep or court, and identify a subset of octopaminergic neurons (MS1) that regulate sleep specifically in males. When MS1 neurons are activated, isolated males sleep less, and when MS1 neurons are silenced, the normal male sleep suppression in female presence is attenuated and mating behavior is impaired. MS1 neurons do not express the sexually dimorphic FRUITLESS (FRU) transcription factor, but form male-specific contacts with FRU-expressing neurons; calcium imaging experiments reveal bidirectional functional connectivity between MS1 and FRU neurons. We propose octopaminergic MS1 neurons interact with the FRU network to mediate sleep suppression by male sex drive.",Identification of octopaminergic neurons that modulate sleep suppression by male sex drive.
"OBJECTIVES: To conduct psychometric analyses to condense the Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) into a shorter form termed the Hot Flash Interference (HFI) scale; evaluate cut-points for both scales; and establish minimally important differences (MIDs) for both scales. METHODS: We analyzed baseline and postrandomization patient-reported data pooled across three randomized trials aimed at reducing vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in 899 midlife women. Trials were conducted across five MsFLASH clinical sites between July 2009 and October 2012. We eliminated HFRDIS items based on experts' content validity ratings and confirmatory factor analysis, and evaluated cut-points and established MIDs by mapping HFRDIS and HFI to other measures. RESULTS: The three-item HFI (interference with sleep, mood, and concentration) demonstrated strong internal consistency (alphas of 0.830 and 0.856), showed good fit to the unidimensional ""hot flash interference factor,"" and strong convergent validity with HFRDIS scores, diary VMS, and menopausal quality of life. For both scales, cut-points of mild (0-3.9), moderate (4-6.9), and severe (7-10) interference were associated with increasing diary VMS ratings, sleep, and anxiety. The average MID was 1.66 for the HFRDIS and 2.34 for the HFI. CONCLUSIONS: The HFI is a brief assessment of VMS interference and will be useful in busy clinics to standardize VMS assessment or in research studies where response burden may be an issue. The scale cut-points and MIDs should prove useful in targeting those most in need of treatment, monitoring treatment response, and interpreting existing and future research findings.","Validity, cut-points, and minimally important differences for two hot flash-related daily interference scales."
"Biomphalaria snails are instrumental in transmission of the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni. With the World Health Organization's goal to eliminate schistosomiasis as a global health problem by 2025, there is now renewed emphasis on snail control. Here, we characterize the genome of Biomphalaria glabrata, a lophotrochozoan protostome, and provide timely and important information on snail biology. We describe aspects of phero-perception, stress responses, immune function and regulation of gene expression that support the persistence of B. glabrata in the field and may define this species as a suitable snail host for S. mansoni. We identify several potential targets for developing novel control measures aimed at reducing snail-mediated transmission of schistosomiasis.",Whole genome analysis of a schistosomiasis-transmitting freshwater snail.
"BACKGROUND: Pediatric delirium assessment is complicated by variations in baseline language and cognitive skills, impairment during illness, and absence of pediatric-specific modifiers within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders delirium criterion. OBJECTIVE: To develop a standardized approach to pediatric delirium assessment by psychiatrists. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of clinicians used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual criterion as the foundation for the Vanderbilt Assessment for Delirium in Infants and Children (VADIC). Pediatric-specific modifiers were integrated into the delirium criterion, including key developmental and assessment variations for children. The VADIC was used in clinical practice to prospectively assess critically ill infants and children. The VADIC was assessed for content validity by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Delirium Special Interest Group. RESULTS: The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry-Delirium Special Interest Group determined that the VADIC demonstrated high content validity. The VADIC (1) preserved the core Diagnostic and Statistical Manual delirium criterion, (2) appropriately paired interactive assessments with key criterion based on development, and (3) addressed confounders for delirium. A cohort of 300 patients with a median age of 20 months was assessed for delirium using the VADIC. Delirium prevalence was 47%. CONCLUSION: The VADIC provides a comprehensive framework to standardize pediatric delirium assessment by psychiatrists. The need for consistency in both delirium education and diagnosis is highlighted given the high prevalence of pediatric delirium.",Development of the Vanderbilt Assessment for Delirium in Infants and Children to Standardize Pediatric Delirium Assessment By Psychiatrists.
"BACKGROUND: Acne is a chronic dermatological disease predominantly afflicting young adults and is often associated with the development of scars. Acne scarring is usually avoidable when acne is managed early and effectively. However, acne patients often fail to seek early treatment. New and innovative tools to raise awareness are needed. OBJECTIVE: This study presents the development and assessment of a tool aiming to assess the risk of atrophic acne scars. METHODS: A systematic literature review of clinical risk factors for acne scars, a Delphi-like survey of dermatological experts in acne and secondary data analysis, were conducted to produce an evidence-based risk assessment tool. The tool was assessed both with a sample of young adults with and without scars and was assessed via a database cross-validation. RESULTS: A self-administered tool for risk assessment of developing atrophic acne scars in young adults was developed. It is a readily comprehensible and practical tool for population education and for use in medical practices. It comprises of four risk factors: worst ever severity of acne, duration of acne, family history of atrophic acne scars and lesion manipulation behaviours. It provides a dichotomous outcome: lower vs. higher risk of developing scars, thereby categorizing nearly two-thirds of the population correctly, with sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 43%. CONCLUSION: The present tool was developed as a response to current challenges in acne scar prevention. A potential benefit is to encourage those at risk to self-identify and to seek active intervention of their acne. In clinical practice, we expect this tool may help clinicians identify patients at risk of atrophic acne scarring and underscore their requirement for rapid and effective acne treatment.",Development of an atrophic acne scar risk assessment tool.
"OBJECTIVES: To define clinical correlates of low voltage isolated to precordial leads on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). INTRODUCTION: Low voltage (V) on the ECG is defined as QRS V<5mm in all limb leads and <10mm in all precordial leads. The diagnostic use of ECGs with low voltage isolated to the precordial leads with normal limb lead voltages is unclear. METHODS: Twelve-lead ECGs with QRS V>5mm in one or more limb leads and <10mm in all precordial leads were collected. Associated clinical conditions were determined from clinical data, echocardiograms, and chest radiographs. RESULTS: Low precordial voltage was found in 256 of 150,000 ECGs (~0.2%). 50.4% of patients had discordant ECGs that correlated with classic etiologies, with a higher incidence of LV dilation in those with classic etiologies than those without. CONCLUSION: Low precordial voltage is associated with classic etiologies and LV dilation.",Electrocardiogram voltage discordance: Interpretation of low QRS voltage only in the precordial leads.

"OBJECTIVE: Video (indirect) laryngoscopy is used as a primary tracheal intubation device for difficult airways in emergency departments and in adult ICUs. The use and outcomes of video laryngoscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy has not been quantified in PICUs or cardiac ICUs. DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively collected observational data from a multicenter tracheal intubation database (National Emergency Airway Registry for Children) from July 2010 to June 2015. SETTING: Thirty-six PICUs/cardiac ICUs across the United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore. PATIENTS: Any patient admitted to a PICU or a pediatric cardiac ICU and undergoing tracheal intubation. INTERVENTIONS: Use of direct laryngoscopy versus video laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 8,875 tracheal intubations reported in the National Emergency Airway Registry for Children database, including 7,947 (89.5%) tracheal intubations performed using direct laryngoscopy and 928 (10.5%) tracheal intubations performed using video laryngoscopy. Wide variability in video laryngoscopy use exists across PICUs (median, 2.6%; range, 0-55%). Video laryngoscopy was more often used in older children (p < 0.001), in children with history of a difficult airway (p = 0.01), in children intubated for ventilatory failure (p < 0.001), and to facilitate the completion of an elective procedure (p = 0.048). After adjusting for patient-level covariates, a secular trend, and site-level variance, the use of video laryngoscopy significantly increased over a 5-year period compared with fiscal year 2011 (odds ratio, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.7-26.8 for fiscal year 2014 and odds ratio, 11.2; 95% CI, 3.2-38.9 for fiscal year 2015). The use of video laryngoscopy was independently associated with a lower occurrence of tracheal intubation adverse events (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42-0.77; p < 0.001) but not with a lower occurrence of severe tracheal intubation adverse events (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.56-1.32; p = 0.49) or fewer multiple attempts at endotracheal intubation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.71-1.22; p = 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Using National Emergency Airway Registry for Children data, we described patient-centered adverse outcomes associated with video laryngoscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in the largest reported international cohort of children to date. Data from this study may be used to design sufficiently powered prospective studies comparing patient-centered outcomes for video laryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy during endotracheal intubation.",Trend and Outcomes of Video Laryngoscope Use Across PICUs.
"OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this study were to describe in-hospital acute respiratory compromise among children (< 18 yr old), and its association with cardiac arrest and in-hospital mortality. DESIGN: Observational study using prospectively collected data. SETTING: U.S. hospitals reporting data to the ""Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation"" registry. PATIENTS: Pediatric patients (< 18 yr old) with acute respiratory compromise. Acute respiratory compromise was defined as absent, agonal, or inadequate respiration that required emergency assisted ventilation and elicited a hospital-wide or unit-based emergency response. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Cardiac arrest during the event was a secondary outcome. To assess the association between patient, event, and hospital characteristics and the outcomes, we created multivariable logistic regressions models accounting for within-hospital clustering. One thousand nine hundred fifty-two patients from 151 hospitals were included. Forty percent of the events occurred on the wards, 19% in the emergency department, 25% in the ICU, and 16% in other locations. Two hundred eighty patients (14.6%) died before hospital discharge. Preexisting hypotension (odds ratio, 3.26 [95% CI, 1.89-5.62]; p < 0.001) and septicemia (odds ratio, 2.46 [95% CI, 1.52-3.97]; p < 0.001) were associated with increased mortality. The acute respiratory compromise event was temporally associated with a cardiac arrest in 182 patients (9.3%), among whom 46.2% died. One thousand two hundred eight patients (62%) required tracheal intubation during the event. In-hospital mortality among patients requiring tracheal intubation during the event was 18.6%. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, multicenter study of acute respiratory compromise, 40% occurred in ward settings, 9.3% had an associated cardiac arrest, and overall in-hospital mortality was 14.6%. Preevent hypotension and septicemia were associated with increased mortality rate.",Pediatric In-Hospital Acute Respiratory Compromise: A Report From the American Heart Association's Get With the Guidelines-Resuscitation Registry.
"BACKGROUND: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the roles of SPECT, PET, and MRS in distinguishing primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) from other focal brain lesions (FBLs) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Medline were systematically searched for eligible studies from 1980 to 2016. Two authors extracted characteristics of patients and their lesions using predefined criteria. RESULTS: Eighteen studies on SPECT containing 667 patients, 6 studies on PET containing 108 patients, and 3 studies on MRS containing 96 patients were included. SPECT had a pooled sensitivity of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85-0.96) and specificity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74-0.90) in differentiating PCNSL from other FBLs. For the 6 studies that used only pathology and/or serology as the gold standard, the pooled sensitivity was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.72-0.97) and the pooled specificity was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.54-0.92). CONCLUSION: SPECT has good diagnostic accuracy for discriminating PCNSL from other FBL-causing disorders in HIV patients. However, the actual sensitivity and specificity of SPECT may be lower than expected if only pathology and/or serology was used as the gold standard. PET may be superior but has less supporting clinical data and is more expensive.","Diagnostic accuracy of SPECT, PET, and MRS for primary central nervous system lymphoma in HIV patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis."
"Global expression profiling of neurologic or psychiatric disorders has been confounded by variability among laboratories, animal models, tissues sampled, and experimental platforms, with the result being that few genes demonstrate consistent expression changes. We attempted to minimize these confounds by pooling dentate granule cell transcriptional profiles from 164 rats in seven laboratories, using three status epilepticus (SE) epilepsy models (pilocarpine, kainate, self-sustained SE), plus amygdala kindling. In each epilepsy model, RNA was harvested from laser-captured dentate granule cells from six rats at four time points early in the process of developing epilepsy, and data were collected from two independent laboratories in each rodent model except SSSE. Hierarchical clustering of differentially-expressed transcripts in the three SE models revealed complete separation between controls and SE rats isolated 1 day after SE. However, concordance of gene expression changes in the SE models was only 26-38% between laboratories, and 4.5% among models, validating the consortium approach. Transcripts with unusually highly variable control expression across laboratories provide a 'red herring' list for low-powered studies.",Transcriptional profile of hippocampal dentate granule cells in four rat epilepsy models.
"BACKGROUND: Tumors of the spine in children are rare, and further clinical description is necessary. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated epidemiology, interventions, and outcomes of pediatric patients with spine and spinal cord tumors. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample and Kids' Inpatient Database were used for the study. Outcomes were studied, and bivariate significant trends were analyzed in a multivariate setting. RESULTS: Analysis of 2870 patients between 2000 and 2009 found a median age of diagnosis of 11 years (Tables 1 and 2). Most were white (65.2%) and had private insurance (62.3%), and 46.8% of procedures were emergent operations. Treatment occurred at teaching (93.6%) and non-children's hospitals (81.1%). Overall mortality rate was 1.7%, non-routine discharges occurred at a rate 19.9%, complications at 21.1%, and average total charges were $66,087. A majority of patients (87.5%) had no intervention, and of those patients receiving treatment, 78.2% underwent surgery and 23.1% had radiotherapy. Treatment with surgery alone increased significantly over time (p < 0.0001). Odds ratio (OR) of mortality was significantly higher in 2006 (OR 3.5) and 2009 (OR 2.6) when compared to 2000. Complications (OR 7.9) and disease comorbidities (OR 1.5) were associated with significantly increased odds of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital characteristics, length of stay, and charges remained relatively unchanged. In recent years, there has been a decreasing incidence of spine and spinal cord tumors in children. Notably, a higher mortality rate is evident over time in addition to an increase in the proportion of patients undergoing surgery. The high percentage of emergent operations suggests a weak recognition of spine tumors in children and should prompt a call for increased awareness of this cancer. In spite of these findings, lack of tumor type identification was a limitation to this study.",Treatment patterns of children with spine and spinal cord tumors: national outcomes and review of the literature.
"BACKGROUND: CYP2B6 polymorphisms that affect efavirenz (EFV) concentrations are common, but the effect of this polymorphism on HIV virologic failure in clinical practice settings has not fully been elucidated. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between the CYP2B6 516G>T genotype and late virologic failure in patients treated with EFV in Gaborone, Botswana. SETTING: We performed a case-control study that included 1338 HIV-infected black Batswana on EFV-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). Patients were approached for enrollment during regular visits at one of the outpatient HIV clinics between July 2013 and April 2014. METHODS: Cases experienced late HIV failure, defined as plasma HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL after maintaining viral suppression (<400 copies/mL) for at least 6 months. For each case, a total of 4 control patients were randomly sampled from the same population. Controls had plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL on ART for at least 6 months. Logistic regression was used to determine the adjusted odds of late HIV failure by 516G>T genotype. RESULTS: After adjustment for the confounding variables age and CD4 count, the CYP2B6 516 T-allele was protective against late HIV virologic breakthrough, adjusted OR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.97. CONCLUSION: The CYP2B6 516 T-allele was protective against late virologic breakthrough in patients with initial (6 month) HIV RNA suppression on EFV-based ART. Future studies are needed to assess long-term viral benefits of identifying and offering EFV containing ART to black African HIV-infected patients with CYP2B6 T-alleles, especially given the wider availability of a single pill EFV in this setting.",Brief Report: CYP2B6 516G>T Minor Allele Protective of Late Virologic Failure in Efavirenz-Treated HIV-Infected Patients in Botswana.
"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2016 Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Progress Report documented no change in catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) between 2009 and 2014.

"BACKGROUND: The Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) is an atypical receptor that regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the role of DARC in asthma pathophysiology is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of DARC in allergic airways disease in mice, and the association between DARC single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and clinical outcomes in patients with asthma. METHODS: Mice with targeted disruption of the Darc gene (Darc(E2) ) or WT mice were challenged over 3 weeks with house dust mite (HDM) antigen. Allergic airways disease was assessed 24 hours and 7 days following the final challenge. Additionally, associations between DARC SNPs and clinical outcomes were analysed in a cohort of poorly controlled asthmatics. RESULTS: Total airway inflammation following HDM did not differ between Darc(E2) and WT mice. At 24 hours, Darc(E2) mice had increased airway hyperresponsiveness; however, at 7 days airway hyperresponsiveness had completely resolved in Darc(E2) but persisted in WT mice. In poorly controlled asthmatics, DARC SNPs were associated with worse asthma control at randomization and subsequent increased risk of healthcare utilization (odds ratio 3.13(1.37-7.27), P=.0062). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our animal model and human patient data suggest a novel role for DARC in the temporal regulation in asthma pathophysiology and symptoms.",The Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines regulates asthma pathophysiology.
"Adaptive and innate immunity utilize the perforin-killing pathway to eliminate virus-infected or cancer cells. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer cells mediate this process by releasing toxic proteins at the contact area with target cells known as immunological synapse (IS). Formation of a stable IS and exocytosis of toxic proteins requires persistent fusion of Rab11a recycling endosomes with the plasma membrane (PM) that may assure the delivery of key effector proteins. Despite the importance of the recycling endosomal compartment, the membrane fusion proteins that control this process at the IS remain elusive. Here, by performing knockdown experiments we found that syntaxin 4 (STX4) is necessary for cytotoxic activity and CD107a degranulation against target cells in a similar fashion to syntaxin 11, which is involved in lytic granule (LG) exocytosis and immunodeficiency when it is mutated. Using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy we identified that STX4 mediates fusion of EGFP-Rab11a vesicles at the IS. Immunoprecipitation experiments in lysates of activated CTLs indicate that endogenous STX4 may drive this fusion step by interacting with cognate proteins: Munc18-3/SNAP23/VAMP7 and/or VAMP8. These results reveal the role of STX4 in mediating fusion of Rab11a endosomes upstream of lytic granules (LGs) exocytosis and further demonstrate the importance of this pathway in controlling CTL-mediated cytotoxicity.",Syntaxin 4 mediates endosome recycling for lytic granule exocytosis in cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.
"Thymic regulatory T cells (tTregs) and induced regulatory T cells (iTregs) suppress murine acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Previously, we demonstrated that the plasmacytoid dendritic cell indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) fosters the in vitro development of human iTregs via tryptophan depletion and kynurenine (Kyn) metabolites. We now show that stimulation of naive CD4(+) T cells in low tryptophan (low Trp) plus Kyn supports human iTreg generation. In vitro, low Trp + Kyn iTregs and tTregs potently suppress T effector cell proliferation equivalently but are phenotypically distinct. Compared with tTregs or T effector cells, bioenergetics profiling reveals that low Trp + Kyn iTregs have increased basal glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and use glutaminolysis as an energy source. Low Trp + Kyn iTreg viability was reliant on interleukin (IL)-2 in vitro. Although in vivo IL-2 administration increased low Trp + Kyn iTreg persistence on adoptive transfer into immunodeficient mice given peripheral blood mononuclear cells to induce GVHD, IL-2-supported iTregs did not improve recipient survival. We conclude that low Trp + Kyn create suppressive iTregs that have high metabolic needs that will need to be addressed before clinical translation.",In Vitro Induction of Human Regulatory T Cells Using Conditions of Low Tryptophan Plus Kynurenines.
"The contributions of histologic features including microvascular proliferation to the determination of malignancy in oligodendrogliomas remain uncertain. We have retrospectively performed morphometric assessments in 20 tumors histologically classified as well-differentiated (WHO Grade II, n=8) or anaplastic (WHO Grade III, n=12) oligodendrogliomas (WDO or AO). Quantitative studies utilized image analysis of double immunolabeled vasculature with anti CD34 with VIP chromogen (purple) and proliferating nuclei with anti MIB-1, using DAB (brown). Mean values are reported from five fields for each of twenty cases. The total number of MIB-1 positive tumor nuclei was 10 fold higher in AO vs WDO. The area occupied by vessels was also markedly increased in AO vs WDO, as was the microvessel density. Proliferating endothelial cells i.e. those with MIB-1 positive nuclei in CD34 positive cells were significantly increased (4.6 vs 0.26 positive nuclei per unit tumor area, P</=0.001) in AO. While in most areas these changes were evident as typical microvascular proliferation, other areas showed thin walled vessels with increased MIB-1 positivity. VEGF was only assessed morphologically and showed positive staining of vasculature only, in WDO, while AO also showed immunoreactivity of vessels and multiple areas of tumor cells. These findings support a contributory role for vascular proliferation in assessing histologic grade. These findings also suggest that VEGF expression which is confined to blood vessels in lower grade tumors but eventually is expressed by tumor cells in higher grade oligodendrogliomas may be an important factor as the tumor progresses.",Vessel morphometric parameters-correlation with histologic grade and VEGF expression in oligodendroglioma.
"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a replication-deficient parvovirus that is extensively used as a gene therapy vector. CD8(+) T-cell responses against the AAV capsid protein can, however, affect therapeutic efficacy. Little is known about the in vivo mechanism that leads to the crosspriming of CD8(+) T cells against the input viral capsid antigen. In this study, we report that the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-MyD88 pattern-recognition receptor pathway is uniquely capable of initiating this response. By contrast, the absence of TLR2, STING, or the addition of TLR4 agonist has no effect. Surprisingly, both conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are required for the crosspriming of capsid-specific CD8(+) T cells, whereas other antigen-presenting cells are not involved. TLR9 signaling is specifically essential in pDCs but not in cDCs, indicating that sensing of the viral genome by pDCs activates cDCs in trans to cross-present capsid antigen during CD8(+) T-cell activation. Cross-presentation and crosspriming depend not only on TLR9, but also on interferon type I signaling, and both mechanisms can be inhibited by administering specific molecules to prevent induction of capsid-specific CD8(+) T cells. Thus, these outcomes directly point to therapeutic interventions and demonstrate that innate immune blockade can eliminate unwanted immune responses in gene therapy.",Plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells cooperate in crosspriming AAV capsid-specific CD8(+) T cells.

As obesity is a known risk factor for breast cancer, plastic surgeons are increasingly challenged to reconstruct the breasts of massive weight loss patients after oncologic resection. The goal of this study is to assess the outcomes of autologous breast reconstruction in postbariatric surgery patients at a single institution. METHODS: Patients who underwent autologous breast reconstruction between 2008 and 2014 were identified. Those with a history of bariatric surgery were compared to those without a history of bariatric surgery. Analysis included age, ethnicity, BMI, comorbidities, flap type, operative complications, and reoperation rates. Propensity matched analysis was also conducted to control for preoperative differences between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Fourteen women underwent breast reconstruction following bariatric surgery, compared to 1,012 controls. Outcomes analysis revealed significant differences in breast revisions (1.35 vs. 0.61, P = .0055), implant placements (0.42 vs. 0.08, P = .0003), and total OR visits (2.78 vs. 1.67, P = .0007). There was no significant difference noted in delayed healing of the breast (57.4% vs. 33.7%, P = .087) or donor site (14.3% vs. 15.8%, P = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: As the rise in bariatric surgery mirrors that of obesity, an increasing amount of massive weight loss patients undergo treatment for breast cancer. We demonstrate profound differences in this patient population, particularly in regards to revision rates, which affects operative planning, patient counseling, and satisfaction.",Autologous breast reconstruction in the postbariatric patient population.
"Morbidity and mortality have decreased in patients with neuromuscular disease due to implementation of therapies to augment cough and improve ventilation. Infants with progressive neuromuscular disease will eventually develop respiratory complications as a result of muscle weakness and their inability to compensate during periods of increased respiratory loads. The finding of nocturnal hypercapnia is often the trigger for initiating non-invasive ventilation and studies have shown that its use not only may improve sleep-disordered breathing, but also that it may have an effect on daytime function, symptoms related to hypercapnia, and partial pressure of CO2. It is important to understand the respiratory physiology of this population and to understand the benefits and limitations of assisted ventilation.",Neuromuscular disorders and chronic ventilation.
"Rac1, a Rho GTPase family member, is dysregulated in a variety of tumor types including gastric adenocarcinoma, but little is known about its role in cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). Therefore, Rac1 activity and inhibition were examined in gastric adenocarcinoma cells and mouse xenograft models for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CSC phenotypes. Rac1 activity was significantly higher in spheroid-forming or CD44(+) gastric adenocarcinoma CSCs compared with unselected cells. Rac1 inhibition using Rac1 shRNA or a Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766) decreased expression of the self-renewal transcription factor, Sox-2, decreased spheroid formation by 78%-81%, and prevented tumor initiation in immunodeficient mice. Gastric adenocarcinoma CSCs had increased expression of the EMT transcription factor Slug, 4.4- to 8.3-fold greater migration, and 4.2- to 12.6-fold greater invasion than unselected cells, and these increases could be blocked completely with Rac1 inhibition. Gastric adenocarcinoma spheroid cells were resistant to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin chemotherapy, and this chemotherapy resistance could be reversed with Rac1 shRNA or NSC23766. The PI3K/Akt pathway may be upstream of Rac1, and JNK may be downstream of Rac1. In the MKN-45 xenograft model, cisplatin inhibited tumor growth by 50%, Rac1 inhibition by 35%, and the combination by 77%. Higher Rac1 activity, in clinical specimens from gastric adenocarcinoma patients who underwent potentially curative surgery, correlated with significantly worse survival (P = 0.017). In conclusion, Rac1 promotes the EMT program in gastric adenocarcinoma and the acquisition of a CSC state. Rac1 inhibition in gastric adenocarcinoma cells blocks EMT and CSC phenotypes, and thus may prevent metastasis and augment chemotherapy.Implications: In gastric adenocarcinoma, therapeutic targeting of the Rac1 pathway may prevent or reverse EMT and CSC phenotypes that drive tumor progression, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance.

"Synaptic loss is the structural basis for memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the underlying pathological mechanism remains elusive, it is known that misfolded proteins accumulate as beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and hyperphosphorylated Tau tangles decades before the onset of clinical disease. The loss of Pin1 facilitates the formation of these misfolded proteins in AD. Pin1 protein controls cell-cycle progression and determines the fate of proteins by the ubiquitin proteasome system. The activity of the ubiquitin proteasome system directly affects the functional and structural plasticity of the synapse. We localized Pin1 to dendritic rafts and postsynaptic density (PSD) and found the pathological loss of Pin1 within the synapses of AD brain cortical tissues. The loss of Pin1 activity may alter the ubiquitin-regulated modification of PSD proteins and decrease levels of Shank protein, resulting in aberrant synaptic structure. The loss of Pin1 activity, induced by oxidative stress, may also render neurons more susceptible to the toxicity of oligomers of Abeta and to excitation, thereby inhibiting NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity and exacerbating NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic degeneration. These results suggest that loss of Pin1 activity could lead to the loss of synaptic plasticity in the development of AD.",Pathological Role of Peptidyl-Prolyl Isomerase Pin1 in the Disruption of Synaptic Plasticity in Alzheimer's Disease.
"PURPOSE: We examined the frequency of adolescents' and their parents' mobile phone use while driving (MPUWD) in the context of their peer and parent-child interlocutors (i.e., communication partners), considering individual differences in perceived risk and symptoms of technology addiction. METHODS: Ninety-four participants (47 parent-adolescent dyads) completed a survey battery measuring their symptoms of technology addiction, perceived risk of MPUWD, and MPUWD with family members and with their peers as assessed via the proportion of trips when drivers used a mobile phone to communicate. RESULTS: For both adolescents and their parents across both types of interlocutors (parent-child, peer), stronger risk perceptions were associated with less MPUWD, and stronger symptoms of technology addiction were associated with more MPUWD. A three-way interaction among technology addiction, interlocutor (parent-child, peer), and driver (parent, adolescent) was observed. For adolescents, the association between technology addiction and MPUWD was significantly stronger for MPUWD with their peers than it was for their MPUWD with their parents; this association was not observed for parents. Parents engaged in MPUWD with their children as frequently as adolescents engaged in MPUWD with their peers. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of technology addiction play a stronger role for adolescents' MPUWD with their peers than it does for adolescents' MPUWD with their parents. These and other driver-by-interlocutor interactions should be considered in future research on distracted driving and in prevention efforts.",Adolescent and adult drivers' mobile phone use while driving with different interlocutors.
"Cells depend on the lysosome for sequestration and degradation of macromolecules in order to maintain metabolic homeostasis. These membrane-enclosed organelles can receive intracellular and extracellular cargo through endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy. Lysosomes establish acidic environments to activate enzymes that are able to break down biomolecules engulfed through these various pathways. Recent advances in methods to study the lysosome have allowed the discovery of extended roles for the lysosome in various diseases, including cancer, making it an attractive and targetable node for therapeutic intervention. This review focuses on key aspects of lysosomal biology in the context of cancer and how these properties can be exploited for the development of new therapeutic strategies. This will provide a contextual framework for how advances in methodology could be applied in future translational research.",Lysosomal Biology in Cancer.
"Thioridazine (TDZ), originally an anti-psychotic drug, suppresses several types of cancer and has specificity for leukemia stem cells. The present study was performed to assess its effect on lung cancer stem-like cells, as its effect remains unknown. TDZ was utilized to treat lung cancer stem-like cells (A549 sphere cells) and its cytotoxic effect and mechanism were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. TDZ elicited cytotoxicity in A549 sphere cells and inhibited their proliferation in a dose-dependent pattern. A549 sphere cells treated with TDZ showed nuclear fragmentation, increased G0/G1 phase distribution, positive Annexin V staining, and a change in the expression of caspase family and cell cycle-associated proteins. These results suggest the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. In addition, TDZ treatment resulted in significant inhibitory effect on mice xenografts established by A549 sphere cells. TDZ repressed growth of lung cancer stem-like cells in vitro and in vivo, indicating its potential application in targeting lung cancer stem-like cells.",Thioridazine has potent antitumor effects on lung cancer stem-like cells.
"BACKGROUND: Bitter taste receptors (T2R) have recently been demonstrated to contribute to sinonasal innate immunity. One T2R, T2R38, regulates mucosal defense against gram-negative organisms through nitric oxide (NO) production, which enhances mucociliary clearance and directly kills bacteria. To determine whether additional T2Rs contribute to this innate defense, we evaluated two other sinonasal T2Rs (T2R4 and T2R16) for regulation of NO production and expression within the human sinonasal cavity. METHODS: Primary human sinonasal cultures were stimulated with ligands specific to T2R4 and T2R16, colchicine and D-salicin, respectively. Cellular NO production was measured by intracellular 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence. For T2R expression mapping, sinonasal tissue was obtained from patients who underwent sinus surgery of the middle turbinate, maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus, or sphenoid sinus. The expression of T2R4, T2R16, and T2R38 was evaluated by using immunofluorescence with validated antibodies. RESULTS: Similar to T2R38, T2R4 and T2R16 trigger NO production in a dose-dependent manner by using the canonical taste signaling pathway in response to stimulation with their respective ligands. All three receptors were expressed in the cilia of human epithelial cells of all regions in the sinonasal cavity. CONCLUSION: These three T2Rs signaled through the same NO-mediated antimicrobial pathway and were ubiquitously expressed in the sinonasal epithelium. Additional T2Rs besides T2R38 may play a role in sinonasal immune defense. Mapping of T2R expression demonstrated the potential widespread role of T2Rs in sinonasal defense, whereas the genetics of these T2Rs may contribute to our understanding of specific endotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis and develop into novel therapeutic targets.",Nitric oxide production is stimulated by bitter taste receptors ubiquitously expressed in the sinonasal cavity.
"BACKGROUND: The CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine ligand/receptor axis controls (progenitor) cell homeostasis and trafficking. So far, an atheroprotective role of CXCL12/CXCR4 has only been implied through pharmacological intervention, in particular, because the somatic deletion of the CXCR4 gene in mice is embryonically lethal. Moreover, cell-specific effects of CXCR4 in the arterial wall and underlying mechanisms remain elusive, prompting us to investigate the relevance of CXCR4 in vascular cell types for atheroprotection. METHODS: We examined the role of vascular CXCR4 in atherosclerosis and plaque composition by inducing an endothelial cell (BmxCreER(T2)-driven)-specific or smooth muscle cell (SMC, SmmhcCreER(T2)- or TaglnCre-driven)-specific deficiency of CXCR4 in an apolipoprotein E-deficient mouse model. To identify underlying mechanisms for effects of CXCR4, we studied endothelial permeability, intravital leukocyte adhesion, involvement of the Akt/WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway and relevant phosphatases in VE-cadherin expression and function, vascular tone in aortic rings, cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and expression of SMC phenotypic markers. Finally, we analyzed associations of common genetic variants at the CXCR4 locus with the risk for coronary heart disease, along with CXCR4 transcript expression in human atherosclerotic plaques. RESULTS: The cell-specific deletion of CXCR4 in arterial endothelial cells (n=12-15) or SMCs (n=13-24) markedly increased atherosclerotic lesion formation in hyperlipidemic mice. Endothelial barrier function was promoted by CXCL12/CXCR4, which triggered Akt/WNT/beta-catenin signaling to drive VE-cadherin expression and stabilized junctional VE-cadherin complexes through associated phosphatases. Conversely, endothelial CXCR4 deficiency caused arterial leakage and inflammatory leukocyte recruitment during atherogenesis. In arterial SMCs, CXCR4 sustained normal vascular reactivity and contractile responses, whereas CXCR4 deficiency favored a synthetic phenotype, the occurrence of macrophage-like SMCs in the lesions, and impaired cholesterol efflux. Regression analyses in humans (n=259 796) identified the C-allele at rs2322864 within the CXCR4 locus to be associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease. In line, C/C risk genotype carriers showed reduced CXCR4 expression in carotid artery plaques (n=188), which was furthermore associated with symptomatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our data clearly establish that vascular CXCR4 limits atherosclerosis by maintaining arterial integrity, preserving endothelial barrier function, and a normal contractile SMC phenotype. Enhancing these beneficial functions of arterial CXCR4 by selective modulators might open novel therapeutic options in atherosclerosis.",Vascular CXCR4 Limits Atherosclerosis by Maintaining Arterial Integrity: Evidence From Mouse and Human Studies.
"Telomere length (TL) decreases with cellular ageing and biological stressors. As advanced donor and recipient ages are risk factors for chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), we hypothesised that decreased age-adjusted donor TL would predict earlier onset of CLAD. Shorter donor TL was associated with increased risk of CLAD or death (HR 1.26 per 1 kb TL decrease, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.54), particularly for young donors. Recipient TL was associated with cytopenias but not CLAD. Shorter TL was also seen in airway epithelium for subjects progressing to CLAD (p=0.02). Allograft TL may contribute to CLAD pathogenesis and facilitate risk stratification.",Short lung transplant donor telomere length is associated with decreased CLAD-free survival.
"The public health impact of evidence-based, preventive parenting interventions has been severely constrained by low rates of participation when interventions are delivered under natural conditions. It is critical that prevention scientists develop effective and feasible parent engagement methods. This study tested video-based methods for engaging parents into an evidence-based program for divorcing parents. Three alternative versions of a video were created to test the incremental effectiveness of different theory-based engagement strategies based on social influence and health behavior models. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the three experimental videos versus two control conditions, an information-only brochure and an information-only video. Participants were attendees at brief, court-mandated parent information programs (PIPs) for divorcing or never married, litigating parents. Of the 1123 eligible parents, 61% were female and 13% were never married to the child's other parent. Randomization to one of five conditions was conducted at the PIP class level, blocking on facilitator. All participants completed a 15-item, empirically validated risk index and an invitation form. Results of regression analyses indicated that the most streamlined version, the core principles video, significantly increased parents' interest in participating in the parenting intervention, enrollment during a follow-up call, and initiation (i.e., attending at least one session) compared to one or the other control conditions. Findings suggest that videos based on social influence and health behavior theories could provide an effective and feasible method for increasing parent engagement, which would help maximize the public health benefits of evidence-based parenting interventions.",Video-Based Approach to Engaging Parents into a Preventive Parenting Intervention for Divorcing Families: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.
"BACKGROUND: Our goal is to correlate the findings on flexion and extension radiographs with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the clinical history, in a nonrandomly selected cohort of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q). METHODS: All patients with the 22q who had a dynamic MRI from January 2004 to March 2015 were included. We analyzed multiple radiographic measurements on both the dynamic plain films and the MRIs, and correlated these findings with a review of each patient's medical record. RESULTS: Multiple congenital anomalies were identified as noted in previous studies, and 61% of the patients had a failure of fusion of the anterior (n=2, 9%), posterior (n=2, 9%), or anterior and posterior arches (n=10, 43%). Quantitative measurements were impossible to report with certainty because of the upper cervical anomalies, and no cases of instability were identified using a qualitative assessment. We identified spinal cord encroachment (30%) and impingement (18%); however, none of the patients had any signal change in their spinal cord. None of these findings could be definitively correlated with any clinical symptoms. A single patient was diagnosed with a Chiari I malformation, while another had cerebellar ectopia. CONCLUSIONS: Although the upper cervical anomalies are extremely common in 22q, we did not identify cases of instability on dynamic plain radiographs and MRI. Although our findings do not support routine screening with flexion and extension MRI, this study may be required in patients with neurological symptoms and/or findings or abnormalities on dynamic plain radiographs.

"OBJECTIVES: Most adolescent cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are diagnosed in the emergency department (ED). An important step to prevent PID-related morbidity among this high-risk population is to quantify prevalence and microbial patterns and identify testing and treatment gaps. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study of all visits by adolescents to an urban children's ED with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis of PID in 2012. We used standard descriptive statistics to quantify PID diagnoses, sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing, and treatment. RESULTS: Pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed in more than 9% of women with a chief complaint of abdominal/pelvic pain. Most diagnosed cases underwent some STI testing, and 40% tested positive. Seventy percent of cases received antibiotics recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of PID among adolescents in the pediatric ED. Rates of STI testing and appropriate treatment reveal gaps in diagnosis and management, representing a lost opportunity for identification and treatment of PID/STIs among high-risk adolescents.",Pelvic Inflammatory Disease in a Pediatric Emergency Department: Epidemiology and Treatment.
"The purpose of this study was to commission and clinically test a robotic stereotactic delivery system (CyberKnife, Sunnyvale, CA) to treat early-stage glottic laryngeal cancer. We enrolled 15 patients with cTis-T2N0M0 carcinoma of the glottic larynx onto an institutional review board (IRB)-approved clinical trial. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) plans prescribed 45 Gy/10 fractions to the involved hemilarynx. SBRT dosimetry was compared with (1) standard carotid-sparing laryngeal intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and (2) selective hemilaryngeal IMRT. Our results demonstrate that SBRT plans improved sparing of the contralateral arytenoid (mean 20.0 Gy reduction, p <0.001), ipsilateral carotid Dmax (mean 20.6 Gy reduction, p <0.001), contralateral carotid Dmax (mean 28.1 Gy reduction, p <0.001), and thyroid Dmean (mean 15.0 Gy reduction, p <0.001) relative to carotid-sparing IMRT. SBRT also modestly improved dose sparing to the contralateral arytenoid (mean 4.8 Gy reduction, p = 0.13) and spinal cord Dmax (mean 4.9 Gy reduction, p = 0.015) relative to selective hemilaryngeal IMRT plans. This ""phantom-to-clinic"" feasibility study confirmed that hypofractionated SBRT treatment for early-stage laryngeal cancer can potentially spare dose to adjacent normal tissues relative to current IMRT standards.

"Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a common inherited connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility. The natural history of aortic root dilation (AoD), a potential complication of EDS, has not been well characterized in this population. We describe the natural history of aortic root size in a large cohort of patients with hEDS. A cohort of 325 patients with HEDS was identified at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), including 163 patients from a previous study. Medical records were reviewed and each participant's height, weight, and aortic dimensions from up to four echocardiograms were documented. Aortic root z-scores were calculated using two established formulas based on age (Boston or Devereux). Overall prevalence of AoD and prevalence by age were calculated and longitudinal regression was performed. The prevalence of AoD with a z-score >/= 2.0 was 14.2% (46/325) and with a z-score of >/=3.0 was 5.5% (18/325). No significant increases in z-score were seen over time for patients with multiple echocardiograms. Participants under the age of 15 years had an average decline of 0.1 standard deviations (SDs)/year. No significant change was found after 15 of age. Between the ages of 15 and 21 years, Boston z-scores were 0.96 higher than Devereux z-scores. The nearly 1 z-score unit difference between formulas indicates caution prior to diagnosing AoD in patients with hEDS. In light of the low prevalence and lack of progression of AoD, routine echocardiograms may not be warranted for pediatric patients with hEDS.",Natural history of aortic root dilation through young adulthood in a hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome cohort.
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a promising cancer treatment that has recently been undergoing rapid development. However, there are still some major challenges, including precise tumor targeting to avoid off-target or ""on-target/off-tumor"" toxicity, adequate T cell infiltration and migration to solid tumors and T cell proliferation and persistence across the physical and biochemical barriers of solid tumors. In this review, we focus on the primary challenges and strategies to design safe and effective CAR T cells, including using novel cutting-edge technologies for CAR and vector designs to increase both the safety and efficacy, further T cell modification to overcome the tumor-associated immune suppression, and using gene editing technologies to generate universal CAR T cells. All these efforts promote the development and evolution of CAR T cell therapy and move toward our ultimate goal-curing cancer with high safety, high efficacy, and low cost.",Increasing the safety and efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy.
"Objective: To test the performance of the 2015 ACR-EULAR gout classification criteria against presence of SF MSU crystals in a primary healthcare population. Methods: The criteria were applied to an existing dataset of consecutive patients with monoarthritis presenting to Dutch family physicians; all patients underwent microscopic SF analysis by design. The data had been prospectively collected to develop a diagnostic decision rule for gout in 2010. Diagnostic performance was assessed by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and constructing calibration plots for the full version of the criteria (including SF analysis results of all patients) and the clinical-only version (not including SF analysis results). Performance of both versions was compared with the 2010 diagnostic rule. Results: Of 381 patients enrolled into the study, 216 (57%) were MSU crystal-positive. The full and clinical-only versions of the criteria had satisfactory area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.96 and 0.87, respectively), high specificity (0.98 and 0.84), high PPV (0.98 and 0.84), but lower sensitivity (0.68 and 0.68) and NPV (0.70 and 0.67). Specificity and PPV of both versions were higher compared with 0.71 and 0.89 of the 2010 diagnostic decision rule. The decison rule had the highest sensitivity and NPV (0.99 and 0.97). Conclusion: This study presents the first external validation of the 2015 ACR-EULAR gout classification criteria in a primary healthcare setting. The criteria perform well in this setting in patients presenting with monoarthritis for the purpose of enrolling into gout clinical trials.",Performance of the 2015 ACR-EULAR classification criteria for gout in a primary care population presenting with monoarthritis.
"DOT1L is a protein methyltransferase involved in the development and maintenance of MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia through its ectopic methylation of histones associated with well-characterized leukemic genes. Pinometostat (EPZ-5676), a selective inhibitor of DOT1L, is in clinical development in relapsed/refractory acute leukemia patients harboring rearrangements of the MLL gene. The observation of responses and subsequent relapses in the adult trial treating MLL-r patients motivated preclinical investigations into potential mechanisms of pinometostat treatment-emergent resistance (TER) in cell lines confirmed to have MLL-r. TER was achieved in five MLL-r cell lines, KOPN-8, MOLM-13, MV4-11, NOMO-1, and SEM. Two of the cell lines, KOPN-8 and NOMO-1, were thoroughly characterized to understand the mechanisms involved in pinometostat resistance. Unlike many other targeted therapies, resistance does not appear to be achieved through drug-induced selection of mutations of the target itself. Instead, we identified both drug efflux transporter dependent and independent mechanisms of resistance to pinometostat. In KOPN-8 TER cells, increased expression of the drug efflux transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, MDR1) was the primary mechanism of drug resistance. In contrast, resistance in NOMO-1 cells occurs through a mechanism other than upregulation of a specific efflux pump. RNA-seq analysis performed on both parental and resistant KOPN-8 and NOMO-1 cell lines supported two unique candidate pathway mechanisms that may explain the pinometostat resistance observed in these cell lines. These results are the first demonstration of TER models of the DOT1L inhibitor pinometostat and may provide useful tools for investigating clinical resistance. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(8); 1669-79.

Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is the 2nd most common chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease and associated with a high burden of illness. Morbidity arises not only from untreated xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca but also from extra-glandular manifestations including the development of non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphomas. Proper diagnosis of SS requires objective evidence of dry eyes and/or objective evidence of dry mouth as well as proof of autoimmunity. The recent development of new international classification criteria and clinical practice guidelines for SS should not only enhance the existing standards of care but also facilitate further studies to improve future diagnosis and outcomes.,Sjogren's syndrome: Clinical aspects.
"Importance: Cryolipolysis is a popular, well-tolerated nonsurgical procedure that uses controlled cooling to selectively destroy fat cells. Central submental cryolipolysis has been reported to be safe and effective, but many patients would benefit from extending this treatment over the entire submental region. Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of cryolipolysis for reduction of lateral and central submental fat. Design, Setting, and Participants: The study population consisted of 14 participants who were treated from January 22 to June 30, 2016, in the lateral and central submental area to reduce unwanted subcutaneous fat. A small-volume cup applicator was used to administer 2 cryolipolysis treatments, delivered in 45-minute treatment cycles in 2 sessions. For the first treatment session, all participants received bilateral treatments with approximately 20% overlap of the treatment area. At the 6-week follow-up visit, participants were reassessed to determine whether they would benefit from a second treatment and to determine the number of cycles needed to achieve the optimal aesthetic result, and then they were treated a second time. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participant surveys assessed tolerability and treatment satisfaction at 12 weeks following the second treatment. Clinicians monitored adverse events to assess safety. Caliper measurements were recorded to assess fat thickness reduction. Treatment efficacy was objectively evaluated using 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional imaging. Results: Among the 14 participants (12 women and 2 men; mean [SD] age, 50.5 [10.4] years), the adverse effects of the procedure were typically mild and included numbness and tingling, which resolved without intervention by the final 12-week follow-up visit. An independent review of digital photographs revealed an 81.0% (95% CI, 65.9%-91.4%; P = .02) correct identification rate (34 of 42 images) of the pretreatment and posttreatment images. Caliper measurements demonstrated a mean (SD) fat layer reduction of 2.3 (0.8) mm (range, 0.7-3.5 mm). Three-dimensional imaging revealed a mean (SD) reduction in fat volume of 4.82 (11.42) cm3 (from a reduction of 32.69 cm3 to an increase of 13.85 cm3), in skin surface area of 1.29 (1.42) cm2 (from a reduction of 3.18 cm2 to an increase of 0.99 cm2), and in fat thickness of 3.77 (3.59) mm (from of reduction of 13.10 mm to an increase of 0.47 mm). Results of participant surveys indicated that 13 participants (93%) were satisfied with the cryolipolysis treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: Although safe and efficacious central submental cryolipolysis has been reported, this is the first clinical study of cryolipolysis for treatment of the entire submental area using overlapping bilateral treatments and a shorter treatment duration. The study demonstrates that bilateral submental cryolipolysis is well tolerated and produces visible and significant fat layer reduction.

"Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic and its prevalence has been projected to grow by 40% in the next decade. This increasing prevalence has implications for the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and also for chronic kidney disease (CKD). A high body mass index is one of the strongest risk factors for new-onset CKD. In individuals affected by obesity, a compensatory hyperfiltration occurs to meet the heightened metabolic demands of the increased body weight. The increase in intraglomerular pressure can damage the kidneys and raise the risk of developing CKD in the long-term. The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy has increased ten-fold in recent years. Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis, and for a number of malignancies including kidney cancer. This year, the World Kidney Day will promote education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyle and health policy measures that make preventive behaviors an affordable option.",Obesity and kidney disease: hidden consequences of the epidemic.
"The majority of medical students complete the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 after their foundational sciences; however, there are compelling reasons to examine this practice. This article provides the perspectives of eight MD-granting medical schools that have moved Step 1 after the core clerkships, describing their rationale, logistics of the change, outcomes, and lessons learned. The primary reasons these institutions cite for moving Step 1 after clerkships are to foster more enduring and integrated basic science learning connected to clinical care and to better prepare students for the increasingly clinical focus of Step 1. Each school provides key features of the preclerkship and clinical curricula and details concerning taking Steps 1 and 2, to allow other schools contemplating change to understand the landscape. Most schools report an increase in aggregate Step 1 scores after the change. Despite early positive outcomes, there may be unintended consequences to later scheduling of Step 1, including relatively late student reevaluations of their career choice if Step 1 scores are not competitive in the specialty area of their choice. The score increases should be interpreted with caution: These schools may not be representative with regard to mean Step 1 scores and failure rates. Other aspects of curricular transformation and rising national Step 1 scores confound the data. Although the optimal timing of Step 1 has yet to be determined, this article summarizes the perspectives of eight schools that changed Step 1 timing, filling a gap in the literature on this important topic.",Why Not Wait?

"The Early Literacy Screener (ELS) is a brief screen for emergent literacy delays in 4- and 5-year-olds. Standard developmental screens may also flag these children. What is the value of adding the ELS? Parents of children aged 4 (n = 45) and 5 (n = 26) years completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3), the Survey of Well-Being in Young Children (SWYC), and the ELS. Rates of positive agreement (PA), negative agreement (NA), and overall agreement (Cohen's kappa) across the various screening tools were calculated.

"Women make up almost half of the labor force with older women becoming a growing segment of the population. Work characteristics influence physical functioning and women are at particular risk for physical limitations. However, little research has explored the effects of work characteristics on women's physical functioning. U.S. women between the ages of 50 and 79 were enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study between 1993 and 1998. Women provided job titles and years worked at their three longest-held jobs (n = 79,147). Jobs were linked to characteristics in the Occupational Information Network. Three categories of job characteristics related to substantive complexity, physical demand, and social collaboration emerged. The association between job characteristics and physical limitations in later life, measured using a SF-36 Physical Functioning score <25th percentile, was examined using modified Poisson regression. After controlling for confounding variables, high physical demand was positively associated with physical limitations (RR = 1.09 CI: 1.06-1.12) and substantively complex work was negatively associated (RR = 0.94, CI: 0.91-0.96). Jobs requiring complex problem solving, active learning, and critical thinking were associated with better physical functioning. Employers should explore opportunities to reduce strain from physically demanding jobs and incorporate substantively complex tasks into women's work to improve long-term health.",Work Characteristics Associated with Physical Functioning in Women.
"BACKGROUND: Understanding national trends in the treatment of pediatric supracondylar humeral fractures will provide important insight into variations in regional treatment and identify areas for improving value and quality in care delivery in the U.S. METHODS: U.S. national trends in the treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures were evaluated through query of the Humana (2007 to 2014) and ING (2007 to 2011) administrative claims databases. Geographic variation and changes in surgical and transfer rates over time were further explored through the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) database (2006 to 2011). Hospital characteristics impacting treatment decisions were identified. RESULTS: A total of 29,642 pediatric patients with supracondylar humeral fractures were identified in the administrative claims databases and a projected 63,348 encounters for supracondylar humeral fracture were identified in the NEDS database. The majority of the patients (76.1%; 22,563 of 29,642) were treated definitively with cast immobilization. Operative treatment was performed in 23.9% of the patients (7,079 of 29,642), with no change observed in the operative rate over time (p = 0.055). Of patients undergoing operative treatment, closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) was performed in 87.3%, with a significant increase noted in the rate of CRPP over time (p = 0.0001); open reduction was performed in 12.7%, with a significant decrease noted in the rate of open reduction over time (p < 0.0001). Regional surgical rates generally showed significant variation from 2006 to 2010, followed by a convergence in the surgical rate among all geographic regions in 2011. These trends occurred simultaneous to a significant increase in transfer rates nationwide, from 5.6% in 2006 to 9.1% in 2011 (p = 0.0011). Transfer rates were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) for nontrauma, nonteaching, and nonmetropolitan centers while surgical rates were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) for trauma, teaching, and metropolitan centers when rates were analyzed by hospital designation. CONCLUSIONS: Operative treatment was performed in 24% of pediatric patients with supracondylar humeral fractures from 2007 to 2014. There was a convergence of surgical rates across geographic regions, suggesting that a ""standard of care"" in the treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures is being established nationally. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cases of pediatric supracondylar humeral fracture are increasingly being transferred to and, when managed surgically, receiving care at metropolitan facilities designated as trauma centers or teaching hospitals, with a corresponding decrease observed in the rate of open reduction. The optimization of nationwide referral and treatment patterns may improve value in care delivery.",Emerging U.S. National Trends in the Treatment of Pediatric Supracondylar Humeral Fractures.

"Objective To determine the risks of bleeding and other complications in pediatric patients who require noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (PPV) in the immediate posttonsillectomy period. Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Single tertiary pediatric hospital. Subjects and Methods Sixty-nine patients who had undergone tonsillectomy from July 2007 through December 2013 and required postoperative PPV were reviewed. Data collected included age, sex, medical history, preoperative polysomnogram parameters, length of use and type of noninvasive ventilatory support, and postoperative complications. Bleeding rate was calculated. Results Sixty-nine children met inclusion criteria for the study. Most had comorbid conditions. The mean age of these patients was 6.4 years. The postoperative bleeding rate of children who required operative intervention for control was 5.97%. Patients did not experience other complications. Conclusion This is the largest study in the literature investigating bleeding in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy who required postoperative noninvasive PPV. Some hesitation may exist in using this form of ventilation when open pharyngeal wounds are exposed to pressure, but this study suggests that it can be used as a suitable alternative to invasive ventilation.",The Use of Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation following Pediatric Tonsillectomy.
We have recently published on the limited effectiveness of sirolimus as a treatment option for hypoglycaemia as a consequence of hyperinsulinism. Our data oppose the view that mTOR inhibitors provide new opportunities for the treatment of patients with hyperinsulinism. We are not convinced by the argument that any benefit for some patients outweighs the potential and later long-term problems that accompany mTOR inhibition in the neonate. We also express the opinion that caution must be taken when repurposing/repositioning therapies in the field of rare disease.,Extreme caution on the use of sirolimus for the congenital hyperinsulinism in infancy patient.
"Neonatal intubation is one of the most common procedures performed by neonatologists, however, the procedure is difficult and high risk. Neonates who endure the procedure often experience adverse events, including bradycardia and severe oxygen desaturations. Because of low first attempt success rates, neonates are often subjected to multiple intubation attempts before the endotracheal tube is successfully placed. These factors conspire to make intubation one of the most dangerous procedures in neonatal medicine. In this commentary we review key elements in the journey to improve neonatal intubation safety. We begin with a review of intubation success rates and complications. Then, we discuss the importance of intubation training. Next, we examine quality improvement efforts and patient safety research to improve neonatal intubation safety. Finally, we evaluate new tools which may improve success rates, and decrease complications during neonatal intubation.",Improving neonatal intubation safety: A journey of a thousand miles.

"Traditionally, maxillary hypoplasia in the setting of cleft lip and palate is treated via orthognathic surgery at skeletal maturity, which condemns these patients to abnormal facial proportions during adolescence. The authors sought to determine the safety profile of computer-aided design/computer-aided modeling (CAD/CAM) planned, Le Fort I distraction osteogenesis with internal distractors in select patients presenting at a young age with severe maxillary retrusion. The authors retrospectively reviewed our ""early"" Le Fort I distraction osteogenesis experience-patients performed for severe maxillary retrusion (>/=12 mm underjet), after canine eruption but prior to skeletal maturity-at a single institution. Patient demographics, cleft characteristics, CAD/CAM operative plans, surgical complications, postoperative imaging, and outcomes were analyzed. Four patients were reviewed, with a median age of 12.8 years at surgery (range 8.6-16.1 years). Overall mean advancement was 17.95 + 2.9 mm (range 13.7-19.9 mm) with mean SNA improved 18.4 degrees to 87.4 +/- 5.7 degrees . Similarly, ANB improved 17.7 degrees to a postoperative mean of 2.4 +/- 3.1 degrees . Mean follow-up was 100.7 weeks, with 3 of 4 patients in a Class I occlusion with moderate-term follow-up; 1 of 4 will need an additional maxillary advancement due to pseudo-relapse. In conclusion, Le Fort I distraction osteogenesis with internal distractors is a safe procedure to treat severe maxillary hypoplasia after canine eruption but before skeletal maturity. Short-term follow-up demonstrates safety of the procedure and relative stability of the advancement. Pseudo-relapse is a risk of the procedure that must be discussed at length with patients and families.","Early, Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Modeling Planned, Le Fort I Advancement With Internal Distractors to Treat Severe Maxillary Hypoplasia in Cleft Lip and Palate."

"BACKGROUND: Nearly half of child pneumonia deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Microbial communities in the nasopharynx are a reservoir for pneumonia pathogens and remain poorly described in African children. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from children with pneumonia (N = 204), children with upper respiratory infection symptoms (N = 55) and healthy children (N = 60) in Botswana between April 2012 and April 2014. We sequenced the V3 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene and used partitioning around medoids to cluster samples into microbiota biotypes. We then used multivariable logistic regression to examine whether microbiota biotypes were associated with pneumonia and upper respiratory infection symptoms. RESULTS: Mean ages of children with pneumonia, children with upper respiratory infection symptoms and healthy children were 8.2, 11.4 and 8.0 months, respectively. Clustering of nasopharyngeal microbiota identified 5 distinct biotypes: Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum-dominant (23%), Haemophilus-dominant (11%), Moraxella-dominant (24%), Staphylococcus-dominant (13%) and Streptococcus-dominant (28%). The Haemophilus-dominant [odds ratio (OR): 13.55; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.10-87.26], the Staphylococcus-dominant (OR: 8.27; 95% CI: 2.13-32.14) and the Streptococcus-dominant (OR: 39.97; 95% CI: 6.63-241.00) biotypes were associated with pneumonia. The Moraxella-dominant (OR: 3.71; 95% CI: 1.09-12.64) and Streptococcus-dominant (OR: 12.26; 95% CI: 1.81-83.06) biotypes were associated with upper respiratory infection symptoms. In children with pneumonia, HIV infection was associated with a lower relative abundance of Dolosigranulum (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia and upper respiratory infection symptoms are associated with distinct nasopharyngeal microbiota biotypes in African children. A lower abundance of the commensal genus Dolosigranulum may contribute to the higher pneumonia risk of HIV-infected children.",The Nasopharyngeal Microbiota of Children With Respiratory Infections in Botswana.
"Pain behaviors are important indicators of functioning in chronic pain; however, no self-reported pain behavior instrument has been developed for pediatric populations. The purpose of this study was to create a brief pediatric measure of patient-reported pain behaviors as part of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS). A pool of 47 candidate items for this measure had been previously developed through qualitative research. In this study, youth with chronic pain associated with juvenile fibromyalgia, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or sickle cell disease (ages 8-18 years) from 3 pediatric centers completed all 47 candidate items for development of the pain behavior item bank along with established measures of pain interference, depressive symptoms, fatigue, average pain intensity, and pain catastrophizing. Caregivers reported on sociodemographic information and health history. Psychometric properties of the pain behavior items were examined using an item response theory framework with confirmatory factor analysis and examination of differential item functioning, internal consistency, and test information curves. Results were used along with expert consensus and alignment with the adult PROMIS pain behavior items to arrive at an 8-item pediatric pain behavior short form, and all 47 items were retained in a calibrated item bank. Confirmatory factor analysis and correlations with validated measures of pain, pain interference, and psychosocial functioning provided support for the short form's reliability and validity. The new PROMIS pediatric pain behavior scale provides a reliable, precise, and valid measure for future research on pain behavior in school-aged children with chronic pain.",Development and validation of the self-reported PROMIS pediatric pain behavior item bank and short form scale.
"New skill sets and improvement disciplines are constantly arising across the vast industrial and academic landscape of modern economies. Prescient hospital administrators are routinely searching for new and innovative ways to improve care, care delivery, safety, quality, and access. But, it can be challenging to identify those emerging skill sets, which will likely have lasting effect and will provide strong return on investment, from passing fads with little capacity to move performance benchmarks for a hospital. Here, we present a rubric for investigating new skill sets, using The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's investigation into human factors engineering as a case study, and determining whether they can support hospital operations and improvements while providing sufficient return to justify the expense and challenge of incorporating ideas and methods into a quality and performance improvement environment.",Evaluating New Skill Sets for Performance Improvement: Human Factors as a Case Study.
"BACKGROUND: Exaggerated thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) production and infiltration of basophils are associated with the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD), a recognized risk factor for the development of food allergies. Although TSLP and basophils have been implicated in promotion of food-induced allergic disorders in response to epicutaneous sensitization, the mechanisms by which TSLP-elicited basophils guide the progression of allergic inflammation in the skin to distant mucosal sites, such as the gastrointestinal tract, are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We sought to test the role of basophil-intrinsic IL-4 production in TH2 sensitization to food antigens in the skin and effector food-induced allergic responses in the gut. METHODS: Mice were epicutaneously sensitized with ovalbumin on an AD-like skin lesion, followed by intragastric antigen challenge to induce IgE-mediated food allergy. The requirement for basophil-derived IL-4 production for TH2 polarization and the pathogenesis of IgE-mediated food allergy was assessed in vitro by using coculture experiments with naive T cells and in vivo by using Il4 3'UTR mice that selectively lack IL-4 production in basophils. RESULTS: Epicutaneous food antigen sensitization is associated with infiltration of IL-4-competent innate immune cells to the skin, with basophils and eosinophils representing the predominant populations. In contrast to basophils, absence of eosinophils did not alter disease outcome. Coculture of IL-4-competent basophils together with dendritic cells and naive T cells was sufficient to promote TH2 polarization in an IL-4-dependent manner in vitro, whereas absence of basophil-intrinsic IL-4 production in vivo was associated with reduced food-induced allergic responses. CONCLUSION: TSLP-elicited basophils promote epicutaneous sensitization to food antigens and subsequent IgE-mediated food allergy through IL-4. Strategies to target the TSLP-basophil-IL-4 axis in patients with AD might lead to innovative therapies that can prevent the progression of allergies to distant mucosal sites.",Basophil-derived IL-4 promotes epicutaneous antigen sensitization concomitant with the development of food allergy.
"Annotating unstructured texts in Electronic Health Records data is usually a necessary step for conducting machine learning research on such datasets. Manual annotation by domain experts provides data of the best quality, but has become increasingly impractical given the rapid increase in the volume of EHR data. In this article, we examine the effectiveness of crowdsourcing with unscreened online workers as an alternative for transforming unstructured texts in EHRs into annotated data that are directly usable in supervised learning models. We find the crowdsourced annotation data to be just as effective as expert data in training a sentence classification model to detect the mentioning of abnormal ear anatomy in radiology reports of audiology. Furthermore, we have discovered that enabling workers to self-report a confidence level associated with each annotation can help researchers pinpoint less-accurate annotations requiring expert scrutiny. Our findings suggest that even crowd workers without specific domain knowledge can contribute effectively to the task of annotating unstructured EHR datasets.",Crowd control: Effectively utilizing unscreened crowd workers for biomedical data annotation.

"BACKGROUND: Ureteral herniations are a rare occurrence, generally found incidentally on cross sectional imaging or during surgical intervention for unrelated processes. Several locations of ureteral herniations can occur including the inguinal, femoral, sciatic, obturator, and thoracic regions. While few reports of ureteral hernias are reported in the literature overall, the vast majority of those reported are inguinoscrotal herniations found during evaluation and treatment of inguinal hernias. Pelvic outlet ureteral herniations intrinsically are more common secondary to their dependent locations. Intrathoracic ureteral herniations through diaphragmatic defects are an exceptionally rare subset of ureteral herniations and have only been described sparingly. Fewer than ten case reports of diaphramatic ureteral herniations have been reported and none have described both cystoscopic management and open reconstruction. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 81 year old female with flank pain who was found to have idiopathic diaphragmatic hernia with incarcerated proximal ureter. She had no prior injury or surgery that explained her clinical presentation. She was initially observed and then managed conservatively with ureteral stent exchanges. Ultimately she underwent open surgical repair of her diaphragmatic hernia, reduction, resection and anastomosis of redundant proximal incarcerated ureteral segment, and nephropexy for a hypermobile right renal unit. This case report illustrates the pre- and post-operative imaging studies of a very rare intrathoracic ureteral herniation as well as surgical approach to repair. CONCLUSION: A herniated ureter is a potential source of serious renal and ureteral complications. The thoracic herniation of ureter is the rarest of the ureteral herniations. When discovered, they should be managed to preserve renal function and prevent strangulation of the affected segment of ureter. This case report documents the treatment of a thoracic ureteral herniation with observation, conservative endoscopic management, and finally open surgical reconstruction.",A rare diaphragmatic ureteral herniation case report: endoscopic and open reconstructive management.
"OBJECTIVE: Explore the efficacy of extended-release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) for preventing relapse to amphetamine use. METHOD: Clinical trial of 100 amphetamine-dependent, treatment-seeking patients who were randomized to 6 monthly 380 mg doses of XR-NTX or matching placebo before entering intensive outpatient after varying lengths of inpatient treatment in Reykjavik, Iceland. Weekly urine drug tests, retention, and standardized instruments assessed efficacy. RESULTS: Of 169 approached, 100 were randomized. Although amphetamine dependence was the main reason for seeking treatment, three-quarters or more of participants had 1 or more other substance dependencies. Of 51 randomized to XR-NTX, 20 received 4 or more injections; of 49 assigned to placebo, 26 received 4 or more injections. Of the planned 2400 weekly urine drug tests, 1247 were collected (52%); 4% of these were positive for amphetamine, 8% for benzodiazepine, 7% for marijuana, 1% for cocaine, and 1% for opioid. XR-NTX had no effect on amphetamine-positive tests, retention, or other outcomes. Those providing half or more of their tests attended more weeks of treatment than those providing less than half of their tests (m = 10.76 vs 3.31; t (92) = 5.91, P < 0.0001), and 92 participants provided at least 1 test. CONCLUSIONS: Adding XR-NTX to the usual combination of inpatient and intensive outpatient treatment did not reduce amphetamine use. The low prevalence of substance use among collected urine samples, and the association between collected samples and weeks in treatment, was consistent with other studies showing that staying in treatment is associated with better outcomes.",Extended-Release Injectable Naltrexone (XR-NTX) With Intensive Psychosocial Therapy for Amphetamine-Dependent Persons Seeking Treatment: A Placebo-Controlled Trial.
"In recent years, the number of approved and investigational agents that can be safely administered for the treatment of lymphoma patients for a prolonged period of time has substantially increased. Many of these novel agents are evaluated in early-phase clinical trials in patients with a wide range of malignancies, including solid tumors and lymphoma. Furthermore, with the advances in genome sequencing, new ""basket"" clinical trial designs have emerged that select patients based on the presence of specific genetic alterations across different types of solid tumors and lymphoma. The standard response criteria currently in use for lymphoma are the Lugano Criteria which are based on [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography or bidimensional tumor measurements on computerized tomography scans. These differ from the RECIST criteria used in solid tumors, which use unidimensional measurements. The RECIL group hypothesized that single-dimension measurement could be used to assess response to therapy in lymphoma patients, producing results similar to the standard criteria. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing 47 828 imaging measurements from 2983 individual adult and pediatric lymphoma patients enrolled on 10 multicenter clinical trials and developed new lymphoma response criteria (RECIL 2017). We demonstrate that assessment of tumor burden in lymphoma clinical trials can use the sum of longest diameters of a maximum of three target lesions. Furthermore, we introduced a new provisional category of a minor response. We also clarified response assessment in patients receiving novel immune therapy and targeted agents that generate unique imaging situations.",International Working Group consensus response evaluation criteria in lymphoma (RECIL 2017).
"Immunotherapies have achieved remarkable success in treating different forms of cancer including melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, bladder cancer, synovial cell sarcoma, and multiple myeloma using immune checkpoint blockade or gene-engineered T-cells. Although gynecologic cancers have not been historically classified as immunogenic tumors, growing evidence has shown that they are in fact able to elicit endogenous antitumor immune responses suggesting that patients with these cancers may benefit from immunotherapy. Modest clinical success has been accomplished in early trials using immunotherapeutic modalities for major gynecologic cancers including ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancer. Unlike solid cancers with high mutational burdens, or hematologic malignancies where target antigens are expressed homogenously and exclusively by tumor cells, identifying tumor-restricted antigens has been challenging when designing a T-cell targeted therapy for gynecologic tumors. Nevertheless, mounting preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that targeting shared, viral or patient-specific mutated antigens expressed by gynecologic tumors with T-cells may improve patient outcome. Here we review the strengths and weaknesses of targeting these various antigens, as well as provide insight into the future of immunotherapy for gynecologic cancers.",T-cell target antigens across major gynecologic cancers.
"BACKGROUND: Approximately one-third of reduced pediatric distal radius fractures redisplace, resulting in further treatment. Two major modifiable risk factors for loss of reduction are reduction adequacy and cast quality. Closed reduction and immobilization of distal radius fractures is an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education residency milestone. Teaching and assessing competency could be improved with a life-like simulation training tool. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Our goal was to develop and validate a realistic distal radius fracture reduction and casting simulator as determined by (1) a questionnaire regarding the ""realism"" of the model and (2) the quantitative assessments of reduction time, residual angulation, and displacement. METHODS: A distal radius fracture model was created with radiopaque bony segments and articulating elbows and shoulders. Simulated periosteum and internal deforming forces required proper reduction and casting techniques to achieve and maintain reduction. The forces required were estimated through an iterative process through feedback from experienced clinicians. Embedded monofilaments allowed for quantitative assessment of residual displacement and angulation through the use of fluoroscopy. Subjects were asked to perform closed reduction and apply a long arm fiberglass cast. Primary performance variables assessed included reduction time, residual angulation, and displacement. Secondary performance variables consisted of number of fluoroscopic images, casting time, and cast index (defined as the ratio of the internal width of the forearm cast in the sagittal plane to the internal width in the coronal plane at the fracture site). Subject grading was performed by two blinded reviewers. Interrater reliability was nearly perfect across all measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.94-0.99), thus disagreements in measurements were handled by averaging the assessed values. After completion the participants answered a Likert-based questionnaire regarding the realism of simulation. Eighteen participants consented to participate in the study (eight attending pediatric orthopaedic surgeons, six junior residents, four senior residents). The performances of junior residents (Postgraduate Year [PGY] 1-2), senior residents (PGY 3-5), and attending surgeons were compared using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's-adjusted pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: The majority of participants (15 of 18) felt that the model looked, felt, and moved like a human forearm. All participants strongly agreed that the model taught the basic steps of fracture reduction and should be implemented in orthopaedic training. Attending surgeons reduced fractures in less time than junior residents (60 +/- 27 seconds versus 460 +/- 62 seconds; mean difference, 400 seconds; 95% CI, 335-465 seconds; p < 0.001). Residual angulation was greater for junior residents when compared with attending surgeons on AP (7 degrees +/- 5 degrees versus 0.7 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees ; mean difference, 6.3 degrees ; 95% CI, 3 degrees -11 degrees ; p = 0.003) and lateral (27 degrees +/- 7 degrees versus 7 degrees +/- 5 degrees ; mean difference, 20 degrees ; 95% CI, 13 degrees -27 degrees ; p = 0.001) radiographs. Similarly, residual displacement was greater for junior residents than either senior residents (mean difference, 16 mm; 95% CI, 2-34 mm; p = 0.05) or attending surgeons (mean difference, 15 mm; 95% CI, 3-27 mm; p = 0.02) on lateral images. There were no differences identified in secondary performance variables (number of fluoroscopic images, casting time, and cast index) between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first distal radius fracture reduction model to incorporate an elbow and shoulder and allow quantitative assessment of the fracture reduction. This simulator may be useful in an orthopaedic resident training program to help them reach a defined minimum level of competency. This simulator also could easily be integrated in other accreditation and training programs, including emergency medicine.

"The hypothesis that the S allele of the 5-HTTLPR serotonin transporter promoter region is associated with increased risk of depression, but only in individuals exposed to stressful situations, has generated much interest, research and controversy since first proposed in 2003. Multiple meta-analyses combining results from heterogeneous analyses have not settled the issue. To determine the magnitude of the interaction and the conditions under which it might be observed, we performed new analyses on 31 data sets containing 38 802 European ancestry subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and assessed for depression and childhood maltreatment or other stressful life events, and meta-analysed the results. Analyses targeted two stressors (narrow, broad) and two depression outcomes (current, lifetime). All groups that published on this topic prior to the initiation of our study and met the assessment and sample size criteria were invited to participate. Additional groups, identified by consortium members or self-identified in response to our protocol (published prior to the start of analysis) with qualifying unpublished data, were also invited to participate. A uniform data analysis script implementing the protocol was executed by each of the consortium members. Our findings do not support the interaction hypothesis. We found no subgroups or variable definitions for which an interaction between stress and 5-HTTLPR genotype was statistically significant. In contrast, our findings for the main effects of life stressors (strong risk factor) and 5-HTTLPR genotype (no impact on risk) are strikingly consistent across our contributing studies, the original study reporting the interaction and subsequent meta-analyses. Our conclusion is that if an interaction exists in which the S allele of 5-HTTLPR increases risk of depression only in stressed individuals, then it is not broadly generalisable, but must be of modest effect size and only observable in limited situations.",Collaborative meta-analysis finds no evidence of a strong interaction between stress and 5-HTTLPR genotype contributing to the development of depression.

"Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB) belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler family, and CSB is the only ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler essential for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision DNA repair. CSB alone remodels nucleosomes approximately 10-fold slower than the ACF remodeling complex. Strikingly, NAP1-like histone chaperones interact with CSB and greatly enhance CSB-mediated chromatin remodeling. While chromatin remodeling by CSB and NAP1-like proteins is crucial for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair, the mechanism by which NAP1-like proteins enhance chromatin remodeling by CSB remains unknown. Here we studied CSB's DNA-binding and nucleosome-remodeling activities at the single molecule level in real time. We also determined how the NAP1L1 chaperone modulates these activities. We found that CSB interacts with DNA in two principle ways: by simple binding and a more complex association that involves gross DNA distortion. Remarkably, NAP1L1 suppresses both these interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate that nucleosome remodeling by CSB consists of three distinct phases: activation, translocation and pausing, similar to ACF. Importantly, we found that NAP1L1 promotes CSB-mediated remodeling by accelerating both activation and translocation. Additionally, NAP1L1 increases CSB processivity by decreasing the pausing probability during translocation. Our study, therefore, uncovers the different steps of CSB-mediated chromatin remodeling that can be regulated by NAP1L1.",NAP1L1 accelerates activation and decreases pausing to enhance nucleosome remodeling by CSB.
"STUDY QUESTION: Are single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in Aurora kinases B and C (AURKB, AURKC) associated with risk of aneuploid conception? SUMMARY ANSWER: Two SNVs were found in patients with extreme aneuploid concepti rates with respect to their age; one variant, AURKC p.I79V, is benign, while another, AURKB p.L39P, is a potential gain-of-function mutant with increased efficiency in promoting chromosome alignment. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Maternal age does not always predict aneuploidy risk, and rare gene variants can be drivers of disease. The AURKB and AURKC regulate chromosome segregation, and are associated with reproductive impairments in mouse and human. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: An extreme phenotype sample selection scheme was performed for variant discovery. Ninety-six DNA samples were from young patients with higher than average embryonic aneuploidy rates and an additional 96 DNA samples were from older patients with lower than average aneuploidy rates. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Using the192 DNA samples, the coding regions of AURKB and AURKC were sequenced using next generation sequencing. To assess biological significance, we expressed complementary RNA encoding the human variants in mouse oocytes. Assays such as determining subcellular localization and assessing catalytic activity were performed to determine alterations in protein function during meiosis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Ten SNVs were identified using three independent variant-calling methods. Two of the SNVs (AURKB p.L39P and AURKC p.I79V) were non-synonymous and identified by at least two variant-identification methods. The variant encoding AURKC p.I79V, identified in a young woman with a higher than average rate of aneuploid embryos, showed wild-type localization pattern and catalytic activity. On the other hand, the variant encoding AURKB p.L39P, identified in an older woman with lower than average rates of aneuploid embryos, increased the protein's ability to regulate alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate. These experiments were repeated three independent times using 2-3 mice for each trial. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Biological significance of the human variants was assessed in an in vitro mouse oocyte model where the variants are over-expressed. Therefore, the human protein may not function identically to the mouse homolog, or the same in mouse oocytes as in human oocytes. Furthermore, supraphysiological expression levels may not accurately reflect endogenous activity. Moreover, the evaluated variants were identified in one patient each, and no trial linking the SNV to pregnancy outcomes was conducted. Finally, the patient aneuploidy rates were established by performing comprehensive chromosome screening in blastocysts, and because of the link between female gamete aneuploidy giving rise to aneuploid embryos, we evaluate the role of the variants in Meiosis I. However, it is possible that the chromosome segregation mistake arose during Meiosis II or in mitosis in the preimplantation embryo. Their implications in human female meiosis and aneuploidy risk remain to be determined. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The data provide evidence that gene variants exist in reproductively younger or advanced aged women that are predictive of the risk of producing aneuploid concepti in humans. Furthermore, a single amino acid in the N-terminus of AURKB is a gain-of-function mutant that could be protective of euploidy.

"INTRODUCTION: The cutaneous microbiome maintains skin barrier function, regulates inflammation, and stimulates wound-healing responses. Burn injury promotes an excessive activation of the cutaneous and systemic immune response directed against commensal and invading pathogens. Skin grafting is the primary method of reconstructing full-thickness burns, and wound infection continues to be a significant complication. METHODS: In this study, the cutaneous bacterial microbiome was evaluated and subsequently compared to patient outcomes. Three different full-thickness skin specimens were assessed: control skin from non-burned subjects; burn margin from burn patients; and autologous donor skin from the same cohort of burn patients. RESULTS: We observed that skin bacterial community structure of burn patients was significantly altered compared with control patients. We determined that the unburned autologous donor skin from burn patients exhibits a microbiome similar to that of the burn margin, rather than unburned controls, and that changes in the cutaneous microbiome statistically correlate with several post-burn complications. We established that Corynebacterium positively correlated with burn wound infection, while Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium negatively correlated with burn wound infection. Both Corynebacterium and Enterococcus negatively correlated with the development of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies distinct differences in the cutaneous microbiome between burn subjects and unburned controls, and ascertains that select bacterial taxa significantly correlate with several comorbid complications of burn injury. These preliminary data suggest that grafting donor skin exhibiting bacterial dysbiosis may augment infection and/or graft failure and sets the foundation for more in-depth and mechanistic analyses in presumably ""healthy"" donor skin from patients requiring skin grafting procedures.",Cutaneous Burn Injury Promotes Shifts in the Bacterial Microbiome in Autologous Donor Skin: Implications for Skin Grafting Outcomes.
"OBJECTIVES: Data on the outcomes of children with perianal Crohn disease (pCD) are limited, although its presence is often used for justifying early use of biologics. We aimed to assess whether pCD in children is associated with more severe outcomes as found in adults. METHODS: Data were extracted from the ImageKids database, a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study. The study enrolled 246 children at disease onset or thereafter. All patients underwent comprehensive clinical, endoscopic, and radiologic evaluation at enrollment; 98 children had repeat evaluation at 18 months. RESULTS: Of the 234 included patients (mean age 14.2 +/- 2.4 years; 131 [56%] boys), 57 (24%) had perianal findings, whereas only 21 (9%) had fistulizing perianal disease. Children with pCD had reduced weight and height z scores compared with non-pCD patients (-0.9 vs -0.35, P = 0.03 and -0.68 vs -0.23, respectively; P = 0.04), higher weighted pediatric CD activity index (32 [interquartile range 16-50] vs 20 [8-37]; P = 0.004), lower serum albumin (3.6 +/- 0.7 vs 4.5 +/- 0.8, P = 0.016), and higher magnetic resonance enterography global inflammatory score (P = 0.04). Children with pCD had more rectal (57% vs 38%, P = 0.04), and jejunal involvement (31% vs 11% P = 0.003) and a higher prevalence of granulomas (64% vs 23%, P = 0.0001). Magnetic resonance enterography-based damage scores did not differ between groups. Patients with skin tags/fissures only, had similar clinical, endoscopic, and radiologic characteristics as patients with no perianal findings. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with pCD with fistulizing disease have distinct phenotypic features and a predisposition to a greater inflammatory burden.",Perianal Pediatric Crohn Disease Is Associated With a Distinct Phenotype and Greater Inflammatory Burden.
"CONTEXT: - With the decrease in the cost of sequencing, the clinical testing paradigm has shifted from single gene to gene panel and now whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. Clinical laboratories are rapidly implementing next-generation sequencing-based whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. Because a large number of targets are covered by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, it is critical that a laboratory perform appropriate validation studies, develop a quality assurance and quality control program, and participate in proficiency testing. OBJECTIVE: - To provide recommendations for whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing assay design, validation, and implementation for the detection of germline variants associated in inherited disorders. DATA SOURCES: - An example of trio sequencing, filtration and annotation of variants, and phenotypic consideration to arrive at clinical diagnosis is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: - It is critical that clinical laboratories planning to implement whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing design and validate the assay to specifications and ensure adequate performance prior to implementation. Test design specifications, including variant filtering and annotation, phenotypic consideration, guidance on consenting options, and reporting of incidental findings, are provided. These are important steps a laboratory must take to validate and implement whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing in a clinical setting for germline variants in inherited disorders.",Development and Validation of Clinical Whole-Exome and Whole-Genome Sequencing for Detection of Germline Variants in Inherited Disease.
"Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, and its prevalence has been projected to grow by 40% in the next decade. This increasing prevalence has implications for the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and also for chronic kidney disease (CKD). A high body mass index is one of the strongest risk factors for new-onset CKD. In individuals affected by obesity, a compensatory hyperfiltration occurs to meet the heightened metabolic demands of the increased body weight. The increase in intraglomerular pressure can damage the kidneys and raise the risk of developing CKD in the long-term. The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy has increased tenfold in recent years. Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis, and for a number of malignancies including kidney cancer. This year the World Kidney Day promotes education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyle, and health policy measures that makes preventive behaviors an affordable option.",Obesity and kidney disease: Hidden consequences of the epidemic.
"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that patients are generally accepting of their enrollment in trials for emergency care conducted under exception from informed consent. It is unknown whether individuals with more severe initial injuries or worse clinical outcomes have different perspectives. Determining whether these differences exist may help to structure post-enrollment interactions. METHODS: Primary clinical data from the Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury trial were matched to interview data from the Patients' Experiences in Emergency Research-Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury study. Answers to three key questions from Patients' Experiences in Emergency Research-Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury study were analyzed in the context of enrolled patients' initial injury severity (initial Glasgow Coma Scale and Injury Severity Score) and principal clinical outcomes (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale relative to initial injury severity). The three key questions from Patients' Experiences in Emergency Research-Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury study addressed participants' general attitude toward inclusion in the Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury trial (general trial inclusion), their specific attitude toward being included in Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury trial under the exception from informed consent (personal exception from informed consent enrollment), and their attitude toward the use of exception from informed consent in the Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury trial in general (general exception from informed consent enrollment). Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts was performed to provide contextualization and to determine the extent to which respondents framed their attitudes in terms of clinical experience. RESULTS: Clinical data from Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury trial were available for all 74 patients represented in the Patients' Experiences in Emergency Research-Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury study (including 46 patients for whom the surrogate was interviewed due to the patient's cognitive status or death). No significant difference was observed regarding acceptance of general trial inclusion or acceptance of general exception from informed consent enrollment between participants with favorable neurological outcomes and those with unfavorable outcomes relative to initial injury. Agreement with personal enrollment in Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury trial under exception from informed consent, however, was significantly higher among participants with favorable outcomes compared to those with unfavorable outcomes (89% vs 59%, p = 0.003). There was also a statistically significant relationship between more severe initial injury and increased acceptance of personal exception from informed consent enrollment ( p = 0.040) or general exception from informed consent use ( p = 0.034) in Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury trial. Many individuals referenced personal experience as a basis for their attitudes, but these references were not used to support negative views. CONCLUSION: Patients and surrogates of patients with unfavorable clinical outcomes were somewhat less accepting of their own inclusion in the Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury trial under exception from informed consent than were patients or surrogates of patients with favorable clinical outcomes. These findings suggest a need to identify optimal strategies for communicating with patients and their surrogates regarding exception from informed consent enrollment when clinical outcomes are poor.",Impact of individual clinical outcomes on trial participants' perspectives on enrollment in emergency research without consent.

"Despite a great deal of prior research, the early pathogenic events in natural oral poliovirus infection remain poorly defined. To establish a model for study, we infected 39 macaques by feeding them single high doses of the virulent Mahoney strain of wild type 1 poliovirus. Doses ranging from 10(7) to 10(9) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) consistently infected all the animals, and many monkeys receiving 10(8) or 10(9) TCID50 developed paralysis. There was no apparent difference in the susceptibilities of the three macaque species (rhesus, cynomolgus, and bonnet) used. Virus excretion in stool and nasopharynges was consistently observed, with occasional viremia, and virus was isolated from tonsils, gut mucosa, and draining lymph nodes. Viral replication proteins were detected in both epithelial and lymphoid cell populations expressing CD155 in the tonsil and intestine, as well as in spinal cord neurons. Necrosis was observed in these three cell types, and viral replication in the tonsil/gut was associated with histopathologic destruction and inflammation. The sustained response of neutralizing antibody correlated temporally with resolution of viremia and termination of virus shedding in oropharynges and feces. For the first time, this model demonstrates that early in the infectious process, poliovirus replication occurs in both epithelial cells (explaining virus shedding in the gastrointestinal tract) and lymphoid/monocytic cells in tonsils and Peyer's patches (explaining viremia), extending previous studies of poliovirus pathogenesis in humans. Because the model recapitulates human poliovirus infection and poliomyelitis, it can be used to study polio pathogenesis and to assess the efficacy of candidate antiviral drugs and new vaccines.IMPORTANCE Early pathogenic events of poliovirus infection remain largely undefined, and there is a lack of animal models mimicking natural oral human infection leading to paralytic poliomyelitis. All 39 macaques fed with single high doses ranging from 10(7) to 10(9) TCID50 Mahoney type 1 virus were infected, and many of the monkeys developed paralysis. Virus excretion in stool and nasopharynges was consistently observed, with occasional viremia; tonsil, mesentery lymph nodes, and intestinal mucosa served as major target sites of viral replication. For the first time, this model demonstrates that early in the infectious process, poliovirus replication occurs in both epithelial cells (explaining virus shedding in the gastrointestinal tract) and lymphoid/monocytic cells in tonsils and Peyer's patches (explaining viremia), thereby supplementing historical reconstructions of poliovirus pathogenesis.

"PURPOSE: The Chiefs' Service (CS), a structured approach to inpatient teaching rounds, focuses on resident education and patient-centered care without disrupting patient census sizes or admitting cycles. It has five key elements: morning huddles; bedside rounds; diagnostic ""time-outs""; day-of-discharge rounds; and postdischarge follow-up rounds. The authors hypothesized the CS model would be well received by residents and considered more effective than more-traditional rounds. METHOD: The CS was implemented on Penn Presbyterian Medical Center's general medicine inpatient service using a quasi-experimental design. Its first year (January 2013-January 2014) was evaluated with a mixed-methods approach. Residents completed end-of-rotation evaluation questionnaires; 20 CS and 10 traditional service (TS) residents were interviewed. Measures of resident agreement on questionnaire items were compared across groups using independent sample t testing. A modified grounded theory approach was used to assess CS residents' perspectives on the CS elements and identify emergent themes. RESULTS: The questionnaires were completed by 183/188 residents (response rate 97%). Compared with TS residents, CS residents reported significantly greater satisfaction in the domains of resident education and patient care, and they rated the overall value of the rotation significantly higher. The majority of CS residents found the CS elements to be effective. CS residents described the CS as focused on resident education, patient-centered care, and collaboration with an interdisciplinary team. CONCLUSIONS: The CS approach to inpatient rounding is seen by residents as valuable and is associated with positive outcomes in terms of residents' perceptions of learning, interdisciplinary communication, and patient care.",Bringing Rounds Back to the Patient: A One-Year Evaluation of the Chiefs' Service Model for Inpatient Teaching.

"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to (1) assess the reasons for pediatric interfacility transfers as identified by transferring providers and review the emergency medical care delivered at the receiving facilities and (2) investigate the emergency department (ED) care among the subpopulation of patients discharged from the receiving facility. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, cross-sectional survey of ED medical providers transferring patients younger than 18 years to 1 of 4 US tertiary care pediatric hospitals with a subsequent medical record review at the receiving facility. Referring providers completed surveys detailing reasons for transfer. RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-nine surveys were completed by 641 providers for 25 months. The median patient age was 5.7 years. Sixty-two percent of the patients required admission. The most common reasons for transfer as cited by referring providers were subspecialist consultation (62%) and admission to a pediatric inpatient (17%) or intensive care (6%) unit. For discharged patients, plain radiography (26%) and ultrasonography (12%) were the most common radiologic studies. Procedural sedation (16%) was the most common ED procedure for discharged patients, and 55% had a subspecialist consult at the receiving facility. Ten percent of interfacility transfers did not require subspecialty consult, ED procedure, radiologic study, or admission. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 4 of 10 interfacility transfers are discharged by the receiving facility, suggesting an opportunity to provide more comprehensive care at referring facilities. On the basis of the care provided at the receiving facility, potential interventions might include increased subspecialty access and developing both ultrasound and sedation capabilities.",Reasons for Interfacility Emergency Department Transfer and Care at the Receiving Facility.

"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, X-linked, muscle-wasting disorder caused by mutations in the large, 2.4-Mb dystrophin gene. The majority of DMD-causing mutations are sporadic, multi-exon, frameshifting deletions, with the potential for variable immunological tolerance to the dystrophin protein from patient to patient. While systemic gene therapy holds promise in the treatment of DMD, immune responses to vectors and transgenes must first be rigorously evaluated in informative preclinical models to ensure patient safety. A widely used canine model for DMD, golden retriever muscular dystrophy, expresses detectable amounts of near full-length dystrophin due to alternative splicing around an intronic point mutation, thereby confounding the interpretation of immune responses to dystrophin-derived gene therapies. Here we characterize a naturally occurring deletion in a dystrophin-null canine, the German shorthaired pointer. The deletion spans 5.6 Mb of the X chromosome and encompasses all coding exons of the DMD and TMEM47 genes. The sequences surrounding the deletion breakpoints are virtually identical, suggesting that the deletion occurred through a homologous recombination event. Interestingly, the deletion breakpoints are within loci that are syntenically conserved among mammals, yet the high homology among this subset of ferritin-like loci is unique to the canine genome, suggesting lineage-specific concerted evolution of these atypical sequence elements.",Mechanism of Deletion Removing All Dystrophin Exons in a Canine Model for DMD Implicates Concerted Evolution of X Chromosome Pseudogenes.
"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is one of the most common causes of reflux-like symptoms and feeding problems in children and food impaction and dysphagia in adults with a prevalence of 1:2500. Therapeutic options include diet, use of swallowed corticosteroids, or dilation. In the last several years, recent clinical and translational researches have identified some common and distinctive features, for example, the varying response to diet and medications. As EoE shares some characteristics with both asthma and inflammatory bowel disease, the advances in these fields suggest that various phenotypes may also exist in patients with EoE. Here, we provide a rationale for EoE phenotypes and provide some suggestions for potential phenotypes based on histology, molecular signature, response to therapy or dietary therapy.",Eosinophilic esophagitis phenotypes: Ready for prime time?
"Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) scan was shown to reduce lung cancer mortality in the National Lung Screening Trial, a large randomized controlled trial of high-risk current and former smokers. Despite ongoing uncertainty over the effectiveness of LDCT scan in the real-world setting, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) decided to cover LDCT scan as a preventive service. As part of its National Coverage Determination, CMS set forth a series of requirements for reimbursement of LDCT scan, including a counseling and shared decision-making visit prior to a LDCT scan being ordered. During this visit, providers must determine patient eligibility, engage in shared decision-making around LDCT scan, discuss the importance of adherence to screening, and provide smoking cessation counseling (if applicable). Two new billing codes were introduced for the counseling and shared decision-making visit and subsequent LDCT scan. In this review, we summarize the evidence around lung cancer screening and describe practical aspects of the counseling and shared decision-making, including billing considerations. We conclude with a discussion of the greater implications of CMS National Coverage Determination, especially as it pertains to quality assurance around new screening tests.",Low-Dose CT Scan for Lung Cancer Screening: Clinical and Coding Considerations.
"Background: Mid-level care providers serve as the backbone of primary care in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this, research suggests that the quality and consistency of this care is uneven. This study assessed the degree to which a set of four simple, low-cost interventions could improve adherence to a set of clinical quality measures (CQMs) associated with four common health conditions seen in a resource-constrained primary care setting. Methods: A quasi-experimental, longitudinal study was carried out in three primary care clinics in Nairobi, Kenya from August 2014 to January, 2015. Mid-level clinical officers (COs) at each clinic participated in four interventions aimed at improving CQM adherence. A group of temporary COs acted as a control group. Clinical encounter data were abstracted from eligible medical charts and assessed for CQM adherence. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were then fitted to these data to determine whether adherence to CQMs improved over time, and if this adherence differed by provider type and other characteristics. Results: Adherence to CQMs increased from 41.4% to 77.1% for COs that took part in the intervention, and dropped slightly from 26.5% to 21.8% for temporary COs over the 6-month study period. This difference was statistically different between treatment groups and suggests that environmental interventions alone cannot change behaviour. Adherence also varied significantly by health condition, but did not vary by provider gender, age or clinic site. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential for low-tech, low-cost interventions to improve the quality of care delivered by mid-level care providers in resource-constrained settings. Given the widespread utilization of mid-level care providers across sub-Saharan Africa, multicomponent interventions such as this one, that consist of simple educational modules and clinic-based feedback sessions, could lead to substantial improvements in the quality of primary care in these settings.",Evaluating the effects of organizational and educational interventions on adherence to clinical practice guidelines in a low-resource primary-care setting in Kenya.
"OBJECTIVE: Neurodevelopmental concerns in males with sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) (XXY/Klinefelter syndrome, XYY, XXYY) include symptoms seen in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), such as language impairments and social difficulties. We aimed to: (1) evaluate ASD characteristics in research cohorts of SCA males under DSM-IV compared to DSM-5 criteria, and (2) analyze factors associated with ASD diagnoses in SCA. METHODS: Evaluation of participants with XXY/KS (n=20), XYY (n=57) and XXYY (n=21) included medical history, cognitive/adaptive testing, Social Communication Questionnaire, Social Responsiveness Scale, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, and DSM ASD criteria. Clinical impressions of ASD diagnostic category using the ADOS and DSM-IV criteria were compared to ADOS-2 and DSM-5 criteria. T-tests compared cognitive, adaptive, SES and prenatal vs. postnatal diagnoses between ASD and no ASD groups. RESULTS: ASD rates in these research cohorts were 10% in XXY/KS, 38% in XYY, and 52% in XXYY using ADOS-2/DSM-5, and were not statistically different compared to DSM-IV criteria. In XYY and XXYY, the ASD group had lower verbal IQ and adaptive functioning compared to those without ASD. Many children without ASD still showed some social difficulties. CONCLUSION: ASD rates in males with SCA are higher than reported for the general population. Males with Y chromosome aneuploidy (XYY and XXYY) were 4.8 times more likely to have a diagnosis of ASD than the XXY/KS group, and 20 times more likely than males in the general population (1 in 42 males, CDC 2010). ASD should be considered when evaluating social difficulties in SCA. Studies of SCA and Y-chromosome genes may provide insight into male predominance in idiopathic ASD.","Autism Spectrum Disorder in Males with Sex Chromosome Aneuploidy: XXY/Klinefelter Syndrome, XYY, and XXYY."
"Objective: Spacing of educational material over time has been shown to improve learning efficiency and long-term knowledge retention. We evaluated the impact of adding a spaced education curriculum to a month-long pediatric rotation. Methods: This was a randomized controlled educational intervention trial of residents on a rotation in a pediatric emergency department. Participants were randomized to the standard curriculum or the standard curriculum with integrated spaced education. The intervention used an automated platform to electronically deliver questions to user e-mail or mobile devices and provided instant feedback. Our primary outcome was proportion of correctly answered questions following the rotation. Our secondary outcomes included test performance at 3 months, change in clinical confidence, and satisfaction with the spaced learning. Learner opinion of the platform was assessed by postrotation survey. Results: Of 194 eligible trainees, 122 were enrolled and randomized. A total of 107 of the enrolled residents (88%) completed the immediate postrotation assessment, 48 of whom received spaced education. Sixty residents completed the 3-month follow-up. There were no differences between the control and intervention groups in baseline knowledge. The intervention group performed better than the control group on the postrotation assessment (mean difference = 5.4%, 95% confidence interval = 0.1-10.7) when controlled for didactic attendance and clinical exposure. Change in confidence did not differ between groups. Eighty-seven percent of spaced education learners would participate in a similar model in the future. Conclusion: Spaced education during a pediatric emergency medicine rotation is an effective adjunct to a standard curriculum. Participants showed improvement on postrotation knowledge performance and enjoyed this educational approach.",A Randomized Educational Interventional Trial of Spaced Education During a Pediatric Rotation.
"BACKGROUND: For patients with the Fontan circulatory arrangement, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, guanylate cyclase activation, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition, and endothelin receptor antagonism have so far resulted in little or no improvement in [Formula: see text] or peak cardiac index (CI), suggesting that our understanding of the factors that most impact the exercise hemodynamics is incomplete. METHODS: To facilitate comparisons with clinical reports of the exercise performance of preadolescent Fontan patients, we rescaled our previously reported computational models of a two-year-old normal child and similarly aged Fontan patient, extended our Fontan model to capture the nonlinear relationship between flow and resistance quantified from previous computational fluid dynamic analyses of the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC), and added respiration as well as skeletal muscle contraction. RESULTS: (1) Without respiration, the computational model for both the normal and the Fontan cannot attain the values for CI at peak exercise reported in the clinical literature, (2) because flow through the TCPC is much greater during inspiration than during expiration, the effect on the CI of the dynamic (flow-related) TCPC resistance is much more dramatic during exercise than it is in breath-hold mode at rest, and (3) coupling breathing with skeletal muscle contraction leads to the highest augmentation of cardiac output, that is, the skeletal muscle pump is most effective when the intrathoracic pressure is at a minimum-at peak inspiration. CONCLUSIONS: Novel insights emerge when a Fontan model incorporating dynamic TCPC resistance, full respiration, and skeletal muscle contraction can be compared to the model of the normal.",Model-Based Comparison of the Normal and Fontan Circulatory Systems-Part III.
"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading cause of mortality in athletes during sport. A variety of mostly hereditary, structural, or electrical cardiac disorders are associated with SCD in young athletes, the majority of which can be identified or suggested by abnormalities on a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Whether used for diagnostic or screening purposes, physicians responsible for the cardiovascular care of athletes should be knowledgeable and competent in ECG interpretation in athletes. However, in most countries a shortage of physician expertise limits wider application of the ECG in the care of the athlete. A critical need exists for physician education in modern ECG interpretation that distinguishes normal physiological adaptations in athletes from distinctly abnormal findings suggestive of underlying pathology. Since the original 2010 European Society of Cardiology recommendations for ECG interpretation in athletes, ECG standards have evolved quickly over the last decade; pushed by a growing body of scientific data that both tests proposed criteria sets and establishes new evidence to guide refinements. On 26-27 February 2015, an international group of experts in sports cardiology, inherited cardiac disease, and sports medicine convened in Seattle, Washington, to update contemporary standards for ECG interpretation in athletes. The objective of the meeting was to define and revise ECG interpretation standards based on new and emerging research and to develop a clear guide to the proper evaluation of ECG abnormalities in athletes. This statement represents an international consensus for ECG interpretation in athletes and provides expert opinion-based recommendations linking specific ECG abnormalities and the secondary evaluation for conditions associated with SCD.",International recommendations for electrocardiographic interpretation in athletes.
"Chronic pain symptoms often change over time, even in individuals who have had symptoms for years. Studying biological factors that predict trends in symptom change in chronic pain may uncover novel pathophysiological mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we investigated whether brain functional connectivity measures obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline can predict longitudinal symptom change (3, 6, and 12 months after scan) in urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome. We studied 52 individuals with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (34 women, 18 men) who had baseline neuroimaging followed by symptom tracking every 2 weeks for 1 year as part of the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network study. We found that brain functional connectivity can make a significant prediction of short-term (3 month) pain reduction with 73.1% accuracy (69.2% sensitivity and 75.0% precision). In addition, we found that the brain regions with greatest contribution to the classification were preferentially aligned with the left frontoparietal network. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures seemed to be less informative about 6- or 12-month symptom change. Our study provides the first evidence that future trends in symptom change in patients in a state of chronic pain may be linked to functional connectivity within specific brain networks.",Resting-state functional connectivity predicts longitudinal pain symptom change in urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome: a MAPP network study.
"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of intraoperative neurological monitoring (IONM) alerts and neurological injury during vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) treatment and evaluate the utility of IONM during VEPTR expansion procedures in patients who have not previously had neurological injury or IONM alerts. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, VEPTR procedures and IONM records were reviewed at 17 institutions for patients treated with VEPTR from 2005 to 2011. All consecutive cases in patients with minimum 2-year follow-up were included. Patients with prior history of growing rods or other invasive spine-based surgical treatment were excluded. Surgeries were categorized into implant, revision, expansion, and removal procedures. Cases with IONM alerts or neurological injury had additional detailed review. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. RESULTS: In total, 2355 consecutive VEPTR procedures (352 patients) consisting of 299 implant, 377 revision, 1587 expansion, and 92 removal procedures were included. In total, 620 VEPTR procedures had IONM, and 539 of those had IONM records available for review. IONM alerts occurred in 9/539 procedures (1.7%): 3/192 implants (1.6%), 3/58 revisions (5.2%), and 3/258 expansions (1.2%). New neurological injury occurred in 3/2355 procedures (0.1%), 3/352 patients (0.9%). All 3 injuries were in implant procedures, only 1 had an IONM alert. All 3 had upper extremity motor deficits (1 had sensory deficit also). All had full recovery at 17, 30, and 124 days postinjury. One patient without prior neurological injury or IONM alert had an IONM alert during expansion that resolved after an increase in blood pressure. The remaining IONM alerts during expansions were all in children with prior IONM alerts during implant, revision, or exchange procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The highest rate of neurological injury in VEPTR surgery was found for implant procedures. There were no instances of neurological injury during VEPTR expansion, revision, or removal procedures. IONM did not identify new neurological injuries in patients undergoing VEPTR expansion who did not previously have a history of IONM signal change or neurologic injury.

"John Scott Haldane recognized that the administration of supplemental oxygen required titration in the individual. Although he made this observation in adults, it is equally applicable to the preterm newborn. But how, in practice, can the oxygen requirements in the preterm newborn be determined to avoid the consequences of too little and too much oxygen? Unfortunately, the current generation of oxygen saturation trials in preterm newborns guides saturation thresholds rather than individual oxygen requirements. For this reason, we propose an alternate model for the description of oxygen sufficiency. This model considers the adequacy of oxygen delivery relative to simultaneous consumption. We describe how measuring oxygen extraction or the venous oxygen reservoir could define a physiologically based definition of adequate oxygen. This definition would provide a clinically useful reference value while making irrelevant the absolute values of both oxygen delivery and consumption. Additional trials to test adjunctive, noninvasive measurements of oxygen status in high-risk preterm newborns are needed to minimize the effects of both insufficient and excessive oxygen exposure.","A Theoretical and Practical Approach to Defining ""Adequate Oxygenation"" in the Preterm Newborn."
"This study examined the effects of patient reluctance towards exposure on practitioners' subsequent treatment recommendations. Participants (N=236) were doctoral level psychologists who received a vignette of a patient with panic disorder, which either did (experimental group) or did not (control group) mention patient reluctance towards exposure. Evidence Based Practice (EBP) attitudes were also assessed and taken into account. A significant main effect of reluctance, averaged across all levels of EBP attitudes, and theoretical orientations was obtained (OR=2.85, 95% CI=[1.51, 5.39], p=0.001, RR=1.46), with controls 1.46 times more likely to recommend exposure. A significant main effect of EBP attitudes was also obtained (p<0.001). The odds of recommending exposure increased by 11% with each increase of positive EBP attitudes, across both levels of patient reluctance and theoretical orientation.",Does patient reluctance towards exposure and psychologists' attitudes about evidence based practice influence treatment recommendations for panic disorder?

"INTRODUCTION: Asthma is a chronic disease with significant health burden and socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities related to diagnosis and treatment. Asthma primarily affects the lungs, but can impact brain function through direct and indirect mechanisms. Some studies have suggested that asthma negatively impacts cognition, while others have failed to identify asthma-related cognitive compromise. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of cognition in individuals with asthma compared to that in healthy controls. We also examined the impact of some key potential moderators. METHOD: Data on cognitive outcome measures and sociodemographic, illness-related, and study-related variables were extracted from studies reporting cognitive test performance in individuals with asthma compared to that in controls. RESULTS: There was no evidence of publication bias. A random-effects model examining differences in task performance between 2017 individuals with asthma and 2131 healthy controls showed significant effects in the small to medium range. Cognitive deficits associated with asthma were global, with strongest effects on broader measures involving academic achievement and executive functioning, but with additional impact on processing speed, global intellect, attention, visuospatial functioning, language, learning, and memory. Severity of asthma was a key moderator, with greatest cognitive deficits associated with severe asthma. Cognitive burden was also greatest in asthma patients who were younger, males, from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and from racial/ethnic minorities. Effects were independent of type of population (child versus adult), type of study (norm-referenced versus control-referenced), or reported use of oral or inhaled corticosteroid medications. CONCLUSIONS: There is cognitive burden associated with asthma, particularly among vulnerable groups with severe asthma. This could be due to increased risk of intermittent cerebral hypoxia in severe asthma. The clinical need to assess cognition in individuals with asthma is underscored.",Is asthma associated with cognitive impairments? A meta-analytic review.
"Importance: Recent discussion has focused on questions related to the repeal and replacement of portions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, issues central to the future of health and health care in the United States transcend the ACA provisions receiving the greatest attention. Initiatives directed to certain strategic and infrastructure priorities are vital to achieve better health at lower cost. Objectives: To review the most salient health challenges and opportunities facing the United States, to identify practical and achievable priorities essential to health progress, and to present policy initiatives critical to the nation's health and fiscal integrity. Evidence Review: Qualitative synthesis of 19 National Academy of Medicine-commissioned white papers, with supplemental review and analysis of publicly available data and published research findings. Findings: The US health system faces major challenges. Health care costs remain high at $3.2 trillion spent annually, of which an estimated 30% is related to waste, inefficiencies, and excessive prices; health disparities are persistent and worsening; and the health and financial burdens of chronic illness and disability are straining families and communities. Concurrently, promising opportunities and knowledge to achieve change exist. Across the 19 discussion papers examined, 8 crosscutting policy directions were identified as vital to the nation's health and fiscal future, including 4 action priorities and 4 essential infrastructure needs. The action priorities-pay for value, empower people, activate communities, and connect care-recurred across the articles as direct and strategic opportunities to advance a more efficient, equitable, and patient- and community-focused health system. The essential infrastructure needs-measure what matters most, modernize skills, accelerate real-world evidence, and advance science-were the most commonly cited foundational elements to ensure progress. Conclusions and Relevance: The action priorities and essential infrastructure needs represent major opportunities to improve health outcomes and increase efficiency and value in the health system. As the new US administration and Congress chart the future of health and health care for the United States, and as health leaders across the country contemplate future directions for their programs and initiatives, their leadership and strategic investment in these priorities will be essential for achieving significant progress.",Vital Directions for Health and Health Care: Priorities From a National Academy of Medicine Initiative.
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the epidemiologic factors involved in the pathogenesis of pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS), which have been the focus of numerous studies in the last several years. We also review the clinical features (including diagnostic evaluation and differential diagnosis) of, treatment approach to, and prognosis of pediatric MS. RECENT FINDINGS: Up to 10% of patients with MS have their initial demyelinating before the age of 18 years. Over the past 15 years, international and collaborative studies have identified an increasing number of genetic and environmental risk factors for pediatric MS. Identification of these risks and their interplay allow for better understanding of the pathophysiology of pediatric MS, which may inform subsequent treatment and disease management. Careful attention to the management of relapses and chronic symptoms, including implementation of lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic interventions, enables improved school performance and quality of life. SUMMARY: Ongoing research in the field of pediatric MS aims to better understand the epidemiologic factors involved in the pathobiology, safety and efficacy of disease-modifying treatments, and long-term prognosis, particularly of cognitive development and academic potential. Collaborative, multinational studies will enable the advancements needed to truly optimize clinical care for this population.",Pediatric multiple sclerosis.

"BACKGROUND: Young, active candidates for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) are a unique group of patients. Not only do they demand longevity and improved function, but they also desire a return to physical activities. PURPOSE: To determine the rate of return to sports in patients aged </=55 years undergoing TSA. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent anatomic TSA at a single institution. Exclusion criteria included age at the time of surgery >55 years and <2 years of follow-up. All patients had end-stage osteoarthritis with significant glenohumeral joint space narrowing. The final follow-up consisted of a patient-reported sports questionnaire, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and visual analog scale (VAS) score. RESULTS: From 70 eligible patients, 59 patients (61 shoulders) were included with an average follow-up of 61.0 months (range, 25-103 months) and average age at the time of surgery of 48.9 years (range, 25-55 years). The average VAS score improved from 5.6 to 0.9 ( P < .001), and the average ASES score improved from 39.3 to 88.4 ( P < .001). Forty-nine procedures (80.3%) were performed for a primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Four shoulders returned to the operating room; none were for glenoid loosening. There was a 93.2% satisfaction rate, and 67.7% of patients (n = 40) stated that they underwent their surgery to return to sports. Moreover, patients in 96.4% of shoulders (55/57) restarted at least 1 sport at an average of 6.7 months. Direct rates of return were as follows: fitness sports (97.2%), golf (93.3%), singles tennis (87.5%), swimming (77.7%), basketball (75.0%), and flag football (66.7%). Patients in 47 shoulders (82.4%) returned to a similar or higher level of sports; 90.3% returned to high-demand sports, and 83.8% returned to high upper extremity sports. There was no significant difference in rates of return to sports by body mass index, sex, age, preoperative diagnosis, revision status, and dominant extremity. CONCLUSION: In patients aged </=55 years undergoing TSA, there was a 96.4% rate of return to >/=1 previous sports at an average of 6.7 months. Furthermore, at an average follow-up of 61.0 months, no patients needed revision of their glenoid component, despite an 83.8% rate of return to high upper extremity sports. While caution should still be advised in young, active patients undergoing TSA, these results demonstrate a high satisfaction rate and improved ability to return to most sports after surgery.",High Satisfaction and Return to Sports After Total Shoulder Arthroplasty in Patients Aged 55 Years and Younger.
"Many bullying prevention programs take a bystander approach, which encourages children to intervene when they are bystanders to bullying incidents. Little is known about how caregivers' advice to children might promote or undermine the positive bystander behaviors targeted by these programs. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to investigate relations between caregivers' advice and children's bystander behavior during bullying situations. Participants were 106 racially/ethnically diverse 4th- and 5th-grade students (M age = 10.5 years, SD = .71 years), their classmates, and their caregivers. During classroom visits, peers reported on children's bystander behaviors. During home visits, caregivers and children completed a coded interaction task in which caregivers advised children about how to respond to bullying situations at school. Results suggested that (a) bystander intervention was positively predicted by caregivers' advice to help/comfort the victim, (b) bystander passivity was positively predicted by caregivers' advice to not intervene and negatively predicted by caregivers' advice to help/comfort the victim, and (c) bystander reinforcement/assistance of the bully was positively predicted by caregivers' advice not to intervene and not to tell adults. Results support a link between caregivers' advice at home and children's corresponding behavior when they are bystanders to bullying situations at school. These results emphasize the importance of collaboration between families and schools to reduce school bullying. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.",Caregivers' Advice and Children's Bystander Behaviors During Bullying Incidents.

"Previous research shows that patients in integrated health systems experience fewer racial disparities compared with more traditional healthcare systems. Little is known about patterns of racial/ethnic disparities between safety-net and non safety-net integrated health systems.We evaluated racial/ethnic differences in body mass index (BMI) and the Charlson comorbidity index from 3 non safety-net- and 1 safety-net integrated health systems in a cross-sectional study. Multinomial logistic regression modeled comorbidity and BMI on race/ethnicity and health care system type adjusting for age, sex, insurance, and zip-code-level incomeThe study included 1.38 million patients. Higher proportions of safety-net versus non safety-net patients had comorbidity score of 3+ (11.1% vs. 5.0%) and BMI >/=35 (27.7% vs. 15.8%). In both types of systems, blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whites to have higher BMIs. Whites were more likely than blacks or Hispanics to have higher comorbidity scores in a safety net system, but less likely to have higher scores in the non safety-nets. The odds of comorbidity score 3+ and BMI 35+ in blacks relative to whites were significantly lower in safety-net than in non safety-net settings.Racial/ethnic differences were present within both safety-net and non safety-net integrated health systems, but patterns differed. Understanding patterns of racial/ethnic differences in health outcomes in safety-net and non safety-net integrated health systems is important to tailor interventions to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care.",Racial/ethnic differences in obesity and comorbidities between safety-net- and non safety-net integrated health systems.
"BACKGROUND: Restrictive feeding is associated with child overweight; however, the majority of studies used parent-report questionnaires. OBJECTIVES: The relationship between child adiposity measures and directly observed parent and child behaviours were tested using a novel behavioural coding system (BCS). METHODS: Data from 109 children, participants in a twin study and their mothers, were analyzed. Parent-child dyads were video-recorded twice in the laboratory, while children ate ad libitum from a buffet lunch. Mother and child behaviours were assessed using the BCS. Height, body weight and body fat were directly measured for each child. Associations between child adiposity measures and average BCS behaviour (i.e. pooled across visits) were tested using partial correlations adjusting for child age. RESULTS: Regarding discouragement prompts, child body mass index (BMI) z-score was significantly associated with a greater rate of total discouragements (per minute, min(-1) ), nonverbal discouragements (min(-1) ) and temporary (delay) discouragements (min(-1) ) (p < 0.05). Child percent body fat was associated with greater nonverbal discouragements (min(-1) ). Regarding encouragement prompts, child BMI z-score was significantly associated with a greater rate of total encouragements (min(-1) ), nonverbal encouragements (min(-1) ) and reward encouragements (min(-1) ). Child BMI z-score and percent body fat were both positively associated with greater maternal health encouragements (min(-1) ). Associations with encouragement to eat prompts were no longer significant when accounting for the dependence among twins (being part of the same family). CONCLUSIONS: Heavier children received greater maternal discouragements to eat and, with qualifications, encouragements to eat. The role of nonverbal parenting cues warrants further research regarding child eating regulation and obesity.",Observed parent-child feeding dynamics in relation to child body mass index and adiposity.

"Endothelial injury is implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD and emphysema; however the role of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), a marker of endothelial cell repair, and circulating endothelial cells (CECs), a marker of endothelial cell injury, in COPD and its subphenotypes is unresolved. We hypothesized that endothelial progenitor cell populations would be decreased in COPD and emphysema and that circulating endothelial cells would be increased. Associations with other subphenotypes were examined. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis COPD Study recruited smokers with COPD and controls age 50-79 years without clinical cardiovascular disease. Endothelial progenitor cell populations (CD34+KDR+ and CD34+KDR+CD133+ cells) and circulating endothelial cells (CD45dimCD31+CD146+CD133-) were measured by flow cytometry. COPD was defined by standard spirometric criteria. Emphysema was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively on CT. Full pulmonary function testing and expiratory CTs were measured in a subset. Among 257 participants, both endothelial progenitor cell populations, and particularly CD34+KDR+ endothelial progenitor cells, were reduced in COPD. The CD34+KDR+CD133+ endothelial progenitor cells were associated inversely with emphysema extent. Both endothelial progenitor cell populations were associated inversely with extent of panlobular emphysema and positively with diffusing capacity. Circulating endothelial cells were not significantly altered in COPD but were inversely associated with pulmonary microvascular blood flow on MRI. There was no consistent association of endothelial progenitor cells or circulating endothelial cells with measures of gas trapping. These data provide evidence that endothelial repair is impaired in COPD and suggest that this pathological process is specific to emphysema.",Endothelial progenitor cells in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema.
"OBJECTIVE: The quality of primary care delivered to Medicaid-insured children with disabilities (CWD) is unknown. We used the newly validated CWD algorithm (CWDA) to examine CWD prevalence among Medicaid enrollees 1 to 18 years old, primary care quality for CWD, and differences in primary care quality for CWD and non-CWD. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using 2008 Medicaid Analytic eXtract claims data from 9 states, including children with at least 11 months of enrollment (N = 2,671,922 enrollees). We utilized CWDA to identify CWD and applied 12 validated or endorsed pediatric quality measures to assess preventive/screening, acute, and chronic disease care quality. We compared quality for CWD and non-CWD unmatched and matched on age, sex, and number of nondisabling chronic conditions and outpatient encounters. RESULTS: CWDA identified 5.3% (n = 141,384) of our study population as CWD. Care quality levels for CWD were below 50% on 8 of 12 quality measures (eg, adolescent well visits [44.9%], alcohol/drug treatment engagement [24.9%]). CWD care quality was significantly better than the general population of non-CWD by +0.9% to +15.6% on 9 measures, but significantly worse for 2 measures, chlamydia screening (-3.4%) and no emergency department visits for asthma (-5.0%; all P < .01 to .001). Differences in care quality between CWD and non-CWD were generally smaller or changed direction when CWD were compared to a general population or matched group of non-CWD. CONCLUSIONS: One in 20 Medicaid-insured children is CWD, and the quality of primary care delivered to CWD is suboptimal. Areas needing improvement include preventive/screening, acute care, and chronic disease management.",Quality of Primary Care for Children With Disabilities Enrolled in Medicaid.
"AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of contrast enemas (CEs) for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease (HD). METHODS AND MATERIALS: CE studies performed as part of an HD workup in patients 1-18 years of age over a 10-year period were identified. All abnormal CE studies and an equal number of age-matched controls were included in the final study group. Two radiologists independently and blindly reviewed all CE studies for quality (scale of 0-3) and the presence of large colon calibre, colon redundancy, transition zone, rectosigmoid ratio, and abnormal contractions. Readers also determined whether a rectal biopsy would be recommended to confirm an HD diagnosis. Discrepancies were resolved in consensus. Findings were correlated with surgery and biopsy data. RESULTS: Out of 834 CE studies, 38 abnormal CE studies were identified (mean age 5.9 years) and included 38 matched controls. Seventeen of 76 patients were recommended for rectal biopsy, of which five were confirmed to have HD. Twelve of 70 (17.1%) were false positives, and were clinically confirmed not to have HD. The proportion of HD in the present population was 6/834 (0.72%). Of the 17 recommended for biopsy, CE studies showed 17/17 (100%) with an abnormal rectosigmoid ratio, 16/17 (94.1%) with redundant colon, and 15/17 (88%) with large colon. Of patients not recommended for biopsy, one was diagnosed with HD, (false negative, 16.7%). The diagnostic performance of CE was 83.3% sensitivity and 82.9% specificity. CONCLUSION: Few children >1 year of age were found to have HD and the diagnostic performance of the CE is moderately high. The CE examination is a valuable non-invasive imaging study to help exclude older children who may not have HD, thereby obviating the need for invasive rectal biopsy and surgery.",Radiologist performance in the interpretation of contrast enemas performed for Hirschsprung's disease in children >1 year of age.
"Advanced respiratory diseases progress over time and often lead to death. As the condition worsens, patients may lose medical decision-making ability. Advance care planning (ACP) is a process in which patients receive information about their diagnosis and prognosis; discuss values, goals, and fears; articulate preferences about life-sustaining treatments and end-of-life care; and appoint a surrogate medical decision maker. This process may result in written documentation of patient preferences or the appointment of a health-care power of attorney (HCPOA). ACP discussions have multiple benefits for patients and their surrogate decision makers, including ensuring that the care provided is aligned with the patient's goals and preferences and decreasing stress, anxiety, and burden in surrogates. Time and provider comfort are often cited barriers to ACP, so it may be necessary for clinicians to gain experience in conversations and identify the patients most likely to benefit from ACP discussions. Two new Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, 99497 and 99498, have been recognized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as of January 1, 2016 and are intended to incentivize clinicians to engage in ACP discussions with their patients earlier and with more frequency. This manuscript reviews the benefits and barriers to ACP in patients with advanced respiratory disease and provides guidance on the use of the new CPT codes for reimbursement of these conversations.",Integrating Advance Care Planning Into Practice.
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive fibrotic lung disease, and eventually most patients develop respiratory failure with a median survival rate of 2 to 3 years after diagnosis due to the lack of clinically effective therapies. Mogroside IIIE (MGIIIE), a cucurbitane-type compound, was isolated from Siraitia grosvenorii MGIIIE has shown the strongest inhibition of nitric oxide release, a crucial inflammatory factor, from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 cells compared with other mogrosides. In the pulmonary fibrosis mouse model induced by bleomycin, MGIIIE treatment attenuated pulmonary fibrosis, indicated as a reduction in myeloperoxidase activity, collagen deposition, and pathologic score. MGIIIE also significantly suppressed expression of several important fibrotic markers, e.g., alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen I, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signal, and metalloproteinases-9/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. Furthermore, MGIIIE blocked tansdifferentiation of lung resident fibroblasts into myofibroblast-like cells induced by TGF-beta or LPS and subsequently inhibited collagen production in lung fibroblasts. These data indicate that MGIIIE is a potent inhibitor for pulmonary fibrosis. In vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies have shown that MGIIIE significantly decreased expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its downstream signals of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), an inflammatory signal essential for extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in pulmonary fibroblasts. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MGIIIE significantly prevents pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting pulmonary inflammation and ECM deposition through regulating TLR4/MyD88-MAPK signaling. Our study suggests that MGIIIE may have therapeutic potential for treating pulmonary fibrosis in clinical settings.","Mogroside IIIE, a Novel Anti-Fibrotic Compound, Reduces Pulmonary Fibrosis through Toll-Like Receptor 4 Pathways."
"PURPOSE: For children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and at low risk category of stroke, we aim to build a predictive model to differentiate those with decline of intelligence-quotient (IQ) from counterparts without decline, based on structural magnetic-resonance (MR) imaging volumetric analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This preliminary prospective cohort study included 25 children with SCD, homozygous for hemoglobin S, with no history of stroke and transcranial Doppler mean velocities below 170cm/s at baseline. We administered the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT) to each child at yearly intervals for 2-4 years. Each child underwent MR examination within 30 days of the baseline K-BIT evaluation date. We calculated K-BIT change rates, and used rate of change in K-BIT to classify children into two groups: a decline group and a non-decline group. We then generated predictive models to predict K-BIT decline/non-decline based on regional gray-matter (GM) volumes computed from structural MR images. RESULTS: We identified six structures (the left median cingulate gyrus, the right middle occipital gyrus, the left inferior occipital gyrus, the right fusiform gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, the right inferior temporal gyrus) that, when assessed for volume at baseline, are jointly predictive of whether a child would suffer subsequent K-BIT decline. Based on these six regional GM volumes and the baseline K-BIT, we built a prognostic model using the K(*) algorithm. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 0.84, 0.78 and 0.86, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: GM volumetric analysis predicts subsequent IQ decline for children with SCD.",Brain morphometric analysis predicts decline of intelligence quotient in children with sickle cell disease: A preliminary study.
"The EepR transcription factor positively regulates secondary metabolites and tissue-damaging metalloproteases. To gain insight into mechanisms by which EepR regulates pigment and co-regulated factors, genetic suppressor analysis was performed. Suppressor mutations that restored pigment to the non-pigmented eepR mutant mapped to the hexS ORF. Mutation of hexS also restored haemolysis, swarming motility and protease production to the eepR mutant. HexS is a known direct and negative regulator of secondary metabolites in Serratia marcescens and is a LysR family regulator and an orthologue of LrhA. Here, we demonstrate that HexS directly controls eepR and the serralysin gene prtS. EepR was shown to directly regulate eepR expression but indirectly regulate hexS expression. Together, these data indicate that EepR and HexS oppose each other in controlling stationary phase-associated molecules and enzymes.",Suppressor analysis of eepR mutant defects reveals coordinate regulation of secondary metabolites and serralysin biosynthesis by EepR and HexS.
"OBJECTIVE: Patient-based congenital heart surgery (CHS) training is opportunity-based and difficult. Three-dimensional (3D) print models of the heart were used for hands-on surgical training (HOST) at the 2015 AATS and subsequently in 2 local institutions. We aim to introduce the process of 3D printing for surgical simulation and to present the attendee's responses. METHODS: Using CT or MR angiograms, the models of congenital heart disease were created and printed with flexible rubberlike material. Altogether, 81 established surgeons or trainees performed simulated surgical procedures with the expert surgeons' guidance and supervision. At the completion of the session, 50 of 81 attendees participated in the questionnaire assessment of the program. RESULTS: All responders found the course helpful in improving their surgical skills. All would consider including HOST sessions in the training programs. All found that the models showed the necessary pathologic findings. Most found that the consistency and elasticity of the model material were different from those of the human myocardium. However, the responders thought that the quality of the models was acceptable (88%) or manageable (12%) for surgical practice. The major weaknesses listed were related to the print material and poor representation of the cardiac valves. CONCLUSIONS: HOST using 3D print heart models is achievable and allows surgical practice on pathological hearts without patients' risk. HOST is a highly applicable surgical simulation format for CHS. Incorporation of HOST in training programs could change the traditional opportunity-based education to the requirement-based standardized education.",Hands-on surgical training of congenital heart surgery using 3-dimensional print models.

While the superficial manifestations of KTS predominantly affect the extremities, patients frequently develop abnormalities of the pulmonary arterial system, particularly chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, some patients are seen to develop pulmonary arteriolar aneurysms; the physiologic significance of this finding is unknown at this time. Radiologists should be aware of these potential findings and have a high index of suspicion for chronic PE in patients with KTS.",Thoracic Manifestations of Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome.
"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess surgical availability and readiness in 8 African countries using the WHO's Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool. SETTING: We analysed data for surgical services, including basic and comprehensive surgery, comprehensive obstetric care, blood transfusion, and infection prevention, obtained from the WHO's SARA surveys in Sierra Leone, Uganda, Mauritania, Benin, Zambia, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo and Togo. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Among the facilities that were expected to offer surgical services (N=3492), there were wide disparities between the countries in the number of facilities per 100 000 population that reported offering basic surgery (1.0-12.1), comprehensive surgery (0.1-0.8), comprehensive obstetric care (0.1-0.8) and blood transfusion (0.1-0.8). Only 0.1-0.3 facilities per 100 000 population had all three bellwether procedures available, namely laparotomy, open fracture management and caesarean section. In all the countries, the facilities that reported offering surgical services generally had a shortage of the necessary items for offering the services and this varied greatly between the countries, with the facilities having on average 27-53% of the items necessary for offering basic surgery, 56-83% for comprehensive surgery, 49-72% for comprehensive obstetric care and 54-80% for blood transfusion. Furthermore, few facilities had all the necessary items present. However, facilities that reported offering surgical services had on average most of the necessary items for the prevention of infection. CONCLUSIONS: There are important gaps in the surgical services in the 8 African countries surveyed. Efforts are therefore urgently needed to address deficiencies in the availability and readiness to deliver surgical services in these nations, and this will require commitment from multiple stakeholders. SARA may be used to monitor availability and readiness at regular intervals, which will enable stakeholders to evaluate progress and identify gaps and areas for improvement.",Retrospective review of Surgical Availability and Readiness in 8 African countries.
"Importance: Although implicit bias in medical training has long been suspected, it has been difficult to study using objective measures, and the influence of sex and gender in the evaluation of medical trainees is unknown. The emergency medicine (EM) milestones provide a standardized framework for longitudinal resident assessment, allowing for analysis of resident performance across all years and programs at a scope and level of detail never previously possible. Objective: To compare faculty-observed training milestone attainment of male vs female residency training. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, longitudinal, retrospective cohort study took place at 8 community and academic EM training programs across the United States from July 1, 2013, to July 1, 2015, using a real-time, mobile-based, direct-observation evaluation tool. The study examined 33456 direct-observation subcompetency evaluations of 359 EM residents by 285 faculty members. Main Outcomes and Measures: Milestone attainment for male and female EM residents as observed by male and female faculty throughout residency and analyzed using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression modeling. Results: A total of 33456 direct-observation evaluations were collected from 359 EM residents (237 men [66.0%] and 122 women [34.0%]) by 285 faculty members (194 men [68.1%] and 91 women [31.9%]) during the study period. Female and male residents achieved similar milestone levels during the first year of residency. However, the rate of milestone attainment was 12.7% (0.07 levels per year) higher for male residents through all of residency (95% CI, 0.04-0.09). By graduation, men scored approximately 0.15 milestone levels higher than women, which is equivalent to 3 to 4 months of additional training, given that the average resident gains approximately 0.52 levels per year using our model (95% CI, 0.49-0.54). No statistically significant differences in scores were found based on faculty evaluator gender (effect size difference, 0.02 milestone levels; 95% CI for males, -0.09 to 0.11) or evaluator-evaluatee gender pairing (effect size difference, -0.02 milestone levels; 95% CI for interaction, -0.05 to 0.01). Conclusions and Relevance: Although male and female residents receive similar evaluations at the beginning of residency, the rate of milestone attainment throughout training was higher for male than female residents across all EM subcompetencies, leading to a gender gap in evaluations that continues until graduation. Faculty should be cognizant of possible gender bias when evaluating medical trainees.",Comparison of Male vs Female Resident Milestone Evaluations by Faculty During Emergency Medicine Residency Training.
"The HDL receptor scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) plays crucial roles in cholesterol homeostasis, lipoprotein metabolism, and atherosclerosis. Hepatic SR-BI mediates reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) by the uptake of HDL cholesterol for routing to the bile. Through the selective uptake of HDL lipids, hepatic SR-BI modulates HDL composition and preserves HDL's atheroprotective functions of mediating cholesterol efflux and minimizing inflammation and oxidation. Macrophage and endothelial cell SR-BI inhibits the development of atherosclerosis by mediating cholesterol trafficking to minimize atherosclerotic lesion foam cell formation. SR-BI signaling also helps limit inflammation and cell death and mediates efferocytosis of apoptotic cells in atherosclerotic lesions thereby preventing vulnerable plaque formation. SR-BI is emerging as a multifunctional therapeutic target to reduce atherosclerosis development.",SR-BI: A Multifunctional Receptor in Cholesterol Homeostasis and Atherosclerosis.
"OBJECTIVES: Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is the most established indicator of the quality of screening colonoscopy. The effect of gastroenterology (GI) fellows on the quality of screening colonoscopies has been evaluated previously; however, the effect of starting a new GI fellowship program on the quality of screening colonoscopies has not been studied. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of starting a GI fellowship program and the participation of fellows in screening colonoscopies on ADR and other measures of quality. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study of all screening colonoscopies performed 20 months before and 20 months after starting the GI fellowship at our medical center (November 2010-February 2014). Colonoscopy procedure notes and pathology records were reviewed for each patient. Data from the two periods were compared using either the Fisher exact test or the two-sample t test. RESULTS: A total of 2127 complete colonoscopies were included in the analysis. The mean age of patients was 58.8 +/- 6.6 years. Of the 2127 colonoscopies, GI fellows were involved in 385 (18%), whereas 1742 (82%) were performed solely by GI attendings (attending physicians). Multivariate analysis using relative risk (RR) of regression was done. The after starting the GI fellowship period was significantly associated with an increase in ADR (RR 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.30, P < 0.001) and advanced adenoma detection rate (RR 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.38, P < 0.001) compared with the before starting the GI fellowship period. In the after starting the GI fellowship period, the polyp detection rate and ADR for colonoscopies performed by the attending physicians with the fellows were significantly higher than colonoscopies performed solely by the same attendings (58.4% vs 44.5%, P = 0.001, 42.0% vs 32.9%, P = 0.017, respectively).

"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the initial application of a recently published three-step framework for implementing trauma-informed care (TIC) in a pediatric health care network by applying Framework for Spread. METHODS: In steps 1 and 2 of the framework, we established commitment from the health care network leadership and initial interest in TIC among clinical providers (step 1), set evidence-based training goals and created the associated TIC training content (step 2). In step 3, 440 health care professionals (from 27 health care teams) participated in single-session, 1-hour training that covered the psychological impact of injury- and illness-related trauma, identification of traumatic stress symptoms, and how to respond to children exposed to potentially traumatic events. A concomitant quality improvement project allowed us to assess potential changes in training participants' favorable attitudes toward the integration of TIC and confidence in delivering TIC. RESULTS: Compared with pretraining, participants demonstrated increases in attitude toward TIC, t(293) = 5.8, P < .001, Cohen's d = 0.32, and confidence in delivering TIC, t(293) = 20.9, P < .001, Cohen's d = 1.09. DISCUSSION: Trainings were effective in achieving proximal goals targeting attitudes and confidence, thereby demonstrating the feasibility and clinical relevance of TIC training when implemented according to the three-step framework. Future research should examine methods of training to reach wide audiences to promote systematic change and evaluate changes in patient outcomes associated with providers' implementation of TIC.",Application of a Framework to Implement Trauma-Informed Care Throughout a Pediatric Health Care Network.
"BACKGROUND: Mothers whose infants are born with complex congenital heart disease (CCHD) experience stress during their infant's hospitalization in a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU). OBJECTIVES: This study addressed 2 research questions: (1) What are the parental stressors for mothers whose infants with CCHD are in the PCICU? And (2) What are the relationships of trait anxiety and 3 parental stressors to the parental stress response of state anxiety in mothers whose infants with CCHD are in the PCICU? METHODS: This descriptive correlational study included 62 biological mothers of infants admitted to a PCICU within 1 month of birth who had undergone cardiac surgery for CCHD. Maternal and infant demographics and responses to the Parental Stressor Scale: Infant Hospitalization and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were collected at 3 major PCICUs across the United States. RESULTS: Mothers' scores revealed that infant appearance and behavior was the greatest stressor, followed by parental role alteration, then sights and sounds. The combination of trait anxiety and parental role alteration explained 26% of the variance in maternal state anxiety. Mothers with other children at home had significantly higher state anxiety than did mothers with only the hospitalized infant. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study revealed factors that contribute to the stress of mothers whose infants are born with CCHD and are hospitalized in a PCICU. Nurses are in a critical position to provide education and influence care to reduce maternal stressors in the PCICU, enhance mothers' parental role, and mitigate maternal state anxiety.",Maternal Stress and Anxiety in the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.
"RATIONALE: The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is underexpressed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung, but the role of RAGE in human lung fibrosis remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) the association between IPF risk and variation at rs2070600, a functional missense variant in AGER (the gene that codes for RAGE), and (2) the associations between plasma-soluble RAGE (sRAGE) levels with disease severity and time to death or lung transplant in IPF. METHODS: We genotyped the rs2070600 single-nucleotide polymorphism in 108 adults with IPF and 324 race-/ethnicity-matched control subjects. We measured plasma sRAGE by ELISA in 103 adults with IPF. We used generalized linear and additive models as well as Cox models to control for potential confounders. We repeated our analyses in 168 (genetic analyses) and 177 (sRAGE analyses) adults with other forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD). RESULTS: There was no association between rs2070600 variation among adults with IPF (P = 0.31). Plasma sRAGE levels were lower among adults with IPF and other forms of ILD than in control subjects (P < 0.001). The rs2070600 allele A was associated with a 49% lower sRAGE level (95% confidence interval [CI], 11 to 71%; P = 0.02) among adults with IPF. In adjusted analyses, lower sRAGE levels were associated with greater disease severity (14% sRAGE decrement per 10% FVC decrement; 95% CI, 5 to 22%) and a higher rate of death or lung transplant at 1 year (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.9 per logarithmic unit of sRAGE decrement; 95% CI, 1.2-3.3) in IPF. Similar findings were observed in a heterogeneous group of adults with other forms of ILD. CONCLUSIONS: Lower plasma sRAGE levels may be a biological measure of disease severity in IPF. Variation at the rs2070600 single-nucleotide polymorphism was not associated with IPF risk.",Plasma Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
"BACKGROUND: Distal radius fractures are the most common injury in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study was to determine the variation among pediatric orthopaedic surgeons when diagnosing and treating distal radius fractures. METHODS: Nine pediatric orthopaedic surgeons reviewed 100 sets of wrist radiographs and were asked to describe the fracture, prescribe the type of treatment and length of immobilization, and determine the next follow-up visit. kappa statistics were performed to assess the agreement with the chance agreement removed. RESULTS: Only fair agreement was present when diagnosing and classifying the distal radius fractures (kappa=0.379). There was poor agreement regarding the type of treatment that would be recommended (kappa=0.059). There was no agreement regarding the length of immobilization (kappa=-0.004).Poor agreement was also present regarding when the first follow-up visit should occur (kappa=0.088), whether or not new radiographs should be obtained at the first follow-up visit (kappa=0.133), and if radiographs were necessary at the final follow-up visit (kappa=0.163). Surgeons had fair agreement regarding stability of the fracture (kappa=0.320).A subgroup analysis comparing various traits of the treatment immobilization showed providers only had a slight level of agreement on whether splint or cast immobilization should be used (kappa=0.072). There was poor agreement regarding whether long-arm or short-arm immobilization should be prescribed (kappa=-0.067).Twenty-three of the 100 radiographs were diagnosed as a torus/buckle fracture by all 9 surgeons. kappa analysis performed on all the treatment and management questions showed that each query had poor agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The interobserver reliability of diagnosing pediatric distal radius fractures showed only fair agreement. This study demonstrates that there is no standardization regarding how to treat these fractures and the length of immobilization required for proper fracture healing. Better classification systems of distal radius fractures are needed that standardize the treatment of these injuries.

"OBJECTIVE: Prefrail and frail older adults are a heterogeneous population. The measurement of appendicular lean mass (ALM) may distinguish those at higher versus lower risk of poor outcomes. We examined the relationship between ALM and mortality among prefrail and frail older adults. DESIGN: This was a population-based cohort study. SETTING: The Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III; 1988-1994). PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (age >/=65 years) with pre-frailty or frailty defined using the Fried criteria. MEASUREMENTS: ALM was quantified using bioimpedance analysis. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis examined the relationship between ALM and mortality. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine if ALM added to age and sex improved the predictive discrimination of five-year and ten-year mortality. RESULTS: At baseline, the average age was 74.9 years, 66.7% were female, 86.3% and 13.7% were prefrail and frail, respectively. The mean ALM was 18.9 kg [standard deviation (SD): 5.5]. During a median 8.9 years of follow-up, 1,307 of 1,487 study participants died (87.9%). Higher ALM was associated with a lower risk of mortality. In a multivariable-adjusted regression model that accounted for demographic, behavioral, clinical, physical function, and frailty characteristics, each SD increase in ALM was associated with an 50% lower risk of mortality [Hazard Ratio: 0.50 (95% CI: 0.27-0.92); P=0.026]. The addition of ALM to age and sex improved the predictive discrimination of five-year (P=0.027) and ten-year (P=0.016) mortality. CONCLUSION: ALM distinguishes the risk of mortality among prefrail and frail older adults. Additional research examining ALM as a therapeutic target is warranted.",Appendicular Lean Mass and Mortality among Prefrail and Frail Older Adults.
"High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a versatile protein with nuclear and extracellular functions. In the extracellular milieu, HMGB1 binds to several receptors, notably the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). The expressions of HMGB1 and RAGE have been described in a variety of cancers. However, the clinical values of HMGB1 and RAGE in haematological malignancies have yet to be evaluated. A systematic search through PubMed and the Web of Science for articles discussing the role of HMGB1 and RAGE in haematological malignancies produced 15 articles. Overexpression of HMGB1 was reported to be associated with malignancy and, in certain studies, poor prognosis and tumour aggressiveness. Only one included study investigated the clinical value of RAGE, in which no significant difference was found between expression of RAGE in CLL neoplastic cells and nonmalignant controls. The discussed associations of HMGB1 and RAGE with clinicopathological characteristics of patients with haematological malignancies warrants further investigation into the prognostic and diagnostic value of both of these molecules.",Association of high mobility group BOX-1 and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts with clinicopathological features of haematological malignancies: a systematic review.
"INTRODUCTION: Although the Diabetes Prevention Program and other clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of intensive lifestyle interventions (ILI) and metformin to prevent type 2 diabetes, no studies have tested their comparative effects in pragmatic settings. This study was designed to compare the real-world effectiveness of ILI, metformin, and standard care among Hispanic women (Latinas) with prediabetes. STUDY DESIGN: RCT. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-two Latinas, who had a mean hemoglobin A1c of 5.9%, BMI of 33.3 kg/m(2), and waist circumference of 97.4 cm (38.3 inches), were recruited from an urban community and randomly assigned to ILI, metformin, or standard care using 1:1:1 allocation. Data were collected from 2013-2015 and analyzed in 2016. INTERVENTION: The 12-month ILI was adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program's ILI and delivered by community health workers (promotoras) over 24 sessions. Metformin participants received 850 mg twice daily. Those randomized to standard care continued their regular medical care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight and secondary outcomes (waist circumference, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and lipids) were assessed at baseline and 12 months. RESULTS: ILI participants demonstrated significantly greater mean weight loss (-4.0 kg, 5.0%) than metformin (-0.9 kg, 1.1%) and standard care participants (+0.8 kg, 0.9%) (p<0.001). The difference in weight loss between metformin and standard care was not significant. The ILI group experienced a greater reduction in waist circumference than standard care (p=0.001), and a marginal improvement in hemoglobin A1c compared with metformin and standard care (p=0.063). CONCLUSIONS: In the first comparative effectiveness trial of diabetes prevention treatments, a 12-month ILI produced significantly greater weight loss than metformin and standard care among Latinas with prediabetes. These data suggest that ILI delivered by promotoras is an effective strategy for preventing diabetes in this high-risk group, which may be superior to metformin. Future pragmatic trials involving larger samples should examine differences in diabetes incidence associated with these treatments.",PREVENT-DM Comparative Effectiveness Trial of Lifestyle Intervention and Metformin.

"OBJECTIVES: Determine the accuracy and confidence of critical care medicine providers to identify seizures using amplitude-integrated electroencephalography versus amplitude-integrated electroencephalography combined with color density spectral array electroencephalography (aEEG + CDSA). DESIGN: Tutorial and questionnaire. SETTING: PICU. SUBJECTS: Pediatric critical care providers (attendings, fellows, and nurses). INTERVENTIONS: A standardized powerpoint tutorial on amplitude-integrated electroencephalography and color density spectral array followed by classification of 100 amplitude-integrated electroencephalography images and 100 amplitude-integrated electroencephalography combined with color density spectral array as displaying seizures or not displaying seizures. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Electroencephalography tracings were obtained from children monitored with continuous electroencephalography after cardiac arrest. The gold standard for seizure identification was continuous electroencephalography interpretation by a pediatric electroencephalographer. The same electroencephalography tracings were used to generate images containing only amplitude-integrated electroencephalography or aEEG + CDSA. Twenty-three critical care medicine providers underwent a 30-minute tutorial on amplitude-integrated electroencephalography and color density spectral array interpretation. They were then asked to determine if there were seizures on 100 amplitude-integrated electroencephalography images and 100 aEEG + CDSA. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography seizure detection sensitivity was 77% (95% CI, 73%-80%), specificity of 65% (95% CI, 62%-67%), negative predictive value of 88% (95% CI, 86%-90%), and positive predictive value of 46% (95% CI, 43%-49%). For aEEG + CDSA, sensitivity was 77% (95% CI, 74%-81%), specificity of 68% (95% CI, 66%-71%), negative predictive value of 89% (95% CI, 87%-90%), and positive predictive value of 49% (95% CI, 46%-52%). Sensitivity for status epilepticus detection was 77% (95% CI, 71%-82%) with amplitude-integrated electroencephalography and 75% (95% CI, 69%-81%) with aEEG + CDSA. The addition of color density spectral array to amplitude-integrated electroencephalography did not improve seizure detection. However, 87% of critical care medicine providers qualitatively felt that combining both modalities increased their ability to detect seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography and aEEG + CDSA offer reasonable sensitivity and negative predictive value for seizure detection by critical care medicine providers. aEEG + CDSA did not improve seizure detection over amplitude-integrated electroencephalography alone although critical care medicine providers felt more confident using both tools combined. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography and color density spectral array require further evaluation as a tool for screening for seizures and should only be used in conjunction with professional continuous electroencephalography review.",Seizure Detection by Critical Care Providers Using Amplitude-Integrated Electroencephalography and Color Density Spectral Array in Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Patients.
"CD47, a broadly expressed cell surface protein, inhibits cell phagocytosis via interaction with phagocyte-expressed SIRPalpha. A variety of hematological malignancies demonstrate elevated CD47 expression, suggesting that CD47 may mediate immune escape. We discovered three unique CD47-SIRPalpha blocking anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with low nano-molar affinity to human and cynomolgus monkey CD47, and no hemagglutination and platelet aggregation activity. To characterize the anti-cancer activity elicited by blocking CD47, the mAbs were cloned into effector function silent and competent Fc backbones. Effector function competent mAbs demonstrated potent activity in vitro and in vivo, while effector function silent mAbs demonstrated minimal activity, indicating that blocking CD47 only leads to a therapeutic effect in the presence of Fc effector function. A non-human primate study revealed that the effector function competent mAb IgG1 C47B222-(CHO) decreased red blood cells (RBC), hematocrit and hemoglobin by >40% at 1 mg/kg, whereas the effector function silent mAb IgG2sigma C47B222-(CHO) had minimal impact on RBC indices at 1 and 10 mg/kg. Taken together, our findings suggest that targeting CD47 is an attractive therapeutic anti-cancer approach. However, the anti-cancer activity observed with anti-CD47 mAbs is Fc effector dependent as are the side effects observed on RBC indices.",Anti-leukemic activity and tolerability of anti-human CD47 monoclonal antibodies.
"CONTEXT: - Numerous feasibility studies to type human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) by next-generation sequencing (NGS) have led to the development of vendor-supported kits for HLA typing by NGS. Some clinical laboratories have introduced HLA-NGS, and many are investigating the introduction. Standards from accrediting agencies form the regulatory framework for introducing this test into clinical laboratories. OBJECTIVES: - To provide an assessment of metrics and considerations relevant to the successful implementation of clinical HLA-NGS typing, and to provide as a reference a validated HLA-NGS protocol used clinically since December 2013 at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). DATA SOURCES: - The HLA-NGS has been performed on 2532 samples. The initial 1046 and all homozygous samples were also typed by an alternate method. The HLA-NGS demonstrated 99.7% concordance with the alternate method. Ambiguous results were most common at the DPB1 locus because of a lack of phasing between exons 2 and 3 or the unsequenced exon 1 (533 of 2954 alleles; 18.04%) and the DRB1 locus because of not sequencing exon 1 (75 of 3972 alleles; 1.89%). No ambiguities were detected among the other loci. Except for 2 false homozygous samples, all homozygous samples (1891) demonstrated concordance with the alternate method. The article is organized to address the critical elements in the preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic phases of introducing this assay into the clinical laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: - The results demonstrate that HLA typing by NGS is a highly accurate, reproducible, efficient method that provides more-complete sequencing information for the length of the HLA gene and can be the single methodology for HLA typing in clinical immunogenetics laboratories.",Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing for Human Leukocyte Antigen Typing in a Clinical Laboratory: Metrics of Relevance and Considerations for Its Successful Implementation.
"BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that kappa-opioid receptor agonists can reduce hypoxia-ischemia brain injury in animal models. However, it is unclear how the kappa-opioid receptor responds to hypoxia-ischemia. In the current study, the authors used an in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation to explore how kappa-opioid receptors respond to hypoxia and reoxygenation. METHODS: Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells were stably transfected with mouse kappa-opioid receptor-tdTomato fusion protein or Flag-tagged mouse kappa-opioid receptor, divided into several groups (n = 6 to 12), and used to investigate the kappa-opioid receptor movement. Observations were performed under normal oxygen, at 30 min to 1 h after oxygen-glucose deprivation and at 1 h after reoxygenation using high-resolution imaging techniques including immunoelectronmicroscopy in the presence and absence of kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, dynamin inhibitors, potassium channel blockers, and dopamine receptor inhibitor. RESULTS: Hypoxic conditions caused the kappa-opioid receptor to be internalized into the cells. Inhibition of dynamin by Dyngo-4a prevented the receptor internalization. Interestingly, a specific kappa-opioid receptor antagonist norbinaltorphimine blocked internalization, suggesting the involvement of activation of a specific kappa-opioid receptor. kappa-Opioid receptor internalization appears to be reversed by reoxygenation. Quantities of intracellular kappa-opioid receptor-associated gold particles as demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy were increased from 37 to 85% (P < 0.01) after oxygen-glucose deprivation. Potassium channel blockers and dopamine receptor inhibitor failed to block hypoxia-induced kappa-opioid receptor internalization. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia induces reversible kappa-opioid receptor internalization, which was inhibited by selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonists or dynamin inhibitor, and can be reversed by reoxygenation in neuroblastoma cells, indicating the modulating effects between kappa-opioid receptor and hypoxia via kappa-opioid receptor activation and the dynamin-dependent mechanism.",Hypoxia Induces Internalization of kappa-Opioid Receptor.
"BACKGROUND: Patients with an external ventricular drain (EVD) may not be readily mobilized because of concerns of catheter dislodgment and/or inappropriate cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Delayed mobilization may result in longer hospital stays and an increased risk for complications related to immobility. We aimed to determine the safety, feasibility, and outcome of an EVD mobilization protocol in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: A multidisciplinary group developed a formal algorithm for the mobilization of patients with SAH with EVDs. Outcome measures included intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), day to first mobilization, and discharge disposition. Patients were prospectively enrolled during a 12-month period and compared with a historical control group of patients with SAH for the preceding 12-month period. RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 45 (86.7%) patients were women. Mean age did not differ significantly between the preintervention (n = 19) and postintervention (n = 26) groups (59.6 vs 55.7). Number of EVD device days did not differ significantly between groups (16.3 vs 15, P = .422]. Of 101 attempted postintervention mobilization sessions, six were aborted for increased lethargy (1), pain (1), elevated intracranial pressure (1), drain malfunction (1), and hypotension (2). Twenty-four sessions were attempted but never initiated because of worsening neurologic examination (10), pulmonary instability (2), hemodynamic instability (2), medical instability (3), and provider request (1). No patient experienced catheter dislodgment. Mean ICU LOS was not different between groups (20.7 vs 18.2, P = .262). The day of first mobilization was significantly earlier in the postintervention group (18.7 vs 6.5, P < .0001). The percentage of patients discharged home or to acute rehabilitation was higher in the postintervention group (63.2% vs 88.5%, P = .018], when accounting for Hunt and Hess grade. CONCLUSIONS: The mobilization of patients with EVDs is safe and feasible; it may be associated with earlier mobilization, reduced ICU LOS, and better discharge disposition. No major complications were attributable to early mobilization.",Implementation of an Early Mobility Pathway in Neurointensive Care Unit Patients With External Ventricular Devices.
"Despite the success of vaccines in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases, many infectious diseases, both newly emerging and well known, lack vaccines.

"BACKGROUND: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with very high risk sarcomas have poor outcomes and are in need of novel therapies. PROCEDURE: From January 2005 to February 2016, we retrospectively identified all AYA patients with relapsed or metastatic high-grade sarcomas, who were treated with at least one cycle of docetaxel (T), bevacizumab (A), and gemcitabine (G) (TAG ; T = 100 mg/m(2) Day 8, A = 15 mg/kg Day 1, G = 1,000 mg/m(2) Days 1 and 8). RESULTS: Fourteen patients, median age of 20 (15-30), received a total of 80 cycles of TAG, and were followed for a median of 83 months. Diagnosis included osteosarcoma (OST; 8), Ewing sarcoma (3), and soft tissue sarcoma (3). Five of 14 patients achieved clinical remission (CR), 3 had partial responses (PR), 3 had stable disease (SD), and 3 had progressive disease (PD). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 7 and 19 months, respectively. The objective response rate (CR + PR) and tumor control rate (CR + PR + SD) were 57% and 79%, respectively, with two patients alive after 5 years; toxicities included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and capillary leak syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Our study builds on previous studies utilizing TAG in adult leiomyosarcoma (LMS) by focusing on AYA, non-LMS sarcomas, especially OST. Our experience suggests that TAG is well tolerated and has activity in very high risk sarcomas in AYA.","Docetaxel, bevacizumab, and gemcitabine for very high risk sarcomas in adolescents and young adults: A single-center experience."
"Paternal environmental perturbations including exposure to drugs of abuse can produce profound effects on the physiology and behavior of offspring via epigenetic modifications. Here we show that adult drug-naive male offspring of cocaine-exposed sires have memory formation deficits and associated reductions in NMDA receptor-mediated hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Reduced levels of the endogenous NMDA receptor co-agonist d-serine were accompanied by increased expression of the d-serine degrading enzyme d-amino acid oxidase (Dao1) in the hippocampus of cocaine-sired male progeny. Increased Dao1 transcription was associated with enrichment of permissive epigenetic marks on histone proteins in the hippocampus of male cocaine-sired progeny, some of which were enhanced near the Dao1 locus. Finally, hippocampal administration of d-serine reversed both the memory formation and synaptic plasticity deficits. Collectively, these results demonstrate that paternal cocaine exposure produces epigenetic remodeling in the hippocampus leading to NMDA receptor-dependent memory formation and synaptic plasticity impairments only in male progeny, which has significant implications for the male descendants of chronic cocaine users.",Paternal cocaine taking elicits epigenetic remodeling and memory deficits in male progeny.
"Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare disorder characterized by discrete episodes of hypersomnia associated with cognitive and behavioural abnormalities, as well as normal alertness and function between episodes. The prevalence of KLS may be underestimated as it is often misdiagnosed and managed as another sleep disorder, neurological disorder or psychiatric condition. KLS is more typically seen in adolescence than at other ages, and is more common in males than in females. There are currently neither standard biomarkers nor specific imaging study findings, making the diagnosis of KLS a challenge. Furthermore, there are no consistently effective therapies. The prognosis, however, is felt to be overall favorable, as episodes become progressively milder and less frequent before resolving entirely in most patients.",Kleine-Levin Syndrome.

"BACKGROUND: The role of the operating room (OR) environment has been thought to contribute to surgical site infection rates. The quality of OR air, disruption of airflow, and other factors may increase contamination risks. We measured air particulate counts (APCs) to determine if they increased in relation to traffic, door opening, and other common activities. METHODS: During 1 week, we recorded APCs in 5-minute intervals and movement of health care workers. Trained observers recorded information about traffic, door openings, job title of the opener, and the reason for opening. RESULTS: At least 1 OR door was open during 47% of all readings. There were 13.4 door openings per hour during cases. Door opening rates ranged from 0.19-0.28 per minute. During this time, a total of 660 air measurements were obtained. The mean APCs were 9,238 particles (95% confidence interval [CI], 5,494- 12,982) at baseline and 14,292 particles (95% CI, 12,382-16,201) during surgery. Overall APCs increased 13% when either door was opened (P < .15). Larger particles that correlated to bacterial size were elevated significantly (P < .001) on door opening. CONCLUSIONS: We observed numerous instances of verbal communication and equipment movement. Improving efficiency of communication and equipment can aid in reduction of traffic. Further study is needed to examine links between microbiologic sampling, outcome data, and particulate matter to enable study of risk factors and effects of personnel movement.",Assessment of operating room airflow using air particle counts and direct observation of door openings.

"The authors present a new technique for reconstruction of large curvilinear mandibular defects with distraction osteogenesis and early open callus manipulation. In phase 1, transport disks are created from mandibular bone and distracted across the entire length of the defect, without the restriction from a mandible plate fixation. This allows for full-length distraction until enough regenerate is obtained to reconstruct the defect without the need for additional bone grafts. Taking advantage of the soft moldable regenerate, the second and final operative procedure allows for the manipulation, repositioning, and fixation of the transported segments in the ideal position creating perfect tridimensional form and symmetry of the mandible arch. In addition, the consolidation phase is shortened by the early removal of distractors, substantially reducing the total length of treatment. This article describes 2 clinical cases treated according to this technique, one with a 6-cm mandibular defect where a sagittal plane manipulation was performed, and the other with a 7-cm defect and axial plane manipulation. Five years postsurgery, both patients had achieved full stable reconstruction without the need for bone grafting, and had obtained good facial symmetry, with no recorded complications. This technique serves to establish bone transport as a valuable alternative to bone free flaps in the reconstruction of large curvilinear segmental mandibular defects.",Curvilinear Segmental Mandibular Reconstruction Utilizing Distraction Osteogenesis and Early Open Callus Manipulation.
"Heteromeric nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) were thought to have two orthodox agonist-binding sites at two alpha/beta subunit interfaces. Highly selective ligands are hard to develop by targeting orthodox agonist sites because of high sequence similarity of this binding pocket among different subunits. Recently, unorthodox ACh-binding sites have been discovered at some alpha/alpha and beta/alpha subunit interfaces, such as alpha4/alpha4, alpha5/alpha4 and beta3/alpha4. Targeting unorthodox sites may yield subtype-selective ligands, such as those for (alpha4beta2)2 alpha5, (alpha4beta2)2 beta3 and (alpha6beta2)2 beta3 nAChRs. The unorthodox sites have unique pharmacology. Agonist binding at one unorthodox site is not sufficient to activate nAChRs, but it increases activation from the orthodox sites. NS9283, a selective agonist for the unorthodox alpha4/alpha4 site, was initially thought to be a positive allosteric modulator (PAM). NS9283 activates nAChRs with three engineered alpha4/alpha4 sites. PAMs, on the other hand, act at allosteric sites where ACh cannot bind. Known PAM sites include the ACh-homologous non-canonical site (e.g. morantel at beta/alpha), the C-terminus (e.g. Br-PBTC and 17beta-estradiol), a transmembrane domain (e.g. LY2087101) or extracellular and transmembrane domain interfaces (e.g. NS206). Some of these PAMs, such as Br-PBTC and 17beta-estradiol, require only one subunit to potentiate activation of nAChRs. In this review, we will discuss differences between activation from orthosteric and allosteric sites, their selective ligands and clinical implications. These studies have advanced understanding of the structure, assembly and pharmacology of heteromeric neuronal nAChRs.

"Deficiency in cerebral amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) clearance is implicated in the pathogenesis of the common late-onset forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulation of misfolded Abeta in the brain is believed to be a net result of imbalance between its production and removal. This in turn may trigger neuroinflammation, progressive synaptic loss, and ultimately cognitive decline. Clearance of cerebral Abeta is a complex process mediated by various systems and cell types, including vascular transport across the blood-brain barrier, glymphatic drainage, and engulfment and degradation by resident microglia and infiltrating innate immune cells. Recent studies have highlighted a new, unexpected role for peripheral monocytes and macrophages in restricting cerebral Abeta fibrils, and possibly soluble oligomers. In AD transgenic (ADtg) mice, monocyte ablation or inhibition of their migration into the brain exacerbated Abeta pathology, while blood enrichment with monocytes and their increased recruitment to plaque lesion sites greatly diminished Abeta burden. Profound neuroprotective effects in ADtg mice were further achieved through increased cerebral recruitment of myelomonocytes overexpressing Abeta-degrading enzymes. This review summarizes the literature on cellular and molecular mechanisms of cerebral Abeta clearance with an emphasis on the role of peripheral monocytes and macrophages in Abeta removal.",Clearance of cerebral Abeta in Alzheimer's disease: reassessing the role of microglia and monocytes.
"Importance: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is a common and distressing adverse effect. In previous studies of scalp cooling to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia, conclusions have been limited. Objectives: To evaluate whether use of a scalp cooling system is associated with a lower amount of hair loss among women receiving specific chemotherapy regimens for early-stage breast cancer and to assess related changes in quality of life. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study conducted at 5 US medical centers of women with stage I or II breast cancer receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens excluding sequential or combination anthracycline and taxane (106 patients in the scalp cooling group and 16 in the control group; 14 matched by both age and chemotherapy regimen). The study was conducted between August 2013 and October 2014 with ongoing annual follow-up for 5 years. Exposures: Use of a scalp cooling system. Scalp cooling was initiated 30 minutes prior to each chemotherapy cycle, with scalp temperature maintained at 3 degrees C (37 degrees F) throughout chemotherapy and for 90 minutes to 120 minutes afterward. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-estimated hair loss using the Dean scale was assessed 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy by unblinded patient review of 5 photographs. A Dean scale score of 0 to 2 (</=50% hair loss) was defined as treatment success. A positive association between scalp cooling and reduced risk of hair loss would be demonstrated if 50% or more of patients in the scalp cooling group achieved treatment success, with the lower bound of the 95% CI greater than 40% of the success proportion. Quality of life was assessed at baseline, at the start of the last chemotherapy cycle, and 1 month later. Median follow-up was 29.5 months. Results: Among the 122 patients in the study, the mean age was 53 years (range, 28-77 years); 77.0% were white, 9.0% were black, and 10.7% were Asian; and the mean duration of chemotherapy was 2.3 months (median, 2.1 months). No participants in the scalp cooling group received anthracyclines. Hair loss of 50% or less (Dean score of 0-2) was seen in 67 of 101 patients (66.3%; 95% CI, 56.2%-75.4%) evaluable for alopecia in the scalp cooling group vs 0 of 16 patients (0%) in the control group (P < .001). Three of 5 quality-of-life measures were significantly better 1 month after the end of chemotherapy in the scalp cooling group. Of patients who underwent scalp cooling, 27.3% (95% CI, 18.0%-36.6%) reported feeling less physically attractive compared with 56.3% (95% CI, 31.9%-80.6%) of patients in the control group (P = .02). Of the 106 patients in the scalp cooling group, 4 (3.8%) experienced the adverse event of mild headache and 3 (2.8%) discontinued scalp cooling due to feeling cold. Conclusions and Relevance: Among women undergoing non-anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer, the use of scalp cooling vs no scalp cooling was associated with less hair loss at 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy. Further research is needed to assess outcomes after patients receive anthracycline regimens, longer-term measures of alopecia, and adverse effects.

"Reconstruction options in children after bone tumor resection are as varied as they are challenging. Advances in biologic and endoprosthetic design have led to many choices, all of which must be considered in the context of prognosis, treatment limitations, and patient/family expectations. The current experience and results of limb-sparing surgery following bone sarcoma resection in growing children are discussed, including allograft, autograft, and metallic prostheses alone and in combination, especially as they pertain to the knee. In some cases, the ablative options of amputation and rotationplasty must be seen as equal and, at times, superior choices to limb salvage.",Reconstruction Following Tumor Resections in Skeletally Immature Patients.
"Coagulopathy is common in intensive care units (ICUs). Many physiologic derangements lead to dysfunctional hemostasis; these may be either congenital or acquired. The most devastating outcome of coagulopathy in the critically ill is major bleeding, defined by transfusion requirement, hemodynamic instability, or intracranial hemorrhage. ICU coagulopathy often poses complex management dilemmas, as bleeding risk must be tempered with thrombotic potential. Coagulopathy associated with intracranial hemorrhage bears directly on prognosis and outcome. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence for the management of coagulopathies in neurocritical care; however, data derived from studies of patients with intraparenchymal hemorrhage may inform treatment decisions. Coagulopathy is often broadly defined as any derangement of hemostasis resulting in either excessive bleeding or clotting, although most typically it is defined as impaired clot formation. Abnormalities in coagulation testing without overt clinical bleeding may also be considered evidence of coagulopathy. This chapter will focus on acquired conditions, such as organ failure, pharmacologic therapies, and platelet dysfunction that are associated with defective clot formation and result in, or exacerbate, intracranial hemorrhage, specifically spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury.",Management of neurologic complications of coagulopathies.

"Barrett's esophagus is a well-recognized risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. The natural history of Barrett's esophagus classified as 'indefinite for dysplasia' (IND) is poorly characterized. The aim of this study is to characterize the natural history of IND by determining the rate of neoplastic progression and identifying risk factors for progression. Patients from the University of Pennsylvania Health System pathology database and Barrett's esophagus registry with a diagnosis of IND between 2000 and 2014 were identified. Exclusion criteria included: (1) prior diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC); (2) presence of LGD, HGD, or EAC at the time of diagnosis of IND; and (3) lack of follow-up endoscopy after diagnosis. Patients with neoplastic progression were classified as having either prevalent disease (LGD, HGD, or EAC on surveillance biopsy within 12 months of IND diagnosis) or incident disease (LGD, HGD, or EAC on surveillance biopsy >12 months after IND diagnosis). One hundred six patients were eligible for analysis. Of 87 patients with follow-up endoscopy and biopsies within 1 year of IND diagnosis, 7 (8%) had prevalent disease (2 LGD, 4 HGD, 1 EAC). The prevalence of LGD was 2.3%, HGD was 4.6%, and EAC was 1.1%. Importantly, four of the seven prevalent (2 LGD, 2 HGD) cases were found to have dysplasia within 6 months of IND diagnosis. No demographic or endoscopic characteristics studied were associated with prevalent disease. Of the 106 IND patients, there were 66 patients without prevalent dysplasia with >1-year follow-up. Three (4.5%) progressed (1 to LGD after 12 months, 2 to HGD after 16.5 and 28 months), yielding an incidence rate for any dysplasia of 1.4 cases/100 person-years and HGD/EAC of 0.9/100 person-years. Risk factors for incident disease were smoking (p = 0.02) and Barrett's esophagus segment length (p = 0.03). IND is associated with considerable risk of prevalent dysplasia, especially within the first 6 months after diagnosis. However, the incidence of HGD/EAC is low and similar to previous studies of IND. These data suggest that IND patients should have repeat endoscopy within 6 months with careful surveillance protocols. Longer BE length and smoking history may help predict which patients are more likely to develop dysplasia, and therefore identify patients who may warrant even closer monitoring.",Risk of malignant progression in Barrett's esophagus indefinite for dysplasia.
"Neonatal pain and stress induce long-term changes in pain sensitivity and behavior. Previously we found alterations in pain sensitivity in adolescent rats exposed to early-life adverse events. We tested whether these alterations have long-lasting effects and if those effects can be improved by the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist buspirone injected chronically during the adolescent period. This study investigates: (1) effects of inflammatory pain (the injection of formalin into the pad of a hind paw) or stress (short maternal deprivation-isolation, MI), or their combination in 1-2-day-old rats on the adult basal pain, formalin-induced pain, anxiety and depression; (2) effects of adolescent buspirone in adult rats that experienced similar early-life insults. Changes in nociceptive thresholds were evaluated using the hot plate (HP) and formalin tests; levels of anxiety and depression were assessed with the elevated plus maze and forced swim tests respectively. Both neonatal painful and stressful treatments induced long-term alterations in the forced swim test. Other changes in adult behavioral responses were dependent on the type of neonatal treatment. There was a notable lack of long-term effects of the combination of early inflammatory pain and stress of MI on the pain responses, anxiety levels or on the effects of adolescent buspirone. This study provides the first evidence that chronic injection of buspirone in adolescent rats alters antinociceptive and anxiolytic effects limited to adult rats that showed behavioral alterations induced by early-life adverse treatments. These data highlight the role of 5-HT1A receptors in long-term effects of neonatal inflammatory pain and stress of short MI on adaptive behavior and possibility of correction of the pain and psychoemotional behavior that were altered by adverse pain/stress intervention using buspirone during critical adolescent period.",Long-Term Effects of Chronic Buspirone during Adolescence Reduce the Adverse Influences of Neonatal Inflammatory Pain and Stress on Adaptive Behavior in Adult Male Rats.
"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome that emerges in childhood or early adolescence and persists into adulthood for a majority of individuals. There are many other adults with ADHD who may not seek out evaluation and treatment until adulthood, having been able to ""get by"" before struggling with inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity in adulthood, in addition to facing the associated features of disorganization, poor time management, and procrastination among many others. A lifetime diagnosis of ADHD is associated with a wide range of life impairments, which makes a comprehensive and accurate diagnostic assessment essential in order to obtain appropriate treatment. Moreover, while there are effective medical and psychosocial treatments for ADHD, it is important to be able to track treatment response in order to evaluate whether adjustments in specific interventions are needed or referrals for adjunctive treatments and supports are indicated to facilitate optimal therapeutic outcomes. The goal of this article is to provide a clinically useful review of the various measures that practicing clinicians can use to aid in the diagnostic assessment and monitoring of psychosocial and medical treatment of ADHD in adult patients. This review includes various structured interviews, screening scales, adult ADHD symptom inventories, measures of associated features of ADHD, as well as ratings of impairment and functioning which can be adapted to clinicians' practice needs in order to track treatment progress and optimize treatments for adults with ADHD.",Assessment and monitoring of treatment response in adult ADHD patients: current perspectives.
"Patient groups prone to polypharmacy and special subpopulations are susceptible to suboptimal treatment. Refined dosing in special populations is imperative to improve therapeutic response and/or lowering the risk of toxicity. Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) may improve treatment outcomes by achieving the optimal dose for an individual patient. There is, however, relatively little published evidence of large-scale utility and impact of MIPD, where it is often implemented as local collaborative efforts between academia and healthcare. This article highlights some successful applications of bringing MIPD to clinical care and proposes strategies for wider integration in healthcare. Considerations are brought up herein that will need addressing to see MIPD become ""widespread clinical practice,"" among those, wider interdisciplinary collaborations and the necessity for further evidence-based efficacy and cost-benefit analysis of MIPD in healthcare. The implications of MIPD on regulatory policies and pharmaceutical development are also discussed as part of the roadmap.",Why has model-informed precision dosing not yet become common clinical reality? lessons from the past and a roadmap for the future.
"Immature mucosal defenses contribute to increased susceptibility of newborn infants to pathogens. Sparse knowledge of age-dependent changes in mucosal immunity has hampered improvements in neonatal morbidity because of infections. We report that exposure of neonatal mice to commensal bacteria immediately after birth is required for a robust host defense against bacterial pneumonia, the leading cause of death in newborn infants. This crucial window was characterized by an abrupt influx of interleukin-22 (IL-22)-producing group 3 innate lymphoid cells (IL-22(+)ILC3) into the lungs of newborn mice. This influx was dependent on sensing of commensal bacteria by intestinal mucosal dendritic cells. Disruption of postnatal commensal colonization or selective depletion of dendritic cells interrupted the migratory program of lung IL-22(+)ILC3 and made the newborn mice more susceptible to pneumonia, which was reversed by transfer of commensal bacteria after birth. Thus, the resistance of newborn mice to pneumonia relied on commensal bacteria-directed ILC3 influx into the lungs, which mediated IL-22-dependent host resistance to pneumonia during this developmental window. These data establish that postnatal colonization by intestinal commensal bacteria is pivotal in the development of the lung defenses of newborns.",Intestinal commensal bacteria mediate lung mucosal immunity and promote resistance of newborn mice to infection.
"The term cystic nephroma has traditionally been used to refer to 2 neoplasms, a lesion in adults that is now thought to be part of the spectrum of mixed epithelial stromal tumor (MEST) and a pediatric lesion that has been associated with mutations in the DICER1 gene. A direct detailed morphologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic comparison of these 2 lesions has not been performed. In this study, we compare the morphologic features, immunoreactivity for estrogen receptor and inhibin, and DICER1 genetic status of 12 adult cystic nephroma/MEST (median age 50.5 y, all females) and 7 pediatric cystic nephroma (median age 1.3 y, male:female=6:1). Both lesions (11 of 12 adult cases, 6 of 7 pediatric cases) frequently demonstrated subepithelial accentuation of stromal cellularity, though the increased cellularity frequently included inflammatory cells in the pediatric cases. All adult and pediatric cases labeled for estrogen receptor; however, whereas most (83%) of adult cases labeled for inhibin at least focally, no pediatric case labeled for inhibin. Most adult cases (58%) demonstrated wavy, ropy collagen in association with cellular stroma, whereas this was not found in pediatric cases. 86% of pediatric cases demonstrated DICER1 mutations, whereas only 1 of 10 adult cases demonstrated a DICER1 mutation. In summary, although cellular stroma and estrogen receptor immunoreactivity are commonly present in both adult and pediatric cystic nephroma, ropy collagen and inhibin immunoreactivity are far more common in adult cystic nephroma/MEST, whereas DICER1 mutations are far more prevalent in pediatric cystic nephroma. These results support the current World Health Organization Classification's separation of adult and pediatric cystic nephromas as distinct entities.","Pediatric Cystic Nephroma Is Morphologically, Immunohistochemically, and Genetically Distinct From Adult Cystic Nephroma."
"BACKGROUND: Drug-drug interactions with insulin secretagogues are associated with increased risk of serious hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to systematically screen for drugs that interact with the five most commonly used secretagogues-glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride, repaglinide, and nateglinide-to cause serious hypoglycemia. METHODS: We screened 400 drugs frequently coprescribed with the secretagogues as candidate interacting precipitants. We first predicted the drug-drug interaction potential based on the pharmacokinetics of each secretagogue-precipitant pair. We then performed pharmacoepidemiologic screening for each secretagogue of interest, and for metformin as a negative control, using an administrative claims database and the self-controlled case series design. The overall rate ratios (RRs) and those for four predefined risk periods were estimated using Poisson regression. The RRs were adjusted for multiple estimation using semi-Bayes method, and then adjusted for metformin results to distinguish native effects of the precipitant from a drug-drug interaction. RESULTS: We predicted 34 pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with the secretagogues, nine moderate and 25 weak. There were 140 and 61 secretagogue-precipitant pairs associated with increased rates of serious hypoglycemia before and after the metformin adjustment, respectively. The results from pharmacokinetic prediction correlated poorly with those from pharmacoepidemiologic screening. CONCLUSIONS: The self-controlled case series design has the potential to be widely applicable to screening for drug-drug interactions that lead to adverse outcomes identifiable in healthcare databases. Coupling pharmacokinetic prediction with pharmacoepidemiologic screening did not notably improve the ability to identify drug-drug interactions in this case.",Biomedical Informatics Approaches to Identifying Drug-Drug Interactions: Application to Insulin Secretagogues.
"PURPOSE: The choroid is thought to be relevant to the pathogenesis of nonneovascular age-related macular degeneration, but its role has not yet been fully defined. In this study, we evaluate the relationship between the extent of macular drusen and specific choroidal parameters, including thickness and intensity. METHODS: Spectral domain optical coherence tomography images were collected from two distinct, independent cohorts with nonneovascular age-related macular degeneration: Amish (53 eyes of 34 subjects) and non-Amish (40 eyes from 26 subjects). All spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans were obtained using the Cirrus HD-OCT with a 512 x 128 macular cube (6 x 6 mm) protocol. The Cirrus advanced retinal pigment epithelium analysis tool was used to automatically compute drusen volume within 3 mm (DV3) and 5 mm (DV5) circles centered on the fovea. The inner and outer borders of the choroid were manually segmented, and the mean choroidal thickness and choroidal intensity (i.e., brightness) were calculated. The choroidal intensity was normalized against the vitreous and nerve fiber layer reflectivity. The correlation between DV and these choroidal parameters was assessed using Pearson and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was observed between normalized choroidal intensity and DV5 in the Amish (r = 0.42, P = 0.002) and non-Amish (r = 0.33, P = 0.03) cohorts. Also, DV3 showed a significant positive correlation with normalized choroidal intensity in both the groups (Amish: r = 0.30, P = 0.02; non-Amish: r = 0.32, P = 0.04). Choroidal thickness was negatively correlated with normalized choroidal intensity in both Amish (r = -0.71, P = 0.001) and non-Amish (r = -0.43, P = 0.01) groups. Normalized choroidal intensity was the most significant constant predictor of DV in both the Amish and non-Amish groups. CONCLUSION: Choroidal intensity, but not choroidal thickness, seems to be associated with drusen volume in Amish and non-Amish populations. These observations suggest that choroidal parameters beyond thickness warrant further study in the setting of age-related macular degeneration.",ASSOCIATION OF DRUSEN VOLUME WITH CHOROIDAL PARAMETERS IN NONNEOVASCULAR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION.

"Erythroid function and development is intimately linked to macrophages. The primary function of erythrocytes is oxygen delivery, which is mediated by iron-containing hemoglobin. The major source of this iron is a recycling pathway where macrophages scavenge old and damaged erythrocytes to release iron contained within the heme moiety. Macrophages also promote erythropoiesis by providing a supportive niche in the bone marrow as an integral component of ""erythorblastic islands."" Importantly, inflammation leads to alterations in iron handling by macrophages with significant impact on iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis. The importance of macrophages in erythropoiesis and iron homeostasis is well established and has been extensively reviewed. However, this developmental relationship is not one way, and erythrocytes can also regulate macrophage development and function. Erythrocyte-derived heme can induce the development of iron-recycling macrophages from monocytes, engage pattern recognition receptors to activate macrophages, and act as ligand for specific nuclear receptors to modulate macrophage function. Here, we discuss the role of heme as a signaling molecule impacting macrophage homeostasis. We will review these actions of heme within the framework of our current understanding of the role of micro-environmental factors in macrophage development and function.",The Heme Connection: Linking Erythrocytes and Macrophage Biology.
"Curcumin is a major diarylheptanoid component of Curcuma longa with traditional usage for anxiety and depression. It has been known for the anti-inflammatory, antistress, and neurotropic effects. Here we examined curcumin effect in neural plasticity and cell viability. 60-channel multielectrode array was applied on organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) to monitor the effect of 10 muM curcumin in long-term depression (LTD) through low-frequency stimulation (LFS) to the Schaffer collaterals and commissural pathways. Cell viability was assayed by propidium iodide uptake test in OHSCs. In addition, the influence of oral curcumin administration on rat behavior was assessed with the forced swim test (FST). Finally, protein expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were measured by Western blot in chronically stressed rats. Our results demonstrated that 10 muM curcumin attenuated LTD and reduced cell death. It also recovered the behavior immobility of FST, rescued the attenuated BDNF expression, and inhibited the enhancement of COX-2 expression in stressed animals. These findings indicate that curcumin can enhance postsynaptic electrical reactivity and cell viability in intact neural circuits with antidepressant-like effects, possibly through the upregulation of BDNF and reduction of inflammatory factors in the brain.",Curcumin Alters Neural Plasticity and Viability of Intact Hippocampal Circuits and Attenuates Behavioral Despair and COX-2 Expression in Chronically Stressed Rats.
"PURPOSE: The purpose of this integrative review was to evaluate and synthesize studies that incorporated biological measures and examined their associations with chronic stress and anxiety in adolescents and emerging adults with chronic health conditions. DESIGN: An integrative literature review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement to identify studies published between 2005 and 2015. METHODS: Using key terms, three databases (PubMed/Medline, PsycInfo and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) were searched by a research librarian. Additional publications with relevance to the topic were identified from citing and cited literature. The full text of 61 publications was reviewed. The final group of articles analyzed for this review included 36 peer-reviewed publications and meeting abstracts. FINDINGS: Studies varied considerably in characteristics, theoretical frameworks, phenotypes of interest, and study measures. Few studies evaluated genomic variants; those that did often examined small samples and a limited number of biological factors. CONCLUSIONS: Studies of chronic stress and anxiety in adolescents and emerging adults with chronic health conditions are currently limited in scope and impact. A more comprehensive approach will facilitate translation into practice to improve short- and long-term health outcomes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Precision and genomic healthcare initiatives support the relevance of this work for nurses in all areas of clinical practice. Genomic testing is expanding to include individuals in all age groups, with and without diagnosed conditions. As psychological and behavioral phenotypes may influence self-management outcomes of adolescents and emerging adults with chronic health conditions, further research in this area is warranted.",An Integrative Review of Biological Variants and Chronic Stress in Emerging Adults With Chronic Conditions.
