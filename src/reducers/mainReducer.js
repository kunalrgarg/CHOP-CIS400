Despite widespread medical, legal, and ethical acceptance, ongoing controversies exist with regard to the concept of brain death and the procedures for its determination. Objectives: To determine the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of pediatric patients declared brain dead in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study involved the abstraction of all patient deaths from the Virtual Pediatric Systems national multicenter database between January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2017. All patients who died in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient demographics, preillness developmental status, severity of illness, cause of death, PICU medical and physical length of stay, and organ donation status, as well as comparison between patients who were declared brain dead vs those who sustained cardiovascular or cardiopulmonary death. Results: Of the 15344 patients who died, 3170 (20.7%) were declared brain dead; 1861 of these patients (58.7%) were male, and 1401 (44.2%) were between 2 and 12 years of age. There was a linear association between PICU size and number of patients declared brain dead per year, with an increase of 4.27 patients (95% CI, 3.46-5.08) per 1000-patient increase in discharges (P < .001). The median (interquartile range) of patients declared brain dead per year ranged from 1 (0-3) in smaller PICUs (defined as those with <500 discharges per year) to 10 (7-15) for larger PICUs (those with 2000-4000 discharges per year). The most common causative mechanisms of brain death were hypoxic-ischemic injury owing to cardiac arrest (1672 of 3170 [52.7%]), shock and/or respiratory arrest without cardiac arrest (399 of 3170 [12.6%]), and traumatic brain injury (634 of 3170 [20.0%]). Most patients declared brain dead (681 of 807 [84.4%]) did not have preexisting neurological dysfunction. Patients who were organ donors (1568 of 3144 [49.9%]) remained in the PICU longer after declaration of brain death compared with those who were not donors (median [interquartile range], 29 [6-41] hours vs 4 [1-8] hours; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Brain death occurred in one-fifth of PICU deaths. Most children declared brain dead had no preexisting neurological dysfunction and had an acute hypoxic-ischemic or traumatic brain injury. Brain death determinations are infrequent, even in large PICUs, emphasizing the importance of ongoing education for medical professionals and standardization of protocols to ensure diagnostic accuracy and consistency.","author_ids":["358","359","360","361","362","363","364","365","366","367"],"author_list":["Kirschen, Matthew P","Francoeur, Conall","Murphy, Marie","Traynor, Danielle","Zhang, Bingqing","Mensinger, Janell L","Ichord, Rebecca","Topjian, Alexis","Berg, Robert A","Nishisaki, Akira","Morrison, Wynne"],"date":"2019/03","id":"30882855","mesh_terms":[],"month":"03","title":"Epidemiology of Brain Death in Pediatric Intensive Care Units in the United States.","year":"2019"},{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To understand trends in pediatric cases performed during urology residency including intraresident variability and cases performed relative to required minimums. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case logs of urology residents graduating from 2010 to 2018 were analyzed. Temporal trends in reported pediatric case volume were assessed via ANOVA tests and calculation of compound annual growth rates (CAGRs). Percent differences between the 90th and 10th percentiles of residents were calculated to assess intraresident variability. Reported case volumes were compared with minimum requirements with t tests. RESULTS: 1072 residents from 306 urology residency programs were represented in this study. Minor pediatric cases increased from 2010 to 2018 (105.4 +/- 54 vs 124.6 +/- 65, P=.004, CAGR=2.1%) while major pediatric cases decreased (83.9 +/- 40 vs 60.8 +/- 30, P < .001, CAGR=-3.9%). Orchiopexy (range, 23%-27%), hypospadias (range, 19%-21%), and hydrocele / hernia (range, 15%-19%) were the highest volume case categories. Mean intraresident variability in reported case volumes was 338% for minor pediatric (CAGR=0%) and 382% for major pediatric (CAGR=1.8%). Mean reported case volumes exceeded the minimum requirement for each case category by several fold (P < .001, range, percent difference 232-675%). All urology residents reported minimum pediatric case requirements in 2018. CONCLUSION: Urology residents report more cases than minimum requirements for pediatric urology by several folds. Future research is needed to understand the implications of increasing intraresident case volume variabilities on residency training in pediatric urology.","author_ids":["2623","2624","2625"],"author_list":["Silvestre, Jason","Hernandez, Jade M","Lee, David I"],"date":"2019/02","id":"30759372","mesh_terms":[],"month":"02","title":"Disparities in Pediatric Operative Experience during Urology Residency Training.","year":"2019"},{"abstract":"The original version of this Article contained an error in the author affiliations.

We hypothesized that current and future pediatric urology fellows could benefit from the experiences of recently graduated fellows on navigating the urology job market. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to survey current and recent pediatric urology fellowship graduates about the process of finding their first job. STUDY DESIGN: A Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) online survey was designed and distributed through email to current fellows and 2012-2017 graduates. Results were evaluated using STATA. RESULTS: 153 participants were emailed, and 94 (61%) completed the survey. The plurality of applicants (44%) began the job search at the Spring American Urological Association meeting, 14 months before finishing (Figure). Of those who started 14 months before finishing, 33% wished they started earlier and 61% would have started at the same point. The median number of programs contacted for a position was 3-4 and the median number of programs visited and offers received was two. After the offer, 40% reported having >8 weeks to decide. Less than half (38.5%) hired an attorney for contract negotiation. Of those who hired an attorney, 68% felt it provided benefit. Regarding contract negotiation, 22% did not negotiate and 35% negotiated for salary. Unsurprisingly, 28% of those who took academic jobs thought negotiating for protected research/educational time was most important compared with only 4% of those who took non-academic jobs (P = 0.02). When asked how they learned about the job they accepted: 28% were contacted by the program, 25% cold called the program, 30% accepted where they did residency or fellowship, and 18% learned through society websites. The plurality (50%) thought the number of desirable positions during the process were as they expected. 41% however, thought the number of desirable positions were expectedly or surprisingly low. Regarding quality of life and satisfaction with job/career choice, 98% stated that they would still choose to subspecialize in pediatric urology. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this survey should provide guidance to fellows on how to approach the job search with respect to timing, expectations, contract negotiation, and initial job satisfaction.","author_ids":["3546","3547"],"author_list":["Sack, B S","Yerkes, E B","Van Batavia, J P"],"date":"2019/01","id":"30685112","mesh_terms":["Contracts","Fellowships and Scholarships","Job Application","Negotiating"],"month":"01","title":"Uncharted territory: navigating the pediatric urology job market.","year":"2019"},{"abstract":"In recent years, robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has developed rapidly and become one of the hot topics in clinical research.

METHODS: The NIH database of both submitted and funded NIH applications were queried and crossed with the departmental affiliation of the principal investigator. Research Grants were defined by the following activity codes: R, P, M, S, K, U (excluding UC6), DP1, DP2, DP3, DP4, DP5, D42 and G12. Derived data were further analyzed using information from the Association of American Medical Colleges to determine the relationship between the number of awards and the size of respective teaching and research faculty. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2017, there were a total of 14,676 funded grants across included specialties with total monetary support of $6.002 billion. Of these funded grants, 250 (1.7%) were from EM principal investigators which corresponded to total support of $89,453,635 (1.5% of overall dollars). There was an increase in total support after 2012 in EM, however when compared to the other specialties, EM investigators submitted relatively fewer grants and awarded grants were funded by a wider distribution of NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other select specialties, EM investigators accounted for a small proportion of grants submitted and funded over the past decade. Though findings illustrate promising trends, to foster success, more submitted grant applications are needed from within EM along with systematic approaches to support faculty members in their pursuit of NIH funding.","author_ids":["4979","4980","4981"],"author_list":["Jang, David H","Levy, Phillip D","Shofer, Frances S","Sun, Benjamin","Brown, Jeremy"],"date":"2019/01","id":"30595424","mesh_terms":["Emergency Medicine","National Institutes of Health (U.S.)"],"month":"01","title":"A comparative analysis of National Institutes of Health research support for emergency medicine - 2008 to 2017.","year":"2019"},{"abstract":"The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) involves multiple organ systems with variable phenotypic expression. Genitourinary tract abnormalities have been noted to be present in up to 30-40% of patients. At our institution, an internationally recognized, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary 22q11.2DS care center has been providing care to these children. We sought to report on the incidence of genitourinary tract anomalies in this large cohort and, therefore, retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent a complete evaluation from 1992 to March 2017. We identified all children with any genital or urinary tract anomaly. For all children with a diagnosis of hydronephrosis, the underlying etiology was determined, when possible. Overall, 1,073 of 1,267 children with 22q11.2DS underwent renal evaluations at our institution. Hundered Sixty-Two (15.1%) children had structural abnormalities of their kidneys/urinary tracts. The majority of children with hydronephrosis (63%) had isolated upper tract dilation without any additional diagnoses. Boys were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a genital abnormality than girls (7.7 vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001). Of the 649 boys in the entire cohort, 24 (3.7%) had cryptorchidism and 24 (3.7%) had hypospadias, which was noted to be mild in all except one boy. Overall, findings of hydronephrosis, unilateral renal agenesis, and multicystic dysplastic kidney occur at higher rates than expected in the general population. Given these findings, in addition to routine physical examination, we believe that all patients with 22q11.2DS warrant screening RBUS at time of diagnosis.","author_ids":["5085","5086","5087","1276","5088","5089"],"author_list":["Van Batavia, Jason P","Crowley, Terrence B","Burrows, Evanette","Zackai, Elaine H","Sanna-Cherchi, Simone","McDonald-McGinn, Donna M","Kolon, Thomas F"],"date":"2018/12","id":"30582277","mesh_terms":["DiGeorge Syndrome","DiGeorge Syndrome","Pediatrics","Urology"],"month":"12","title":"Anomalies of the genitourinary tract in children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"Once unimaginable, fertility management is now a nationally established part of cancer care in institutions, from academic centers to community hospitals to private practices.

The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of imaging studies to Medicare reimbursements for highly compensated nonradiologist providers in specialties often performing imaging studies. METHODS: The Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Database was queried for provider information regarding overall reimbursement for providers in anesthesiology, cardiology, emergency medicine, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedic surgery, neurology, and vascular surgery. Information regarding imaging studies reported and payment amounts were extracted for the 25 highest-reimbursed providers. Data were analyzed for relative contribution of imaging payments to overall medical Medicare payments. RESULTS: Significant differences between numbers of imaging studies, types of imaging, and payment amounts were noted based on provider specialty (p < 0.001). Highest-reimbursed cardiologists received the greatest percentage of Medicare payments from imaging (18.3%) followed by vascular surgery (11.6%), obstetrics and gynecology (10.9%), orthopedic surgery (9.6%), emergency medicine (8.7%), neurology (7.8%), and anesthesiology (3.2%) providers. Mean imaging payments amongst highly reimbursed nonradiologists were greatest for cardiology ($578,265), vascular surgery ($363,912), and orthopedic surgery ($113,634). Amongst highly reimbursed specialists, most common nonradiologist imaging payments were from ultrasound (45%) and cardiac nuclear medicine studies (40%). CONCLUSIONS: Nonradiologist performed imaging payments comprised substantial proportions of overall Medicare reimbursement for highly reimbursed physicians in several specialties, especially cardiology, vascular surgery, and orthopedic surgery. Further investigation is needed to better understand the wider economic implications of nonradiologist imaging study performance and self-referral beyond the Medicare population.","author_ids":["2846","6355","6356","6357","6358","4777"],"author_list":["Degnan, Andrew J","Yi, Paul H","Kim, Nathan","Swietlik, John","Huh, Eric","Nguyen, Jie C"],"date":"2018/11","id":"30466795","mesh_terms":[],"month":"11","title":"Diagnostic and Interventional Imaging Services are Significant Sources of Medicare Revenue for Highly Reimbursed Nonradiologist Providers.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in racial, ethnic, and sex representation at US medical schools across 16 specialties: internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, psychiatry, radiology, anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynecology, neurology, family practice, pathology, emergency medicine, orthopedic surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and dermatology. Using a novel, Census-derived statistical measure of diversity, the S-score, we quantified the degree of underrepresentation for racial minority groups and female faculty by rank for assistant, associate, and full professors from 1990-2016. METHODS: This longitudinal study of faculty diversity uses data obtained from the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Roster from US allopathic medical schools. The proportion of professors of racial minority groups and female faculty by rank was compared to the US population based on data from the US Census Bureau. The Roster includes data on 52,939 clinical medical faculty in 1990, and 129,545 in 2016, at the assistant professor level or higher. The primary measure used in this study was the S-score, a measure of representation based on the probability of the observed frequency of faculty from a racial/ethnic group and sex, given the racial and ethnic distribution of the US. Pearson correlations and 95% confidence intervals for S-score with time were used to measure trends. RESULTS: Blacks and Hispanics showed statistically significant trends (p<0.05) towards increasing underrepresentation in most specialties and are more underrepresented in 2016 than in 1990 across all ranks and specialties analyzed, except for Black females in obstetrics & gynecology. White females were also underrepresented in many specialties and in a subset of specialties trended toward greater underrepresentation. CONCLUSIONS: Current efforts to improve faculty diversity are inadequate in generating an academic physician workforce that represents the diversity of the US. More aggressive measures for faculty recruitment, retention, and promotion are necessary to reach equity in academia and healthcare.","author_ids":["6613","6614","6615"],"author_list":["Lett, Lanair Amaad","Orji, Whitney U","Sebro, Ronnie"],"date":"2018/11","id":"30444928","mesh_terms":[],"month":"11","title":"Declining racial and ethnic representation in clinical academic medicine: A longitudinal study of 16 US medical specialties.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"Global health programs in pediatric surgical fields are needed more than ever to ease the global burden of congenital anomalies.

Many neurological and psychiatric conditions affect both humans and animals. A cross-species approach to the study of brain and behaviour can advance our understanding of human disorders via the identification of unrecognized natural models of spontaneous disorders, thus revealing novel factors that increase vulnerability or resilience, and via the assessment of potential therapies. Moreover, diagnostic and therapeutic advances in human neurology and psychiatry can often be adapted for veterinary patients. However, clinical and research collaborations between physicians and veterinarians remain limited, leaving this wealth of comparative information largely untapped. Here, we review pain, cognitive decline syndromes, epilepsy, anxiety and compulsions, autoimmune and infectious encephalitides and mismatch disorders across a range of animal species, looking for novel insights with translational potential. This comparative perspective can help generate novel hypotheses, expand and improve clinical trials and identify natural animal models of disease resistance and vulnerability.","author_ids":["8427","8428","8429","8430","8431","8432","8433","8434"],"author_list":["Devinsky, Orrin","Boesch, Jordyn M","Cerda-Gonzalez, Sofia","Coffey, Barbara","Davis, Kathryn","Friedman, Daniel","Hainline, Brian","Houpt, Katherine","Lieberman, Daniel","Perry, Pamela","Pruss, Harald","Samuels, Martin A","Small, Gary W","Volk, Holger","Summerfield, Artur","Vite, Charles","Wisniewski, Thomas","Natterson-Horowitz, Barbara"],"date":"2018/10","id":"30287906","mesh_terms":[],"month":"10","title":"A cross-species approach to disorders affecting brain and behaviour.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"OBJECTIVEComplications after complex tethered spinal cord (cTSC) surgery include infections and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. With little empirical evidence to guide management, there is variability in the interventions undertaken to limit complications. Expert-based best practices may improve the care of patients undergoing cTSC surgery. Here, authors conducted a study to identify consensus-driven best practices.METHODSThe Delphi method was employed to identify consensual best practices. A literature review regarding cTSC surgery together with a survey of current practices was distributed to 17 board-certified pediatric neurosurgeons. Thirty statements were then formulated and distributed to the group. Results of the second survey were discussed during an in-person meeting leading to further consensus, which was defined as >/= 80% agreement on a 4-point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree).RESULTSSeventeen consensus-driven best practices were identified, with all participants willing to incorporate them into their practice. There were four preoperative interventions: (1, 2) asymptomatic AND symptomatic patients should be referred to urology preoperatively, (3, 4) routine preoperative urine cultures are not necessary for asymptomatic AND symptomatic patients. There were nine intraoperative interventions: (5) patients should receive perioperative cefazolin or an equivalent alternative in the event of allergy, (6) chlorhexidine-based skin preparation is the preferred regimen, (7) saline irrigation should be used intermittently throughout the case, (8) antibiotic-containing irrigation should be used following dural closure, (9) a nonlocking running suture technique should be used for dural closure, (10) dural graft overlay should be used when unable to obtain primary dural closure, (11) an expansile dural graft should be incorporated in cases of lipomyelomeningocele in which primary dural closure does not permit free flow of CSF, (12) paraxial muscles should be closed as a layer separate from the fascia, (13) routine placement of postoperative drains is not necessary. There were three postoperative interventions: (14) postoperative antibiotics are an option and, if given, should be discontinued within 24 hours; (15) patients should remain flat for at least 24 hours postoperatively; (16) routine use of abdominal binders or other compressive devices postoperatively is not necessary. One intervention was prioritized for additional study: (17) further study of additional gram-negative perioperative coverage is needed.CONCLUSIONSA modified Delphi technique was used to develop consensus-driven best practices for decreasing wound complications after cTSC surgery. Further study is required to determine if implementation of these practices will lead to reduced complications. Discussion through the course of this study resulted in the initiation of a multicenter study of gram-negative surgical site infections in cTSC surgery.","author_ids":["9092","4915","9093","3738","9094","9095","9096","9097","9098","9099"],"author_list":["Alexiades, Nikita G","Ahn, Edward S","Blount, Jeffrey P","Brockmeyer, Douglas L","Browd, Samuel R","Grant, Gerald A","Heuer, Gregory G","Hankinson, Todd C","Iskandar, Bermans J","Jea, Andrew","Krieger, Mark D","Leonard, Jeffrey R","Limbrick, David D","Maher, Cormac O","Proctor, Mark R","Sandberg, David I","Wellons, John C","Shao, Belinda","Feldstein, Neil A","Anderson, Richard C E"],"date":"2018/09","id":"30215584","mesh_terms":["Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak","Spine","Surgical Wound Infection"],"month":"09","title":"Development of best practices to minimize wound complications after complex tethered spinal cord surgery: a modified Delphi study.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"Importance: In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the research guiding pediatric mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) clinical management, in large part because of heightened concerns about the consequences of mTBI, also known as concussion, in children. The CDC National Center for Injury Prevention and Control's (NCIPC) Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC), a federal advisory committee, established the Pediatric Mild TBI Guideline workgroup to complete this systematic review summarizing the first 25 years of literature in this field of study. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the pediatric mTBI literature to serve as the foundation for an evidence-based guideline with clinical recommendations associated with the diagnosis and management of pediatric mTBI. Evidence Review: Using a modified Delphi process, the authors selected 6 clinical questions on diagnosis, prognosis, and management or treatment of pediatric mTBI. Two consecutive searches were conducted on PubMed, Embase, ERIC, CINAHL, and SportDiscus. The first included the dates January 1, 1990, to November 30, 2012, and an updated search included December 1, 2012, to July 31, 2015. The initial search was completed from December 2012 to January 2013; the updated search, from July 2015 to August 2015. Two authors worked in pairs to abstract study characteristics independently for each article selected for inclusion. A third author adjudicated disagreements. The risk of bias in each study was determined using the American Academy of Neurology Classification of Evidence Scheme. Conclusion statements were developed regarding the evidence within each clinical question, and a level of confidence in the evidence was assigned to each conclusion using a modified GRADE methodology. Data analysis was completed from October 2014 to May 2015 for the initial search and from November 2015 to April 2016 for the updated search. Findings: Validated tools are available to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and management of pediatric mTBI. A significant body of research exists to identify features that are associated with more serious TBI-associated intracranial injury, delayed recovery from mTBI, and long-term sequelae. However, high-quality studies of treatments meant to improve mTBI outcomes are currently lacking. Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review was used to develop an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of pediatric mTBI. While an increasing amount of research provides clinically useful information, this systematic review identified key gaps in diagnosis, prognosis, and management.","author_ids":["9296","9297","9298","2071","9299","9300","9301","9302","9303","9304","9305","9306","9307","504","9308","9309","9140","9310","9311","9312","9313","9314","9315","9316"],"author_list":["Lumba-Brown, Angela","Yeates, Keith Owen","Sarmiento, Kelly","Breiding, Matthew J","Haegerich, Tamara M","Gioia, Gerard A","Turner, Michael","Benzel, Edward C","Suskauer, Stacy J","Giza, Christopher C","Joseph, Madeline","Broomand, Catherine","Weissman, Barbara","Gordon, Wayne","Wright, David W","Moser, Rosemarie Scolaro","McAvoy, Karen","Ewing-Cobbs, Linda","Duhaime, Ann-Christine","Putukian, Margot","Holshouser, Barbara","Paulk, David","Wade, Shari L","Herring, Stanley A","Halstead, Mark","Keenan, Heather T","Choe, Meeryo","Christian, Cindy W","Guskiewicz, Kevin","Raksin, P B","Gregory, Andrew","Mucha, Anne","Taylor, H Gerry","Callahan, James M","DeWitt, John","Collins, Michael W","Kirkwood, Michael W","Ragheb, John","Ellenbogen, Richard G","Spinks, T J","Ganiats, Theodore G","Sabelhaus, Linda J","Altenhofen, Katrina","Hoffman, Rosanne","Getchius, Tom","Gronseth, Gary","Donnell, Zoe","O'Connor, Robert E","Timmons, Shelly D"],"date":"2018/09","id":"30193325","mesh_terms":[],"month":"09","title":"Diagnosis and Management of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Children: A Systematic Review.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"PURPOSE: We investigated the relationship of painful bladder filling and urinary urgency to somatic and chronic pain symptoms in women with overactive bladder without an interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women who met overactive bladder criteria based on symptoms were recruited, including 183 (83.9%) from the community and 35 (16.1%) from the urology clinic to complete validated questionnaires assessing urinary symptoms, somatic symptoms and pain syndromes. Participants were categorized into 1 of 3 groups, including 1) neither symptom, 2) either symptom or 3) both symptoms, based on their reports of painful urinary urgency and/or painful bladder filling. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to determine factors predictive of having painful urgency and/or painful filling. RESULTS: Of 218 women with overactive bladder 101 (46%) had neither painful bladder filling nor urinary urgency, 94 (43%) had either symptom and 23 (11%) had both symptoms. When controlling for age, women with either or both urological pain symptoms were more likely to have irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic pain and temporomandibular disorder than women in the neither group. Additionally, these women had higher pain intensity and somatic symptoms scores than women with neither symptom. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women with overactive bladder who had not been diagnosed with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome reported painful urgency and/or painful filling. Experiencing painful urgency and/or filling was associated with an increased somatic symptom burden and greater pain intensity. These findings support the hypothesis that overactive bladder and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome diagnoses may represent a continuum of bladder hypersensitivity.","author_ids":["10956","9926"],"author_list":["Kowalik, Casey G","Cohn, Joshua A","Delpe, Sophia","Kaufman, Melissa R","Wein, Alan","Dmochowski, Roger R","Reynolds, W Stuart"],"date":"2018/07","id":"30017963","mesh_terms":["Chronic Pain","Cystitis","Nociceptive Pain","Patient Reported Outcome Measures","Urinary Bladder"],"month":"07","title":"Painful Bladder Symptoms Related to Somatic Syndromes in a Convenience Sample of Community Women with Overactive Bladder Symptoms.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize the reasons manuscripts are rejected after peer review from the journal Headache. BACKGROUND: Numerous editorials, reviews, and research manuscripts have been published on the topic of manuscript rejection. However, few of these papers evaluate the reasons for rejection after peer review systematically. None are specific to the field of neurology or headache medicine. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all submissions to Headache from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016 was performed. Peer reviewer and editor comments for each manuscript were reviewed, and unlimited reasons for rejection were coded for each manuscript. Detailed reasons for rejection were then grouped into 9 broader categories. RESULTS: A total of 784 submissions were received from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016. Of those, 336 were immediately rejected and 434 went on to peer review. During this period, the overall rejection rate was 62.6% and the rejection rate after peer review was 35.7%. The 6 most common reasons for rejection after peer review were: flaws in methodology and study design, poor reporting of methodology, poor statistical analysis, overstatement of conclusions, problems with covariates or outcomes, and problems with the control or case group.

METHODS: Between September 2015 and October 2017, a specialist interest group including neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, nursing, primary care doctors and patient representatives met. An initial UK survey of attitudes and practice in IIH was sent to a wide group of physicians and surgeons who investigate and manage IIH regularly. A comprehensive systematic literature review was performed to assemble the foundations of the statements. An international panel along with four national professional bodies, namely the Association of British Neurologists, British Association for the Study of Headache, the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists critically reviewed the statements. RESULTS: Over 20 questions were constructed: one based on the diagnostic principles for optimal investigation of papilloedema and 21 for the management of IIH. Three main principles were identified: (1) to treat the underlying disease; (2) to protect the vision; and (3) to minimise the headache morbidity. Statements presented provide insight to uncertainties in IIH where research opportunities exist.

Little is known, however, about provider perception of the clinical relevance of, or how they might use, patient SO/GI information in individual care. OBJECTIVE: To explore providers' perspectives on and experiences with collection of patient SO/GI information and how the knowledge of this information may impact clinical care. DESIGN: Qualitative study using in-depth individual interviews of healthcare providers. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five healthcare providers, including physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, from the fields of family medicine, internal medicine, gynecology, and urology within a single healthcare system in an east coast city. APPROACH: Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using principles of grounded theory and thematic analysis to identify themes emerging from the data. KEY RESULTS: Providers recognized the importance of collecting patient SO/GI information for understanding population-level public health concerns and disparities, as well as understanding and respecting the context of patients' lives. However, providers also emphasized the importance of knowing patients' sexual behaviors and physical anatomy for addressing health risk and preventive care needs-and noted the distinction between these characteristics and patient SO/GI. Providers cautioned that assumptions based on knowledge of patient SO/GI may unintentionally obscure accurate profiles of patient behavior and anatomy. CONCLUSIONS: Along with the potential benefits of routine collection of patient SO/GI, it is important that providers continue to inquire about patient behaviors and anatomy to inform individual risk and needs assessments. Findings from this study can inform the development of guidelines, trainings, and practices for incorporation of patient SO/GI along with existing assessment practices to improve individual and population health.","author_ids":["5510","5512","12396"],"author_list":["Dichter, Melissa E","Ogden, Shannon N","Scheffey, Kathryn L"],"date":"2018/06","id":"29855864","mesh_terms":["Gender Identity","Sexual Behavior"],"month":"06","title":"Provider Perspectives on the Application of Patient Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Clinical Care: A Qualitative Study.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether women with overactive bladder who required third line therapy would demonstrate greater central sensitization, indexed by temporal summation to heat pain stimuli, than those with overactive bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 39 women with overactive bladder from the urology clinic who were planning to undergo interventional therapy for medication refractory overactive bladder with onabotulinumtoxinA bladder injection or sacral neuromodulation. We also recruited 55 women with overactive bladder who were newly seen at our urology clinic or who responded to advertisements for study participation. Participants underwent quantitative sensory testing using a thermal temporal summation protocol. The primary study outcome was the degree of temporal summation as reflected in the magnitude of positive slope of the line fit to the series of 10 stimuli at a 49C target temperature. We compared the degree of temporal summation between the study groups using linear regression. RESULTS: Women in the group undergoing third line therapy showed significantly higher standardized temporal summation slopes than those in the nontreatment group (beta = 1.57, 95% CI 0.18-2.96, t = 2.25, p = 0.027). On exploratory analyses a history of incontinence surgery or hysterectomy was associated with significantly greater temporal summation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study the degree of temporal summation was elevated in women undergoing third line overactive bladder therapy compared to women with overactive bladder who were not undergoing that therapy. These findings suggest there may be pathophysiological differences, specifically in afferent nerve function and processing, in some women with overactive bladder.","author_ids":["12920","9926"],"author_list":["Reynolds, W Stuart","Kowalik, Casey","Cohn, Joshua","Kaufman, Melissa","Wein, Alan","Dmochowski, Roger","Bruehl, Stephen"],"date":"2018/05","id":"29746857","mesh_terms":["Central Nervous System Sensitization","Patient Reported Outcome Measures","Postsynaptic Potential Summation","Urinary Bladder","Urinary Incontinence"],"month":"05","title":"Women Undergoing Third Line Overactive Bladder Treatment Demonstrate Elevated Thermal Temporal Summation.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we summarize research that has evaluated the role of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) and robotic surgery in pediatric urology, highlighting new and/or controversial ideas.

Subjects were identified through our electronic medical system as those evaluated by the Program's single clinical genetic counselor in that period. A total of 377 patients were evaluated by the Penn Neurogenetics Program in different settings and genetic testing recommended. Of those, 182 (48%) were seen in subspecialty clinic setting and 195 (52%) in a General Neurogenetics Clinic. Genetic testing was completed in over 80% of patients in whom it was recommended. The diagnostic yield was 32% across disease groups. Stratified by testing modality, the yield was highest with directed testing (50%) and array comparative genomic hybridization (45%), followed by gene panels and exome testing (25% each). In conclusion, genetic testing can be successfully requested in clinic in a large majority of adult patients. Age is not a limiting factor for a genetic diagnostic evaluation and the yield of clinical testing across phenotypes (almost 30%) is consistent with previous phenotype-focused or research-based studies. These results should inform the development of specific guidelines for clinical testing and serve as evidence to improve reimbursement by insurance payers.","author_ids":["3503","2653","9619","14125","14209","1074","582"],"author_list":["Bardakjian, Tanya M","Helbig, Ingo","Quinn, Colin","Elman, Lauren B","McCluskey, Leo F","Scherer, Steven S","Gonzalez-Alegre, Pedro"],"date":"2018/03","id":"29589152","mesh_terms":["Neurology","Whole Exome Sequencing"],"month":"03","title":"Genetic test utilization and diagnostic yield in adult patients with neurological disorders.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There are advantages and disadvantages of subspecialty certification for physicians, trainees, patients, and society at large.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients 18 years old or younger who presented to an emergency department in South Carolina with a urinary stone from 1997 to 2015. The primary exposure was urology consultation during the index emergency department visit. The primary outcome was a stone related emergency department revisit occurring within 180 days of discharge from an index emergency department visit. Secondary outcomes included computerized tomography use, inpatient admission and emergent surgery. RESULTS: Of 5,642 index emergency department visits for acute urinary stones 11% resulted in at least 1 stone related emergency department revisit within 180 days. Of revisits 59% occurred within 30 days of discharge and 39% were due to pain. The odds of emergency department revisit were highest within the first 48 hours of discharge home (OR 22.6, 95% CI 18.0 to 28.5) and rapidly decreased thereafter. Urology consultation was associated with a 37% lower adjusted odds of emergency department revisit (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90) and 68% lower odds of computerized tomography use across all emergency department visits (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.69). Among patients who revisited the emergency department the frequency of pain complaints was 27% in those with a urological consultation at the index visit and 39% in those without. CONCLUSIONS: Urology consultation was associated with decreased emergency department revisits and computerized tomography use in pediatric patients with urinary stones. Future studies should identify patients who benefit most from urology consultation and ascertain processes of care that decrease emergency department revisits among high risk patients.","author_ids":["43","6958","15237","11336","44"],"author_list":["Kurtzman, Jane T","Song, Lihai","Ross, Michelle E","Scales, Charles D Jr","Chu, David I","Tasian, Gregory E"],"date":"2018/02","id":"29474848","mesh_terms":["Adolescent","Child","Child, Preschool","Emergency Service, Hospital","Facilities and Services Utilization","Hospitalization","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Referral and Consultation","Retrospective Studies","South Carolina","Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Urinary Calculi","Hospitals","Nephrolithiasis","Patient Readmission","Pediatrics","Urinary Calculi"],"month":"02","title":"Urology Consultation and Emergency Department Revisits for Children with Urinary Stone Disease.","year":"2018"},{"abstract":"In response to a number of recent lawsuits related to brain death determination, the American Academy of Neurology Ethics, Law, and Humanities Committee convened a multisociety quality improvement summit in October 2016 to address, and potentially correct, aspects of brain death determination within the purview of medical practice that may have contributed to these lawsuits.

Once satisfied with mapping metabolic pathways at organ level, we are now looking to learn what it is exactly that metabolic enzymes and transporters do and when, where do they reside, how are they regulated, and how do they relate to the specific functions of neurons, glial cells, and their subcellular domains and organelles, in different areas of the brain. Moreover, we aim to quantify the fluxes of metabolites within and between cells. Energy metabolism is not just a necessity for proper cell function and viability but plays specific roles in higher brain functions such as memory processing and behavior, whose mechanisms need to be understood at all hierarchical levels, from isolated proteins to whole subjects, in both health and disease. To this aim, the field takes advantage of diverse disciplines including anatomy, histology, physiology, biochemistry, bioenergetics, cellular biology, molecular biology, developmental biology, neurology, and mathematical modeling. This article presents a well-referenced synopsis of the technical side of brain energy metabolism research.

EEG is a reliable test to assess cerebral function. It aids in diagnosis, classification, and management of patients with epilepsy. It also has practical uses in conditions other than epilepsy. Moreover, it is harmless and inexpensive. EEG is an important tool for evaluating patients with epilepsy. It may help classify the syndrome, identify the likely source of focal seizures, and confirm a diagnosis of status epilepticus. EEG is therefore helpful when selecting appropriate antiepileptic drugs for patients with epilepsy, is valuable for diagnosis and management of status epilepticus as well as predicting the prognosis in epilepsy syndromes, and, is finally useful when localizing an area for resection in surgery candidates. In addition, despite advances in neuroimaging, EEG remains a valuable tool in the evaluation of stuporous and comatose patients. A systematic approach is essential for EEG interpretation, and when combined with good clinical judgment, it will improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and may improve therapeutic outcomes. This EEG atlas is designed as a practical guide for neurology residents, neurologists, and epileptologists, so that they may appropriately identify normal and abnormal findings, while reading an EEG. By reading and reviewing the relevant chapter of this well-organized atlas, that includes many EEG images, the reader will also learn how to report an EEG finding. We hope that this atlas fills an unmet need, and leads to improved patient care.","author_ids":["19476","11653","19477","18791"],"author_list":["Asadi-Pooya, Ali Akbar","Dlugos, Dennis","Skidmore, Christopher","Sperling, Michael R"],"date":"2017/09","id":"28872032","mesh_terms":["Brain Mapping","Electroencephalography","Humans","Artifacts"],"month":"09","title":"Atlas of Electroencephalography, 3rd Edition.","year":"2017"},{"abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves damage to white matter microstructures. This damage has been related to grey matter function as measured by standard, physiologically-nonspecific neuroimaging indices (i.e., blood-oxygen-level dependent signal [BOLD]). Here, we used calibrated functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to examine the extent to which specific, evoked grey matter physiological processes were associated with white matter diffusion in MS. Evoked changes in BOLD, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and oxygen metabolism (CMRO2 ) were measured in visual cortex. Individual differences in the diffusion tensor measure, radial diffusivity, within occipital tracts were strongly associated with MS patients' BOLD and CMRO2 . However, these relationships were in opposite directions, complicating the interpretation of the relationship between BOLD and white matter microstructural damage in MS. CMRO2 was strongly associated with individual differences in patients' fatigue and neurological disability, suggesting that alterations to evoked oxygen metabolic processes may be taken as a marker for primary symptoms of MS. This work demonstrates the first application of calibrated and diffusion imaging together and details the first application of calibrated functional MRI in a neurological population. Results lend support for neuroenergetic hypotheses of MS pathophysiology and provide an initial demonstration of the utility of evoked oxygen metabolism signals for neurology research.

In the current study, the authors sought to determine whether access to care, measured across multiple dimensions, contributed to racial differences in prostate cancer. METHODS: The Philadelphia Area Prostate Cancer Access Study (P(2) Access) included 2374 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2012 and 2014. Men were surveyed to assess their experiences accessing care (response rate of 51.1%). The authors determined appointment availability at 151 urology practices using simulated patient telephone calls and calculated travel distances using geospatial techniques. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association between 5 different domains of access (availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability, and acceptability) and receipt of treatment, perceived quality of care, and physician-patient communication. RESULTS: There were 1907 non-Hispanic white and 394 black men in the study cohort. Overall, approximately 85% of the men received definitive treatment with no differences noted by race. Black men were less likely to report a high quality of care (69% vs 81%; P<.001) and good physician-patient communication (60% vs 71%; P<.001) compared with white men. In adjusted models, none of the 5 domains of access were found to be associated with definitive treatment overall or with radical prostatectomy. All access domains were associated with perceived quality of care and communication, although these domains did not mediate racial disparities. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the current study presents the first comprehensive assessment of prostate cancer care access, treatment, and patient experience, demonstrating that although access was related to overall perceived quality of care and better physician-patient communication, it did not appear to explain observed racial differences.

RECENT FINDINGS: Bilateral heterologous hand-forearm transplantation was performed in a child with a prior kidney transplant in July 2015. The initial surgery necessitated a large team of experts in microvascular surgery, transplant surgery, orthopedics and plastic surgery as well as pediatric anesthesia. Medical management has highlighted the need for extensive multidisciplinary support with pediatric expertise in transplant medicine, occupational therapy and rehabilitation, neurology, and neuroradiology. The clinical course has been complicated by the need for robust immunosuppression to control ongoing, even though low-grade, and intermittent rejection. Neurological findings have demonstrated cortical neuroplasticity with reorganization of the somatosensory cortex. SUMMARY: Heterologous hand-forearm transplantation in a child is feasible and has the potential for functional benefit to improve quality of life; however, immunological and ethical concerns warrant proceeding with caution.

Value-based healthcare is a proposed strategy to improve outcomes and decrease costs. To move towards an actual value-based health care system, condition-specific outcomes that are meaningful to patients are essential. OBJECTIVE: Propose a global consensus standard set of outcome measures for PD. METHODS: Established methods for outcome measure development were applied, as outlined and used previously by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM). An international group, representing both patients and experts from the fields of neurology, psychiatry, nursing, and existing outcome measurement efforts, was convened. The group participated in six teleconferences over a six-month period, reviewed existing data and practices, and ultimately proposed a standard set of measures by which patients should be tracked, and how often data should be collected. RESULTS: The standard set applies to all cases of idiopathic PD, and includes assessments of motor and non-motor symptoms, ability to work, PD-related health status, and hospital admissions. Baseline demographic and clinical variables are included to enable case mix adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: The Standard Set is now ready for use and pilot testing in the clinical setting. Ultimately, we believe that using the set of outcomes proposed here will allow clinicians and scientists across the world to document, report, and compare PD-related outcomes in a standardized fashion. Such international benchmarks will improve our understanding of the disease course and allow for identification of 'best practices', ultimately leading to better informed treatment decisions.","author_ids":["779"],"author_list":["de Roos, Paul","Bloem, Bastiaan R","Kelley, Thomas A","Antonini, Angelo","Dodel, Richard","Hagell, Peter","Marras, Connie","Martinez-Martin, Pablo","Mehta, Shyamal H","Odin, Per","Chaudhuri, Kallol Ray","Weintraub, Daniel","Wilson, Bil","Uitti, Ryan J"],"date":"2017/07","id":"28671140","mesh_terms":["Consensus","Health Status","Humans","Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","Parkinson Disease","Societies, Medical","Treatment Outcome","Activities of Daily Living","Aged","Delivery of Health Care","Delivery of Health Care","Disability Evaluation","Disease Progression","Efficiency","Delivery of Health Care","Health Surveys","Health Surveys","Humans","International Cooperation","Middle Aged","Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)","Parkinson Disease","Parkinson Disease","Parkinson Disease","Parkinsonian Disorders","Psychometrics","Quality of Health Care","Quality of Life"],"month":"07","title":"A Consensus Set of Outcomes for Parkinson's Disease from the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement.","year":"2017"},{"abstract":"A growing population of patients are now surviving the Fontan procedure and face an uncertain future and a clear burden of disease.

RECENT FINDINGS: Among pediatric patients, kidney stone disease has been increasing at a rate of approximately 5-10% annually. Kidney stone disease has been associated with increased risks of coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and decreased bone mineral density, which is concerning for patients diagnosed at a young age. Improvements in endo-urology have allowed for less invasive surgical treatment of stones in the pediatric population. However, current guidelines often lack recommendations for evaluation, medical, and surgical management of children with kidney stone disease. Nephrolithiasis is a disorder of mineral metabolism, which is beginning during childhood with increasing frequency. Kidney stone disease often exists over the lifetime and is associated with serious conditions that are important for pediatric and adult urologists to recognize and consider in their evaluation and treatment of patients.","author_ids":["22257","44"],"author_list":["Bonzo, Jeremy R","Tasian, Gregory E"],"date":"2017/04","id":"28417430","mesh_terms":["Adolescent","Adult","Bone Density","Child","Child, Preschool","Coronary Disease","Fractures, Bone","Humans","Hypertension","Incidence","Kidney Calculi","Renal Insufficiency, Chronic","Secondary Prevention","Young Adult","Child","Nephrolithiasis","Patient Transfer"],"month":"04","title":"The Emergence of Kidney Stone Disease During Childhood-Impact on Adults.","year":"2017"},{"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are devastating hypersensitivity disorders that cause epidermal cell death and can affect all epidermal surfaces, including the urethra, vagina, labial and scrotal skin. Despite the well-described ocular and orofacial manifestations of SJS/TEN, there is a paucity of reports on the genitourinary (GU) symptoms and their management. Specifically, consulting services often ask the pediatric urology team if it is safe to place a urethral catheter, but there is no data in the literature to help guide management. The present study sought to review all pediatric cases of SJS/TEN in a tertiary care hospital to determine the incidence and optimal management of GU manifestations, including the use of urethral catheters. METHODS: With IRB approval, cases of SJS and TEN that were managed as an inpatient between January 2008 and June 2015 were retrospectively reviewed in order to identify the extent of GU involvement/manifestations, the treatment provided, use of urethral catheterization and long-term follow-up or complications. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (15 female, 16 male; age range 2-18 years) presented with SJS or TEN over the study period. Etiologies for SJS/TEN included mycoplasma infection (48%) and medications (45%). Incidences of GU manifestations at presentation and their management are shown in Summary Table. Overall, 74% of patients had genital involvement of skin lesions. In 12 cases (39%), urology consultation was obtained. Twenty patients (61%) complained of dysuria and one child had gross hematuria in the setting of meatal lesion. Petroleum jelly was used in the majority of patients. A urethral catheter was placed in eight patients (25.8%, four female, four male) with a range of duration of 7-23 days. No patient developed hematuria or any other complications (i.e. strictures or urinary symptoms) after catheter removal. One boy required lysis of penile adhesions in the short-term. One of each gender developed penile and labial adhesions on long-term follow-up that self-resolved. CONCLUSIONS: GU involvement in SJS/TEN occurred in almost three-quarters of patients and was managed conservatively like other skin/mucosal manifestations. Long-term sequelae were rare and urethral catheterization appeared to be safe, without any short-term or long-term complications.","author_ids":["3547","8838","11955","22875","11959","11954"],"author_list":["Van Batavia, J P","Chu, D I","Long, C J","Jen, M","Canning, D A","Weiss, D A"],"date":"2017/03","id":"28314701","mesh_terms":["Adolescent","Age Factors","Child","Cohort Studies","Comorbidity","Disease Management","Female Urogenital Diseases","Follow-Up Studies","Humans","Incidence","Male Urogenital Diseases","Petrolatum","Retrospective Studies","Risk Assessment","Severity of Illness Index","Sex Factors","Statistics, Nonparametric","Stevens-Johnson Syndrome","Tertiary Care Centers","Treatment Outcome","Pediatrics","Stevens-Johnson Syndrome","Stevens-Johnson Syndrome","Urinary Catheters"],"month":"03","title":"Genitourinary involvement and management in children with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.","year":"2017"},{"abstract":"PURPOSE: The primary objective is to provide evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the pediatric and parent-proxy versions of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Peer Relations, Mobility, Pain Interference, and Fatigue item banks, the Neurology Quality of Life measurement system (Neuro-QOL) Cognition-General Concerns and Stigma item banks, and the Traumatic Brain Injury Quality of Life (TBI-QOL) Executive Function and Headache item banks in a pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) sample. METHODS: Participants were 134 parent-child (ages 8-18 years) days.
